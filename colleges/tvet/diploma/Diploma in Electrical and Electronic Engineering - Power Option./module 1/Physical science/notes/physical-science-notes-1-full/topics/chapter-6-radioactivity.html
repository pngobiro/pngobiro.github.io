                        <p>Radioactivity or radioactive decay is the spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclides to form stable ones with the emission of radiation. Unstable nuclides continue to disintegrate until a stable atom is formed.</p>
                        <p>Alpha ( <span class="math-inline">$\alpha$</span> ) and beta ( <span class="math-inline">$\beta$</span> ) particles are emitted and the gamma rays ( <span class="math-inline">$\gamma$</span> ) accompany the ejection of both alpha and beta particles.The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons.</p>
                        <p>They are surrounded by negatively charged ions known as electrons.The number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. Both protons and neutrons have the same mass.The weight of an electron is relatively small compared to neutrons and protons. The number of protons in an atom is referred to as the proton number (atomic number) and denoted by the symbol Z.The number of neutrons is denoted by the symbol N . Protons and neutrons are called nucleons since they form the nucleus of an atom.The sum of both the protons and neutrons is called the mass number A or nucleon number. Therefore;</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{A}=\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{N}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{Z}$.</span><br>
                        The masses of atoms are conveniently given in terms of atomic mass units (U) where (U) is <span class="math-inline">$1 / 12$</span> th the mass of one atom of carbon- 12 and has a value of <span class="math-inline">$1.660 \times 10-27 \mathrm{~kg}$</span>. Hence the mass of one proton is equal to <span class="math-inline">$1.67 \times 10-27$</span> and is equal to <span class="math-inline">$1 \mathrm{u}$</span>. Isotopes are elements with different mass numbers but with equal atomic numbers i.e. uranium with mass numbers 235 and 238.</p>

                                Radioactive elements can also be used as tracers in medicine where they determine the efficiency of organisms such as kidneys and thyroid glands.</span>
