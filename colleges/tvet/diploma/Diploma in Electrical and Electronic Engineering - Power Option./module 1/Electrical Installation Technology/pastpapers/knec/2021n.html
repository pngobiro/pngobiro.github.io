                                <p><strong>(a) Polarity Test Reasons, Instruments, and Readings</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Three Reasons for Verification of Polarity Test:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Safety During Operation/Maintenance:</strong> To ensure that single-pole switches, fuses, and circuit breakers are connected only in the line (phase) conductor. This guarantees that operating the switch/device isolates the appliance or circuit from the live supply, preventing shock risk during tasks like changing a lamp.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Correct Device Operation:</strong> To ensure that protective devices (fuses, MCBs) operate correctly by interrupting the flow of current in the phase conductor under fault conditions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Appliance Safety & Function:</strong> To ensure correct connections within accessories, such as verifying the centre contact of Edison Screw (ES) lampholders is connected to the phase conductor and the outer screw to neutral, reducing the risk of accidental contact with live parts when inserting/removing a lamp. Also ensures correct operation of appliances sensitive to polarity.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Instruments Used and Expected Readings:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Instrument(s):</strong>
                                        <ul><li>For **Dead Testing:** Low-resistance ohmmeter or Continuity Tester.</li>
                                            <li>For **Live Testing:** Approved Voltage Indicator (AVI) or Test Lamp conforming to safety standards (e.g., GS38).</li></ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Expected Readings (Examples using Dead Test Method - see Q4(c) 2015j for procedure):</strong>
                                        <ul><li>**Continuity Test (Low Ohms):** Expected between the Line conductor at the origin (linked to Earth temporarily) and the Line terminal(s) of switches, the centre contact of ES lampholders, or the Line terminal of socket outlets.</li>
                                            <li>**No Continuity (High Resistance / Open Circuit):** Expected between the Line conductor at the origin (linked to Earth) and any Neutral terminal or the outer contact of an ES lampholder.</li></ul>
                                    </li>
                                     <li><strong>Expected Readings (Examples using Live Test Method - see Q1(c) 2016j for procedure):**
                                        <ul><li>**Full Voltage:** Expected between Line and Earth, and between Switched Line (when ON) and Earth.</li>
                                            <li>**Zero/Near Zero Voltage:** Expected between Neutral and Earth, and between Switched Line (when OFF) and Earth.</li></ul>
                                    </li>

                                    <li><strong>Component Failure Can Cause False Alarm:</strong> While good for tamper detection, a simple component failure (e.g., a faulty sensor contact sticking open, a break in the wire due to non-malicious damage) will also break the circuit and trigger a false alarm.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> The system constantly consumes a small amount of power to keep the control relay energized when armed. While usually low, this is higher than an open-circuit system which only draws power when triggered.</li>
                                    <!-- <li>Complexity/Cost: Can be slightly more complex and potentially costly than very basic open-circuit systems, though widely used due to security benefits.</li> -->

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Polarity tests are vital for safety and correct operation. Ammeters connect in series, voltmeters in parallel. Closed-circuit alarms offer tamper detection but can false alarm on component failure. Safe battery charging requires ventilation, PPE, and avoiding ignition sources, using methods like CC, CV, or multi-stage charging.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Nuclear Power Plant Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Two Advantages:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Nuclear fission does not directly produce CO₂ or other greenhouse gases during operation, making it a low-carbon source of electricity helpful in combating climate change.</li>
                                        <li><strong>High Power Density / Land Use Efficiency:</strong> Nuclear power plants generate a very large amount of energy from a small amount of fuel (uranium) and typically require less land area per unit of energy produced compared to some renewables like solar farms or large hydro reservoirs.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reliable Base Load Power:</strong> Nuclear plants can operate continuously for long periods (1-2 years between refueling) at high capacity factors, providing a reliable source of base-load electricity independent of weather conditions.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Two Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Radioactive Waste Management:</strong> The process produces long-lasting, highly radioactive waste (spent fuel) that requires complex, secure, and very long-term storage and disposal solutions, posing environmental and security challenges.</li>
                                        <li><strong>High Capital Costs and Construction Time:</strong> Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build and take many years (often over a decade) to construct due to complex engineering and stringent safety requirements.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Safety Concerns / Accident Risk:</strong> Although rare, severe accidents (like Chernobyl, Fukushima) can have catastrophic and long-lasting environmental and health consequences. Public perception regarding safety remains a significant issue.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nuclear Proliferation Risk:</strong> The technology and materials involved in nuclear power can potentially be diverted for military purposes, raising concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li><strong>Provision for Isolation:</strong> Accessible main switch/breaker to disconnect the whole installation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Overcurrent Protection:</strong> Supplier's main fuse (cut-out) and consumer's coordinated main protection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Earthing Connection:</strong> Provision of a Main Earthing Terminal (MET) correctly connected to the means of earthing (supplier's terminal or consumer electrode).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessibility & Marking:</strong> Equipment should be accessible and clearly labelled.</li>

                                    <p class="key-point">The question asked for three.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Distinction Between Ring and Radial Final Circuits (for Sockets):**</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Radial Circuit:</strong> The circuit cable runs directly from the protective device (MCB/fuse) in the consumer unit to the first socket outlet, then potentially "daisy-chains" to subsequent sockets in a line, ending at the last socket. The cable does *not* return to the consumer unit. Current flows only one way along the cable.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ring Circuit (Ring Final Circuit):</strong> The circuit cable starts from the protective device, runs sequentially through all the connected socket outlets, and then returns back to *the same* protective device terminals in the consumer unit, forming a closed loop or ring. Current can flow in both directions around the ring to supply the connected loads.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Radial circuits have one path from the consumer unit; Ring circuits have two parallel paths forming a loop back to the consumer unit.</p>

                                    <p>This requires interpreting the layout in Figure 1 and creating a plausible loop-in wiring diagram. Assume standard single-gang, one-way switches unless otherwise indicated. Independent control means each switch controls only its designated lamp(s).</p>

                                    <p class="answer-intro">This answer defines ambient temperature, explains heat effects on materials, describes soldering methods, identifies conduit fittings, and outlines steel conduit installation procedure.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Ambient Temperature and Heat Effects</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Ambient Temperature Definition:**</p>
                                    <p>The temperature of the surrounding medium (usually air, but could be water or soil) in the immediate vicinity of an electrical component or cable, before the component itself generates any heat due to its operation. It's the baseline temperature influencing heat dissipation.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Effect of Heat on Materials:**</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>(I) Pure Metals (e.g., Copper, Aluminium):</strong> Generally, increasing temperature increases the electrical resistance of pure metals due to increased thermal vibration of the atoms hindering electron flow (positive temperature coefficient of resistance). Heat also causes thermal expansion and can eventually lead to softening or melting at high enough temperatures.</li>
                                        <li><strong>(II) Alloys:</strong> The effect of heat on resistance varies depending on the specific alloy. Some alloys (like Manganin, Constantan) are designed to have a very low temperature coefficient of resistance, making them suitable for precision resistors. Other alloys behave similarly to pure metals (resistance increases with temperature). Thermal expansion occurs, and melting points depend on the alloy composition.</li>
                                        <li><strong>(III) Carbon and Electrolytes:</strong> These generally exhibit a *negative* temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning their electrical resistance *decreases* as temperature increases (within certain limits). For carbon (like in motor brushes), higher temperature increases charge carrier availability. For electrolytes (like in batteries), higher temperature increases ion mobility, reducing resistance. However, excessive heat can cause degradation, boiling (electrolytes), or unwanted chemical reactions.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Methods of Joining Electrical Conductors (Soldering)</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Soldering Bit (Soldering Iron):**</p>
                                    <p>Using a hand-held tool (soldering iron) with an electrically heated metal tip (the bit). The hot bit is applied to the cleaned and fluxed conductors to be joined, heating them up. Solder wire (cored with flux or used with separate flux) is then touched to the heated joint (not the iron tip directly), melting and flowing into the joint via capillary action. The iron is removed, and the solder solidifies, creating the bond. Suitable for smaller wires and electronic components.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Pot and Ladle:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q1(a)(i) in 2016j paper). A method for larger cables where solder is melted in a container (pot) heated externally (e.g., by gas). The prepared, fluxed joint is positioned, and molten solder is poured over it using a ladle until the joint is fully filled/tinned. Requires careful handling of molten metal.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Planning & Marking:</strong> Mark the intended route of the conduit run on the surface (wall/ceiling), indicating positions of boxes, bends, and fixing points (saddles).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cutting Conduit:</strong> Measure and cut required straight lengths of steel conduit using a hacksaw (fine-toothed blade) in a pipe vice. Ensure cuts are square.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reaming & Cleaning:</strong> Remove sharp internal burrs from cut ends using a reamer or round file to prevent cable damage during pulling. Clean ends.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Threading (if using threaded fittings):</strong> Secure conduit in pipe vice. Use appropriate die in a stock (with cutting fluid) to cut standard electrical threads on the conduit ends where connections to boxes or threaded fittings are needed.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bending (if not using pre-formed bends):</strong> Use a conduit bending machine or bending springs (for lighter gauge) to form bends as required, avoiding kinks or flattening the conduit.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Assembling Run:</strong> Fit boxes, bends, couplers, and straight lengths together. For threaded systems, screw components tightly. For plain/lug-grip systems, ensure conduit is fully inserted and grub screws tightened (ensure earth continuity).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fixing to Surface:</strong> Secure the assembled conduit run to the surface using saddles at appropriate intervals (e.g., within 300mm of boxes/bends and typically every 1-1.5m on straight runs), ensuring the run is straight and properly aligned. Use appropriate screws/fixings for the surface material.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fitting Bushes & Locknuts:</strong> Where conduit enters boxes, fit appropriate male bushes and secure firmly with lock nuts inside the box to ensure mechanical security and earth continuity.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Drawing In Cables:</strong> Once the conduit system is complete and secure, draw in the required electrical cables using draw wire or tape if necessary.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Ambient temperature is the surrounding temperature. Heat increases resistance in metals but decreases it in carbon/electrolytes. Soldering uses molten filler metal for joints. Steel conduit installation involves cutting, threading/bending, assembling fittings, fixing, and ensuring earth continuity before drawing cables.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(i) State of Charge (SoC):**</p>
                                    <p>The level of electrical energy currently stored in a battery relative to its maximum capacity, usually expressed as a percentage (%). 100% SoC means the battery is fully charged; 0% SoC means it is fully discharged (though typically batteries should not be discharged below a certain level, e.g., 20-50% SoC, to preserve lifespan).</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Self-Discharge:**</p>
                                    <p>The gradual loss of stored charge (energy) within a battery over time due to internal chemical reactions, even when the battery is not connected to any load. The rate varies depending on battery chemistry, temperature (higher temp = higher rate), and age.</p>

It can either step-up (boost) the voltage to a higher level or step-down (buck) the voltage to a lower level. Used to match the voltage of a DC source to the requirement of a specific DC load or another part of the system.</li>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">PV module output is affected by sunlight, temperature, and shading. State of Charge indicates stored energy in a battery, while self-discharge is gradual loss. Inverters change DC to AC; converters change DC voltage levels. Solar cells work via the photovoltaic effect, with common types being monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Fuel Savings/Cost Reduction:</strong> Uses free solar energy, eliminating the need for firewood, charcoal, kerosene, or electricity for cooking, saving money and resources.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Reduces deforestation (less firewood needed), lowers indoor air pollution (compared to burning biomass indoors), and produces no greenhouse gas emissions during use.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> No open flames, reducing fire hazards and risk of burns compared to traditional cooking methods.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Convenience (in sunny conditions):</strong> Food can be left to cook slowly ("solar oven") without constant attention, freeing up time.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(c) PV Solar Sizing Terms Explanation</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily System Energy Requirement:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q8(c)(i) in 2019j paper). The total daily energy (Wh) the solar source (PV array/battery) must provide to power the loads PLUS compensate for all system energy losses (wiring, controller, battery, inverter etc.).</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Voltage Drop:**</p>
                                    <p>The reduction in electrical voltage that occurs along the length of a conductor as current flows through it, due to the conductor's resistance (V<sub>drop</sub> = I * R<sub>cable</sub>). In PV systems (especially low voltage DC), minimizing voltage drop by using appropriately sized cables for the current and distance is crucial to avoid significant power loss (P<sub>loss</sub> = I² * R<sub>cable</sub>) and ensure components operate within their required voltage range.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Load Demand and PV Module Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p>Loads:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lamp: 1 x 8W x 4h = 32 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>Refrigerator: 1 x 60W x 24h = 1440 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>TV: 1 x 40W x 3h = 120 Wh/day</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily Load Demand (Energy):**</p>
                                    <p>Total Load Energy = 32 Wh + 1440 Wh + 120 Wh = <strong>1592 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>(ii) Number of PV Modules Required:**</p>
                                    <p>Given: PV Module Generation Factor = 3.4 (This likely represents the daily Wh output per Wp of panel rating, effectively incorporating average Peak Sun Hours and some derating factors, but *not* system losses as defined in the problem N.B.).</p>
                                    <p>System losses are neglected as per N.B., so the required generation equals the load demand = 1592 Wh/day.</p>
                                    <p>Required PV Array Watt-peak (Wp) = Total Daily Load Demand (Wh/day) / Generation Factor (Wh/day/Wp)</p>
                                    <p>Required Wp = 1592 Wh/day / 3.4 Wh/day/Wp</p>
                                    <p>Required Wp ≈ <strong>468.2 Wp</strong></p>
                                    <p>If we assume standard module sizes (e.g., 100Wp, 150Wp, 250Wp), we would need:</p>
                                    <ul><li>If using 100Wp modules: 468.2 / 100 ≈ 4.68 => **5 modules**</li>
                                        <li>If using 150Wp modules: 468.2 / 150 ≈ 3.12 => **4 modules**</li>
                                        <li>If using 250Wp modules: 468.2 / 250 ≈ 1.87 => **2 modules**</li></ul>
                                    <p>The number depends on the chosen module size. Assuming a common size like 150Wp, **4 modules** would be required.</p>
                                     <p class="key-point">It's crucial to understand what the "Generation Factor" represents. If it *already* accounts for average system losses, the calculation would use 1592 Wh directly. If not, and losses *should* have been included despite the NB, the target energy would be 1592 / (1-Loss%) before dividing by the factor.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Solar battery maintenance involves cleaning, watering (if applicable), and checking connections/charge. Installation must adhere to safety regulations regarding location, isolation, and protection. Lighting failures can stem from wiring, battery, or component faults. Sizing involves calculating energy demand and accounting for voltage drop, while autonomy dictates storage. Module requirements depend on load and the generation factor (PSH/derating).</p>
