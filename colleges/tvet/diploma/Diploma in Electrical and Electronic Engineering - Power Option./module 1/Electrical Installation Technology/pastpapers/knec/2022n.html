                                <p><strong>(a) Advantages of Cable Materials</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Copper:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>High Electrical Conductivity:</strong> Copper has excellent conductivity (second only to silver), allowing it to carry more current for a given size compared to other common conductors like aluminum, minimizing energy loss as heat.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ductility and Malleability:</strong> Copper is easily drawn into wires (ductile) and can be bent or shaped (malleable) without breaking easily, facilitating installation. It is also readily soldered or crimped for reliable connections.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Rubber (as used historically or in specific modern compounds):**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Natural and some synthetic rubbers offer excellent flexibility, making cables suitable for portable appliances or applications requiring frequent movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Water Resistance:</strong> Certain rubber compounds offer good resistance to moisture ingress.</li>
                                    <li><em>Note:</em> Traditional rubber insulation/sheathing had significant drawbacks (poor ageing, low temperature limits, poor oil resistance) and has largely been replaced by PVC, XLPE, EPR, CSP etc. for general wiring, though specialized rubber compounds are still used for demanding flexible cables.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) MIMS Cable and Advantages</strong></p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Exceptional Fire Resistance:</strong> The inorganic mineral insulation (MgO) and metal sheath do not burn and can withstand very high temperatures for extended periods, maintaining circuit integrity during a fire. Ideal for fire alarm and emergency lighting circuits.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High Mechanical Strength & Durability:</strong> The solid metal sheath provides excellent protection against impact, crushing, and abrasion. It is also impervious to water, oil, and many chemicals (especially with copper sheath).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Small Diameter:</strong> Offers a relatively small overall diameter for its current rating compared to other armoured cables.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Can Act as CPC:</strong> The metal sheath provides an effective circuit protective conductor.</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Wiring System Selection Factors and Flexible Conduit</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Factors Determining Type of Wiring System:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>I. Cost:</strong> The overall budget for the project significantly influences the choice. Material costs (PVC vs Steel conduit vs Trunking vs SWA cable) and labour costs (ease/speed of installation for different systems) are major considerations. Cheaper systems may be suitable for some applications but might lack durability or flexibility needed elsewhere.</li>
                                    <li><strong>II. Safety:</strong> The primary consideration. The chosen system must provide adequate protection against electric shock (proper insulation, earthing, containment), fire (appropriate materials, correct cable sizing, secure connections), and mechanical damage appropriate for the environment and usage. Compliance with safety regulations (e.g., BS 7671) is mandatory.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Two Reasons for Using Flexible Conduits:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Connection to Vibrating Equipment:</strong> To provide a final connection to machinery or equipment that vibrates during operation (e.g., motors, pumps). The flexible conduit absorbs the vibration, preventing stress and potential damage to rigid conduit connections or the enclosed cables.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Navigating Difficult Routes/Offsets:</strong> Used for short runs where complex bends or offsets around obstacles would be difficult or impractical to achieve with rigid conduit bending techniques. Offers easier routing in tight or awkward spaces.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Temporary Installations:</strong> Sometimes used in temporary setups where ease of installation and removal is beneficial.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Two Merits of Busbar Trunking over Conduit System:**</p>
                                <p>(See Answer to Q1(d)(ii) in 2016j paper).</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Flexibility for Tap-offs:</strong> Allows electrical loads (via distribution boards) to be easily connected at various points along the run using dedicated tap-off units without needing extensive modifications to the main run, ideal for changing layouts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Current Capacity (Often):</strong> Busbar systems are designed to carry high currents efficiently with low voltage drop compared to running multiple large cables in parallel conduits.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Faster Installation (Potentially):</strong> For distributing high power over long distances with multiple connection points, installing prefabricated busbar sections can be faster than installing equivalent capacity using multiple large conduits and cables.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Space (Potentially):</strong> Can sometimes occupy less space than multiple large conduits needed for the same power capacity.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="key-point">The question asked for two.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Copper offers high conductivity for cables, while specialized rubbers provide flexibility. MIMS cable excels in fire resistance and durability. Wiring system choice balances cost, safety, and other factors. Flexible conduit aids connection to vibrating equipment. Busbar trunking offers flexible, high-capacity power distribution, advantageous over conduit in certain applications.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Radial Circuit:</strong> Cable runs from the consumer unit (CU) protection device outwards to supply one or more points (sockets/appliances) in a line or branch, ending at the last point.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ring Circuit (Ring Final Circuit):</strong> Cable runs from the CU protection device, loops through multiple socket outlets, and returns back to the *same* protection device terminals in the CU, forming a closed ring.</li>

 Procedure:
 1. Isolate supply safely.
 2. Connect one lead of low-R ohmmeter to MET at CU.
 3. Connect other lead (long wander lead) to the Earth pin hole of the socket outlet.
 4. Measure resistance (R2 value).
 Expected Reading: Very low resistance (typically < 0.5 Ohms, depending on cable length/size).
    A high reading or open circuit indicates a fault in the CPC.
    Similar tests done for Line (R1) and Neutral (Rn) continuity if needed.

                                    <p>The voltage drop across the variable resistor must be the difference between the supply voltage and the total battery back EMF:</p>

                                    <p>R<sub>variable</sub> = 18.6 V / 4 A = <strong>4.65 Ω</strong></p>
                                    <p>The variable resistor should be set to <strong>4.65 Ohms</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>(See Answer to Q3(a)(i) in 2016j paper). An electric shock is the dangerous physiological effect caused by electric current passing through the body. From a safety perspective, it's a primary hazard associated with electricity. Contact with live parts can cause current to flow through the body to earth or between live conductors, leading to effects ranging from muscle spasms and burns to respiratory arrest and fatal cardiac fibrillation. Safety measures like insulation, earthing, isolation, and using RCDs are designed to prevent or mitigate the risk of electric shock.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Regulations Governing Solar PV Technicians Licensing in Kenya</strong></p>
                                    <p>Licensing is primarily governed by the **Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA)** under the **Energy Act, 2019** and associated regulations:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>The Energy (Solar Photovoltaic Systems) Regulations:** These regulations specify the standards for solar PV components and systems, and outline the requirements for licensing of solar PV technicians and contractors. They define different classes of licenses (e.g., T1, T2, T3 for technicians) based on competency and the scale/type of systems they are authorized to install.</li>
                                        <li><strong>EPRA Licensing Requirements:** EPRA sets the specific criteria for obtaining a solar PV technician license, which typically include proof of relevant technical training (from accredited institutions), practical experience, assessment/examination, and adherence to safety and installation standards. Application procedures and fees are managed by EPRA.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** Simpler, less expensive type that connects the PV array directly to the battery during bulk charge and then uses rapid ON/OFF switching (PWM) to regulate the voltage during absorption phase. Most efficient when PV array nominal voltage closely matches battery voltage.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT):** More advanced and efficient type. It decouples the array voltage from the battery voltage, allowing the array to operate at its Maximum Power Point (MPP) voltage (which varies with conditions). It then converts the power electronically to the required battery charging voltage. Significantly more efficient than PWM, especially with higher voltage arrays, in colder temperatures, or when battery SoC is low.</li>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Site Survey & Planning:</strong> Assess roof suitability (space, orientation, tilt, shading, structure), confirm load requirements, finalize system design (component sizing, layout). Obtain necessary permits.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mounting System Installation:</strong> Securely install the roof anchors/fixings and mounting rails according to manufacturer instructions and structural requirements, ensuring waterproofing.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Module Mounting & Earthing:</strong> Mount the PV modules onto the rails, ensuring correct orientation and secure clamping. Install bonding jumpers between module frames and connect the array framework to the installation earth (CPC).</li>
                                        <li><strong>DC Wiring (Array):</strong> Interconnect modules within strings (using MC4 connectors) and run string cables (appropriately sized DC solar cable) down from the roof to the DC isolator/combiner box location, usually via conduit for protection. Ensure correct polarity.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Install Indoors Components:</strong> Mount the DC isolator(s), charge controller, battery bank (in suitable ventilated, secure location), inverter (if AC system), DC/AC distribution boxes/consumer units.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Component Interconnection:</strong> Wire components together according to the system diagram: Array -> DC Isolator -> Controller PV Input -> Controller Battery Output -> Battery Isolator -> Battery Bank. Connect Controller Load Output -> DC Distribution/Loads. Connect Battery -> Inverter DC Input (via Isolator/Fuse). Connect Inverter AC Output -> AC Distribution. Ensure all connections are correct polarity and torqued appropriately.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Earthing & Bonding Completion:</strong> Ensure all metallic components (controller case, inverter case, etc.) are correctly earthed via CPCs run back to the MET.</li>
                                        <li><strong>System Checks (Pre-Commissioning):</strong> Perform dead tests: verify continuity of all conductors (especially CPCs), check polarity throughout DC side, measure insulation resistance of array and DC wiring.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Commissioning:</strong> Systematically energize the system: connect array to controller, connect controller to battery, check charging operation. Connect loads/inverter and verify correct function. Measure operating voltages/currents (Voc, Isc, charge current, load current) and record results.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Handover & Documentation:</strong> Provide the client with all manuals, warranties, test certificates, and explain system operation and basic maintenance.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">PV technician licensing in Kenya is regulated by EPRA under the Energy Act. Cell output depends on irradiance and temperature. Solar cells use a P-N junction to convert light to electricity. Charge controllers (PWM/MPPT) protect batteries. PV system installation involves careful planning, mounting, wiring, component interconnection, testing, and commissioning.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(c) PV Solar Sizing Terms Explanation</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily System Energy Requirement:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q8(c)(i) in 2019j paper). The total daily energy (Wh) the source (PV/battery) must supply to cover load demand PLUS system losses.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Voltage Drop:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q8(c)(ii) in 2021n paper). The reduction in voltage along a cable due to its resistance (V=IR). Critical to minimize in low-voltage PV systems to avoid power loss and ensure component function.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Load Demand and PV Module Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p>Loads:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lamp: 1 x 8W x 4h = 32 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>Refrigerator: 1 x 60W x 24h = 1440 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>TV: 1 x 40W x 3h = 120 Wh/day</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily Load Demand (Energy):**</p>
                                    <p>Total Load Energy = 32 Wh + 1440 Wh + 120 Wh = <strong>1592 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>(ii) Number of PV Modules Required:**</p>
                                    <p>Given: PV Module Generation Factor = 3.4 (Wh/day per Wp rating)</p>
                                    <p>N.B. Neglect system losses.</p>
                                    <p>Required PV Array Watt-peak (Wp) = Total Daily Load Demand (Wh/day) / Generation Factor (Wh/day/Wp)</p>
                                    <p>Required Wp = 1592 Wh/day / 3.4 Wh/day/Wp</p>
                                    <p>Required Wp ≈ <strong>468.2 Wp</strong></p>
                                    <p>Number of modules depends on the chosen module Wp rating. E.g., if using 150Wp modules:</p>
                                    <p>Number = 468.2 / 150 ≈ 3.12 => **4 modules** are needed.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Regular battery maintenance and adherence to installation regulations are crucial. System failures often stem from wiring, battery state, or faulty components. PV system sizing involves calculating energy needs considering factors like voltage drop, while the generation factor helps estimate required panel wattage.</p>
