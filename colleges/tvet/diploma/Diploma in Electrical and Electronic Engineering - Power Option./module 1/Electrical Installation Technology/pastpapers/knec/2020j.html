                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Isolation and Lockout/Tagout:</strong> Always isolate the equipment from the power supply before starting work. Use appropriate isolators/breakers and apply locks and tags (LOTO) to prevent accidental re-energization.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Test Before Touch:</strong> Use an approved voltage indicator or multimeter (checked on a known live source first) to confirm that the circuit or equipment is truly dead before touching any conductors or terminals.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use Insulated Tools and PPE:</strong> Employ tools with appropriate insulation ratings (e.g., VDE certified) and wear suitable Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as insulating gloves, eye protection, and safety footwear.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Maintain Safe Working Area:</strong> Keep the work area clear, dry, and well-lit. Avoid distractions and ensure secure footing. Use insulating mats where necessary.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inspect Equipment Regularly:</strong> Check electrical equipment, cords, and plugs for damage (frayed wires, cracked insulation, bent pins) before use. Do not use damaged equipment.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Class A:</strong> Fires involving solid organic materials like wood, paper, textiles, and plastics. (Example: Burning waste paper bin).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Class B:</strong> Fires involving flammable liquids or liquefiable solids like petrol, oil, paint, fats, and waxes. (Example: Spilled petrol igniting).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Class C:</strong> Fires involving flammable gases like natural gas (methane), LPG (propane, butane), hydrogen, and acetylene. (Example: Leaking gas cylinder catching fire).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Class D:</strong> Fires involving combustible metals like magnesium, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. Require special dry powder extinguishers. (Example: Magnesium shavings burning).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Class F (or K in US):</strong> Fires involving cooking oils and fats in deep fat fryers. Require special wet chemical extinguishers. (Example: Chip pan fire).</li>
                                    <li><em>Electrical Fires (Formerly Class E):</em> Not a distinct class anymore, but refers to fires involving live electrical equipment. The electricity must be isolated first, then an appropriate extinguisher (COâ‚‚, Dry Powder) used.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Constant Voltage Charging and Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Constant Voltage Charging Method:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q3(b) in 2016n paper for diagram and explanation).</p>
                                    <p>In this method, a fixed voltage is applied across the battery terminals. The charging current is initially high (if the battery is discharged) and automatically decreases (tapers) as the battery's voltage rises towards the charger's set voltage. It's often used for the absorption and float stages of charging.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Charging Resistor Calculation:**</p>
                                    <p>Given:</p>

                                        <li>Terminal voltage per cell (V<sub>cell</sub>) = 2 V (Assume this is the effective back EMF during charge)</li>
                                        <li>Total battery voltage (V<sub>batt_total</sub>) = 6 cells * 2 V/cell = 12 V</li>
                                        <li>Supply Voltage (V<sub>supply</sub>) = 20 V</li>
                                        <li>Desired Charging Current (I<sub>charge</sub>) = 5 A</li>
                                        <li>Let R<sub>series</sub> be the required series resistance.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The voltage drop across the series resistor must be the difference between the supply voltage and the total battery voltage:</p>
                                    <p>V<sub>resistor</sub> = V<sub>supply</sub> - V<sub>batt_total</sub> = 20 V - 12 V = 8 V</p>
                                    <p>Using Ohm's Law (V = I * R) for the resistor:</p>
                                    <p>V<sub>resistor</sub> = I<sub>charge</sub> * R<sub>series</sub></p>
                                    <p>8 V = 5 A * R<sub>series</sub></p>
                                    <p>R<sub>series</sub> = 8 V / 5 A = <strong>1.6 Î©</strong></p>

                                    <p>In summary: When armed, a continuous low-voltage circuit runs through normally closed sensors. If a sensor opens (e.g., door contact breaks) or the wire is cut, the circuit breaks, de-energizing a control relay. The relay contacts then close the separate high-power siren/bell circuit, activating the alarm. Offers tamper detection.</p>

                                    <p>To operate independently means pressing either A OR B will ring the bell. This requires connecting the push buttons in **parallel**.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Faulty/Loose Connections:</strong> High resistance at poor connections generates localized heat, leading to fire.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Short Circuits/Earth Faults:</strong> Cause very high currents which can create intense heat and arcing, igniting materials.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Achieving Earthing and Exemptions</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) How Earthing is Achieved:**</p>
                                    <p>Earthing involves creating a deliberate, low-impedance connection between specific parts of an electrical installation and the general mass of earth. This is achieved by:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Connecting all exposed-conductive-parts (metal casings of Class I equipment) via Circuit Protective Conductors (CPCs) back to a central point.</li>
                                        <li>Connecting all extraneous-conductive-parts (metal pipes, structural steelwork) via Main Protective Bonding conductors back to the same central point.</li>
                                        <li>This central point is the Main Earthing Terminal (MET).</li>
                                        <li>Connecting the MET via an Earthing Conductor (Earth Lead) to the Means of Earthing (either the earth electrode system installed by the consumer, e.g., rods driven into the ground for a TT system, or the earth terminal provided by the electricity supplier for TN-S or TN-C-S systems).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>This complete system ensures that under fault conditions, dangerous voltages do not persist on accessible metalwork.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Two Parts Exempted from Earthing:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q5(c)(ii) in 2016n paper for more examples).</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Small isolated metal parts (screws, nameplates) unlikely to become live or be touched simultaneously with live/earthed parts.</li>
                                        <li>Class II (Double Insulated) equipment (marked with concentric squares).</li>
                                        <li>Equipment supplied by a SELV system.</li>
                                        <li>Short lengths of metal conduit used purely for mechanical protection.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(i) Type of Circuit Breaker:**</p>
                                    <p>Based on the typical appearance with a core balance transformer visible internally, this is a **Current Operated Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB)**, more commonly known today as a **Residual Current Device (RCD)**.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Identification of Labelled Parts:**</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>X:</strong> Test Button - Used to manually trip the device to verify its mechanical operation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Y:</strong> Sensing Coil / Core Balance Transformer (CBT) - The toroidal transformer through which the line and neutral conductors pass; detects current imbalance.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Z:</strong> Trip Mechanism / Relay - The sensitive mechanism activated by the sensing coil voltage imbalance, which physically opens the main contacts.</li>
                                        <li><strong>W:</strong> Main Contacts - The switch contacts within the Line and Neutral paths that open to disconnect the circuit when the device trips.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Electrical fires often result from overloading or faults. Cartridge fuses offer reliable high-current interruption. Earthing provides safety by creating a path for fault current, though some parts are exempt. RCDs detect earth leakage currents via a core balance transformer to rapidly disconnect the supply.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Structured Cabling System Elements</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Entrance Facilities (EF):**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q5(d)(ii) in 2019j paper for details).</p>
                                    <p>This is the point where external telecommunication service provider cables enter the building and connect to the internal backbone cabling. It includes the physical entry point, termination hardware (connecting blocks/panels), protection devices (surge protectors), the grounding interface (TGB), and the demarcation point between the provider and building owner networks.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Horizontal Cabling:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q2(c) in 2015j paper for details).</p>
                                    <p>This subsystem runs from the telecommunications room (TR) or horizontal cross-connect (HC) on a floor out to the individual work area outlets (WAOs). It includes the horizontal cables (e.g., Cat6), the patch panels in the TR/HC, and the outlets/sockets at the work area. It typically follows a star topology.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Prepare the Cord:</strong> Carefully cut the outer sheath of the flexible cord back (e.g., 30-40mm) without damaging the insulation of the inner cores (Live, Neutral, Earth).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Strip Inner Cores:</strong> Strip a small amount of insulation (e.g., 5-7mm) from the end of each inner core (Brown - Live, Blue - Neutral, Green/Yellow - Earth), exposing the conductor strands. Twist the strands tightly for each core.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Open the Plug:</strong> Unscrew and remove the plug cover. Loosen the screws on the three terminal pins (Live, Neutral, Earth) and the cord grip screw(s).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fit the Cord:</strong> Pass the prepared cord through the plug's cord grip.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Connect Cores to Pins:</strong>
                                            <ul><li>Connect the **Green/Yellow** (Earth) core to the longest, top pin (Earth terminal - E). Ensure all strands are under the screw/clamp. Tighten securely.</li>
                                                <li>Connect the **Blue** (Neutral) core to the left-hand pin (Neutral terminal - N). Tighten securely.</li>
                                                <li>Connect the **Brown** (Live) core to the right-hand pin (Live terminal - L), which also houses the fuse. Tighten securely.</li></ul>
                                             Ensure no stray strands are bridging terminals and no bare conductor is visible outside the terminal. The insulation should reach close to the terminal.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Secure Cord Grip:</strong> Arrange the cores neatly within the plug body. Position the cord so the outer sheath is firmly held by the cord grip. Tighten the cord grip screw(s) securely onto the outer sheath (NOT the inner cores) to prevent strain on the terminal connections if the cord is pulled.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Fuse:</strong> Ensure the correct rated fuse (e.g., 3A, 5A, 13A, appropriate for the appliance) is fitted in the Live pin holder.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Replace Cover:</strong> Refit the plug cover and tighten the fixing screw(s). Check the plug is secure and neat.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li><strong>B:</strong> Armour (Galvanized Steel Wires - SWA)</li>
                                        <li><strong>C:</strong> Bedding (material between inner sheath/cores and armour, e.g., PVC, LSF)</li>
                                        <li><strong>D:</strong> Inner Insulation (around individual conductors, typically PVC or XLPE) - Assuming D points to the insulation of one core. If it points to the conductor itself, it's the Conductor. If it points to the sheath covering the cores but under the bedding, it's the Inner Sheath.

                                    <p class="answer-intro">This answer explains the photoelectric effect (and clarifies its relation to PV), lists factors affecting PV output, illustrates module earthing, describes mono- and polycrystalline construction, and diagrams a hybrid AC/DC solar system.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Photoelectric Effect and PV Output Factors</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Photoelectric Effect:**</p>
                                    <p>The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material (typically a metal surface) when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, shines on it. For emission to occur, the photons of the incident light must have an energy greater than the material's 'work function' (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface). The number of electrons emitted is proportional to the light intensity, and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons depends on the light frequency.</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">While related (involving photon-electron interaction), the primary principle of solar cell operation is the **Photovoltaic Effect**, which generates a voltage within the semiconductor material itself, rather than electron emission *from* the surface.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Four Factors Affecting PV Solar Module Output:**</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Solar Irradiance (Sunlight Intensity):</strong> Higher intensity = higher current output = higher power.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cell Temperature:</strong> Higher temperature = lower voltage = lower power.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Shading:</strong> Partial shading significantly reduces output of module/string.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Load / Operating Point:</strong> Output power depends on the connected load; maximum power is delivered only at the MPP.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(i) Angle of Incidence:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q8(a)(ii) in 2016j paper). The angle between the sun's rays and the line perpendicular (normal) to the receiving surface. A smaller angle (closer to 0Â°) means more direct sunlight and higher energy intensity on the surface.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Diffuse Radiation:**</p>
                                    <p>Solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface after being scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules, aerosols, or clouds in the atmosphere. It comes from all parts of the sky, not just directly from the sun's disc. Flat plate collectors and PV panels can utilize both direct and diffuse radiation, while concentrating collectors primarily use only direct radiation.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Solar Concentrators</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) How Solar Concentrators Harvest Energy:**</p>
                                    <p>Solar concentrators use reflective surfaces (mirrors) or refractive elements (lenses) to gather solar radiation over a large aperture area and focus it onto a much smaller receiver area. This increases the solar flux density (W/mÂ²) significantly, allowing much higher temperatures to be achieved at the receiver compared to non-concentrating collectors. The heat absorbed by the receiver is then transferred to a working fluid or used directly.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Three Types of Solar Energy Concentrators:**</p>

                                        <li><strong>Parabolic Trough Collectors:</strong> Long, U-shaped mirrors focus sunlight onto a receiver tube running along the focal line.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Parabolic Dish Collectors:</strong> Dish-shaped mirrors focus sunlight onto a point receiver at the focal point.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Power Tower (Central Receiver) Systems:</strong> A large field of computer-controlled mirrors (heliostats) track the sun and reflect sunlight onto a central receiver mounted on top of a tower.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Linear Fresnel Reflectors:</strong> Use long, flat or slightly curved mirror strips to approximate a parabolic trough, reflecting light onto an elevated receiver.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Thermo-siphon Water Heating System (Figure 6)</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Identification of Parts:**</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>A:</strong> Cold Water Inlet (to the collector or storage tank, depending on exact layout shown - typically to bottom of collector or tank).</li>
                                        <li><strong>B:</strong> Solar Collector Panel (Flat Plate or Evacuated Tube type) - Absorbs solar energy.</li>
                                        <li><strong>C:</strong> Hot Water Outlet (from the collector to the storage tank, or from the tank to the point of use - typically from top of collector to top of tank).</li>
                                        <li><em>(Other key parts not labelled might include: Storage Tank, Connecting Pipes, Mounting Frame).</em></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) How Part B (Solar Collector Panel) Operates:**</p>
                                    <p>The solar collector panel (B) is designed to absorb incoming solar radiation and transfer that heat energy to the water (or heat transfer fluid) flowing through it. Sunlight passes through the transparent glazing (if present) and strikes the dark absorber plate inside. The absorber plate heats up significantly. This heat is conducted to the fluid flowing within tubes (risers) attached to the absorber. As the fluid heats up, its density decreases, causing it to naturally rise (thermosiphon effect) through the collector and up into the insulated storage tank located *above* the collector. Cooler, denser water from the bottom of the tank flows down into the bottom of the collector to replace the rising hot water, creating a natural circulation loop driven purely by density differences (temperature differences) without needing a pump.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Angle of incidence affects energy intensity, while diffuse radiation is scattered sunlight. Solar energy is converted mainly to heat or electricity for various applications. Concentrators use optics to achieve high temperatures. Thermosiphon systems utilize natural convection driven by solar heating in the collector panel to circulate water.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Procedure of Planning and Designing a Domestic Solar-Electric (PV) System</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Load Assessment:</strong> Identify all electrical appliances (loads) to be powered. Determine their power rating (Watts) and estimate their daily usage duration (hours/day). Calculate the total daily energy demand (Watt-hours/day).</li>
                                        <li><strong>System Type Selection:</strong> Decide if the system will be off-grid (standalone), grid-tied (feeding excess to grid), or hybrid (grid-tied with battery backup). Determine the required system voltage (e.g., 12V, 24V, 48V for off-grid DC).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Site Assessment:</strong> Evaluate the installation site (usually rooftop) for available unshaded area, orientation (towards equator), tilt angle possibilities, structural integrity, and cable routing options.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insolation Data:</strong> Obtain average daily solar insolation data (Peak Sun Hours or kWh/mÂ²/day) for the location, ideally month-by-month, focusing on the least sunny period ('design month').</li>
                                        <li><strong>PV Array Sizing:</strong> Calculate the required total Watt-peak (Wp) rating of the PV array needed to generate the total daily system energy requirement (Load Energy + System Losses) based on the available insolation during the design month. Select appropriate modules based on power, efficiency, size, cost, warranty. Determine series/parallel configuration for desired voltage/current.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Battery Sizing (Off-grid/Hybrid):</strong> Calculate the required battery bank capacity (Ampere-hours, Ah) based on the daily system energy requirement, desired days of autonomy (storage for sunless days), maximum allowable depth of discharge (DoD), system voltage, and battery efficiency. Select appropriate battery type (flooded, AGM, Gel, Lithium).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Charge Controller Sizing:</strong> Select a charge controller (PWM or MPPT) with voltage and current ratings (PV input Voc/Isc, battery voltage, charging current) exceeding the array/battery specifications, including safety margins.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inverter Sizing (if AC loads):</strong> Select an inverter with appropriate continuous and surge power ratings for the AC loads, matching DC input voltage to the battery bank, and providing the correct AC output voltage/frequency/waveform.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Component Selection & Balance of System (BOS):</strong> Choose appropriate mounting structures, cables (sized for current and voltage drop), DC/AC isolators, fuses/breakers, combiner boxes, monitoring systems, and other necessary hardware.</li>
                                        <li><strong>System Diagram & Documentation:</strong> Create a detailed wiring diagram (schematic) and installation plan. Document all component choices and calculations.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p><strong>(b) PV Solar Installation Design Terms</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily Energy Demand:**</p>
                                    <p>The sum total of electrical energy (measured in Watt-hours, Wh) consumed by all the individual electrical appliances (loads) connected to the solar installation over a typical 24-hour period. It's calculated by multiplying the power rating (W) of each appliance by its estimated daily operating time (h) and summing these values for all appliances.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Days of Autonomy:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q8(c)(ii) in 2019j paper). The number of consecutive days the system's battery bank is expected to supply the normal daily load energy requirements without receiving any charge from the PV array (due to prolonged bad weather). It's a key factor in sizing batteries for off-grid system reliability.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Procedure for Topping Up Electrolyte (Flooded Lead-Acid Battery)</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Wear appropriate PPE (eye protection, acid-resistant gloves). Ensure good ventilation and no ignition sources nearby.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Charge State:</strong> Ideally, top up *after* the battery has been fully charged, as the electrolyte level rises during charging. If topping up a discharged battery, leave some space for expansion.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Clean Battery Top:</strong> Clean any dirt or corrosion from the battery top and around the vent caps to prevent contaminants from falling into the cells.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Remove Vent Caps:</strong> Carefully unscrew or pry off the vent caps or manifold cover.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inspect Level:</strong> Look inside each cell. The electrolyte level should cover the tops of the internal plates, typically reaching the bottom of the vent well or an indicator mark.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Add Distilled Water:</strong> If the level is low, slowly add **only distilled or deionized water** using a clean funnel or battery filler bottle until the correct level is reached. **Never add acid.**</li>
                                        <li><strong>Avoid Overfilling:</strong> Do not fill right to the top of the vent well; leave appropriate space for expansion during charging and temperature changes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Replace Vent Caps:</strong> Securely replace the vent caps or manifold cover.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Clean Up:</strong> Wipe away any spilled water.</li>

                                     <p class="key-point">The question asked for three.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Planning a PV system involves careful assessment of loads, site conditions, and available sunlight, followed by sizing of array, battery, and control gear. Autonomy dictates storage capacity. Battery maintenance, including correct watering, is vital. Troubleshooting faults requires systematically checking components from source (PV) through controls to storage (battery) and loads.</p>
