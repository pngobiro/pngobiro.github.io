                                <p class="answer-intro">This answer explains the reasons for earthing, outlines earthing methods (systems), defines protection terms, and diagrams a cartridge fuse.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Three Reasons for Earthing an Electrical Installation</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Protection Against Electric Shock (Safety):</strong> This is the primary reason. Earthing provides a path of low impedance for fault current to flow to ground if exposed metalwork becomes live due to an insulation failure. This large current operates the protective device (fuse/MCB/RCD) quickly, disconnecting the supply and preventing the metalwork from remaining at a dangerous voltage relative to earth.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Voltage Stabilization and Reference:</strong> Earthing helps to stabilize the voltage of the electrical system with respect to the general mass of earth, preventing excessive voltage build-up due to faults, lightning, or static electricity. It provides a common reference potential for the system.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Protection Against Overvoltage:</strong> It provides a path for surge currents (e.g., from lightning strikes on or near the supply network) to dissipate safely into the earth, reducing the risk of damage to the installation and connected equipment.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Four Methods Used to Achieve Earthing (Earthing Systems)</strong></p>
                                <p>These describe how the installation's earthing is connected relative to the supply source's earthing:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>TN-S (Terra Neutral - Separated):</strong> The supply transformer neutral is earthed. The supplier provides separate Neutral (N) and Protective Earth (PE) conductors all the way to the consumer's premises. The consumer connects their Main Earthing Terminal (MET) to the supplied PE conductor.</li>
                                    <li><strong>TN-C-S (Terra Neutral - Combined Separated / PME):</strong> The supply transformer neutral is earthed. The supplier combines Neutral and Protective Earth functions in a single PEN conductor in the distribution network, which is earthed at multiple points. At the consumer's intake, the PEN is split into separate N and PE terminals. The consumer connects their MET to the supplied PE terminal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>TT (Terra Terra):</strong> The supply transformer neutral is earthed. The consumer provides their *own* independent earth connection using an earth electrode (rod, plate, etc.) connected to their MET. The supplier does not provide an earth connection.</li>
                                    <li><strong>IT (Isolé Terra):</strong> The supply source is either unearthed (isolated from earth) or earthed through a high impedance. The installation's exposed-conductive-parts are earthed via their own electrode(s). Used in specialized applications requiring high supply continuity (e.g., hospitals, mines).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(c) Definitions in Electrical Protection</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Current Rating (of a protective device or cable):</strong>
                                    <ul><li><em>For a Fuse/Circuit Breaker:</em> The designated current (In) that the device is designed to carry continuously under specified conditions without tripping or blowing.</li>
                                        <li><em>For a Cable:</em> The maximum current (Iz) that the cable can carry continuously under specified installation conditions (ambient temperature, grouping, installation method) without exceeding its maximum permitted operating temperature.</li></ul></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Discrimination (Selectivity):</strong> The ability of a protection system with multiple protective devices in series to ensure that, under fault conditions, only the device closest to the fault on the load side operates, leaving the upstream devices unaffected. This prevents unnecessary disconnection of healthy parts of the installation.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Earthing is crucial for safety against electric shock and overvoltage. Different earthing systems (TN-S, TN-C-S, TT, IT) define the connection method. Current rating and discrimination are key concepts in designing effective electrical protection using devices like cartridge fuses.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Workshop Tools: Function and Storage</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Hacksaw:</strong>
                                        <ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> Used for cutting metal objects like conduit, trunking, bolts, or metal stock. Consists of a frame holding a replaceable, fine-toothed blade under tension.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store with the blade tension released slightly (if adjustable frame) to prevent stress. Store in a designated rack or drawer, often with blade teeth protected or facing away from easy contact. Keep blades clean and dry to prevent rust.</li></ul></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Soldering Bit (Soldering Iron Tip):</strong>
                                        <ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> The heated metal tip of a soldering iron that transfers heat to the components and melts the solder to create an electrical joint. Different shapes and sizes are available for various tasks.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> After use, clean the bit while hot on a damp sponge and apply a small amount of fresh solder (tinning) to prevent oxidation. Store the soldering iron securely in its stand to prevent burns or fire hazards. Allow to cool completely before storing in a drawer or box.</li></ul></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(iii) Centre Punch:</strong>
                                        <ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> Used to make a small indentation (dimple) in metal or other materials before drilling. This indentation guides the tip of the drill bit, preventing it from wandering when starting the hole.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store with the pointed tip protected (e.g., in a tool roll, partitioned drawer, or with a cap if provided) to prevent damage to the point and accidental injury. Keep clean and dry.</li></ul></p>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Battery Charging Methods</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Trickle Charging:</strong> A method of charging a battery at a very low, continuous current rate (typically a small fraction of its Ah capacity, e.g., C/50 or C/100). It is used to maintain a fully charged battery, compensating for its natural self-discharge over long periods of inactivity (e.g., maintaining a car battery during winter storage) without significantly overcharging it.</li>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Constant Current (CC) Charging:</strong> Charging the battery with a fixed, predetermined current value. The battery voltage increases as it charges. This method is often used for the initial 'bulk' charging phase but requires careful monitoring or control circuitry to prevent overvoltage and overcharging as the battery approaches full capacity. The current level is usually chosen based on the battery capacity (e.g., C/10 rate).</p>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Charging Current Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p>Given:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Supply Voltage (V<sub>Supply</sub>) = 14 V</li>
                                        <li>Battery Terminal Voltage (V<sub>Batt</sub>) = 12 V (This is likely the nominal voltage or voltage under some condition, but for charging, we consider its back EMF)</li>
                                        <li>Battery Internal Resistance (R<sub>int</sub>) = 0.25 Ω</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>When charging, the supply voltage must overcome the battery's back EMF (which opposes the charging current, approximately equal to its open-circuit voltage, let's use V<sub>Batt</sub> as given) and the voltage drop across its internal resistance.</p>
                                    <p>The effective voltage driving the charging current (I<sub>Charge</sub>) is V<sub>Supply</sub> - V<sub>Batt</sub>.</p>
                                    <p>Using Ohm's Law for the circuit: V<sub>Effective</sub> = I<sub>Charge</sub> * R<sub>Total</sub></p>
                                    <p>Here, R<sub>Total</sub> is primarily the battery's internal resistance (assuming charger/wiring resistance is negligible).</p>
                                    <p>V<sub>Supply</sub> - V<sub>Batt</sub> = I<sub>Charge</sub> * R<sub>int</sub></p>
                                    <p>14 V - 12 V = I<sub>Charge</sub> * 0.25 Ω</p>
                                    <p>2 V = I<sub>Charge</sub> * 0.25 Ω</p>
                                    <p>I<sub>Charge</sub> = 2 V / 0.25 Ω</p>
                                    <p>I<sub>Charge</sub> = <strong>8 A</strong></p>
                                    <p>The charging current is <strong>8 Amperes</strong>.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Workshop safety requires diligence regarding housekeeping, tool use, PPE, and electrical practices. Following fire procedures like RACE is critical. Proper tool storage maintains condition and safety. Trickle charging maintains charge, while constant current charging provides bulk charge. Basic circuit analysis allows calculation of charging currents.</p>

Each device should be clearly labelled to indicate the circuit or equipment it controls. (Ref: Regulation 514.1, 537.2.8, 537.3.7).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Isolation Provision:</strong> Every installation must have means of isolation to disconnect all or part of it from the supply for safety during maintenance. Isolators must disconnect all live conductors (line and neutral, where appropriate) and provide secure isolation (e.g., lockable). (Ref: Regulation Group 537.2).</li>

                                        <li><strong>Proximity to Load Centre:</strong> Diesel stations are often used for backup or in remote areas. Siting close to the load reduces transmission/distribution line lengths and losses, improving voltage regulation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fuel Supply Access:</strong> Requires reliable and economic delivery of large quantities of diesel fuel. Proximity to road, rail, or port facilities for fuel transport and adequate space for fuel storage tanks are essential.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Environmental Considerations:</strong> Noise pollution from engines and exhaust emissions (NOx, SOx, particulates) must be considered. Site should be located away from densely populated residential areas, considering prevailing wind directions and local environmental regulations regarding noise and air quality. Cooling water availability might also be a factor for larger stations.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Foundation Suitability:</strong> Ground must be stable enough to support the heavy diesel engines, generators, and associated equipment without excessive vibration transmission.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Accessibility and Enclosure:</strong> Joints/terminations must generally be accessible for inspection/testing/maintenance and enclosed in suitable accessories (boxes, equipment). (Reg 526.3, 526.5).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Electrical Continuity and Mechanical Strength:</strong> Must provide durable electrical continuity and adequate mechanical strength/protection. (Reg 526.1, 526.2).</li>

                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Soldering Definition:</strong> Soldering is a process of joining metal parts (like electrical conductors) using a filler metal alloy (solder) which has a lower melting point than the parts being joined. Heat is applied to the parts, and the solder is melted, flowing into the joint by capillary action. Upon cooling, the solder solidifies, creating a permanent electrical and mechanical bond between the parts.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Adequate Tensioning & Support:</strong> Ensure the catenary support wire is correctly tensioned according to manufacturer's specifications or engineering calculations to minimize sag but avoid overstressing the wire or anchor points. Anchor points must be structurally sound.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Correct Hangers/Clips:</strong> Use appropriate hangers or clips compatible with both the catenary wire and the cables being supported, spaced correctly to prevent excessive cable sag between supports.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cable Protection:</strong> Ensure cables are not damaged during installation or by rubbing against the catenary wire or hangers. Use protective saddles if necessary. Maintain adequate clearance from moving objects (cranes, doors).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Earthing:</strong> The metallic catenary support wire itself must be effectively earthed/bonded according to regulations, as it could become live under fault conditions if cable insulation fails.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Weight Loading:</strong> Ensure the catenary wire and supports are rated for the total weight of the cables being suspended over the span.</li>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Joints and terminations must be accessible, strong, and electrically sound. Soldering creates fused joints, while Britannia and Bell Hanger's are specific (though less common power) types. Catenary wiring requires careful tensioning and earthing. Earth concentric cables combine conductors layer-wise. Busbar rising mains provide efficient vertical power distribution in tall buildings using enclosed busbars and tap-off units.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Solar Collectors: Function and Types</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Function of a Solar Collector:</strong> The primary function of a solar collector is to intercept incident solar radiation (sunlight) and convert it into a usable form of energy, typically thermal energy (heat) transferred to a working fluid (like water or air), or directly into electrical energy (in the case of photovoltaic collectors).</p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Three Types of Solar Energy Collectors:</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Flat Plate Collectors:</strong> Absorb direct and diffuse radiation to heat a fluid (water/air) using a dark absorber plate under glazing. Common for domestic water/space heating.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Evacuated Tube Collectors:</strong> Use vacuum insulation around absorber tubes to reduce heat loss, achieving higher temperatures/efficiencies than flat plates, especially in cold weather. Used for water heating and process heat.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Concentrating Collectors:</strong> Use mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a smaller receiver area, achieving high temperatures. Examples include Parabolic Troughs, Parabolic Dishes, and Power Towers, used mainly for industrial heat or electricity generation (CSP).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Photovoltaic (PV) Modules:</strong> Convert sunlight directly into DC electricity. While primarily electrical, they are collectors of solar radiation.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p class="key-point">The question asked for three.</p>


                                    <p><strong>(b) Solar Concentrating Type Cookers (Parabolic Cooker Example)</strong></p>
                                    <p>These cookers use reflective surfaces to concentrate sunlight onto a cooking pot, generating high temperatures quickly.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Advantages and Disadvantages of Solar Electricity (PV)</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Two Advantages:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> Produces no greenhouse gas emissions or air/water pollution during operation, helping combat climate change and improve air quality.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Renewable & Sustainable:</strong> Uses sunlight, an inexhaustible energy source, unlike finite fossil fuels.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Low Operating Costs:</strong> No fuel costs after installation, and PV panels generally require minimal maintenance.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Energy Independence/Off-Grid Capability:</strong> Allows users to generate their own power, reducing reliance on utility grids, particularly beneficial in remote areas.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Two Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Intermittency & Weather Dependence:</strong> Power generation depends directly on sunlight availability; output varies with time of day, season, cloud cover, and weather conditions. Requires energy storage (batteries) for continuous supply.</li>
                                        <li><strong>High Initial Cost:</strong> The upfront cost of purchasing and installing a PV system (panels, inverter, batteries, mounting, etc.) can be significant compared to conventional energy sources, although costs have decreased considerably.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Land/Space Requirement:</strong> Utility-scale PV farms require large areas of land. Rooftop installations are limited by available, suitable roof space.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Energy Storage Costs/Complexity:</strong> For reliable off-grid or backup power, battery storage adds significant cost, complexity, and maintenance requirements to the system.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Operation of a Solar Cell</strong></p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q7(c) in 2016j paper for diagram and detailed explanation of the photovoltaic effect).</p>
                                    <p>In brief: Light (photons) striking the P-N junction semiconductor material creates electron-hole pairs. The junction's electric field separates these charges, creating a voltage. Connecting an external circuit allows DC current to flow.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Solar collectors capture solar energy for thermal or electrical use. Concentrating cookers use reflection to achieve high cooking temperatures. Solar electricity offers environmental benefits but faces challenges of intermittency and initial cost. Solar cells operate based on the photovoltaic effect.</p>

                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Consumer Unit (DC or AC):</strong> In a solar installation context, this refers to an enclosure containing protective devices (fuses or circuit breakers) for different load circuits originating from the solar system. There might be a DC consumer unit protecting DC circuits fed directly from the battery/controller, and/or an AC consumer unit protecting AC circuits fed from the inverter. It usually includes a main switch for isolating the circuits it controls.</p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Ceiling Roses:</strong> A wiring accessory used in lighting circuits, typically mounted on the ceiling. It provides a safe termination point for the fixed circuit wiring and a connection point for the flexible cord leading to a light fitting (luminaire). Allows easy replacement of the light fitting without disturbing the fixed wiring. (Function is the same as in conventional wiring).</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Service and Maintenance on PV Solar Module</strong></p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q6(c)(ii) in 2016j paper for details). Key procedures include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Regular removal of dirt, dust, bird droppings, etc., from the glass surface to maintain optimal light absorption.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong> Checking for physical damage (cracks, discoloration, delamination) to glass, frame, backsheet, and junction box.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Connection Checks:</strong> Inspecting wiring and connectors for tightness, corrosion, and damage.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mounting Check:</strong> Verifying the security and integrity of the mounting structure.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Shading Check:</strong> Assessing any new sources of shading (e.g., tree growth).</li>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Battery Service Needs and Safety Precautions</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Three Ways a Solar Battery Needs Service (Lead-Acid):</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Watering (Flooded Types):</strong> Electrolyte levels drop over time due to evaporation and gassing during charge. Regular checks and topping up with distilled water are needed to prevent plate exposure and damage.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cleaning Terminals/Connections:</strong> Corrosion can build up on terminals, increasing resistance and hindering performance. Regular cleaning and application of protective grease are required.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Equalization Charging (Flooded Types):</strong> Periodic controlled overcharge helps reverse mild sulfation, balance cell voltages, and mix electrolyte (prevent stratification), extending battery life. (Frequency depends on usage and manufacturer recommendation).</li>
                                        <li><strong>State of Charge Monitoring:</strong> Regularly checking voltage or specific gravity helps ensure the battery isn't being chronically undercharged or over-discharged, both of which shorten its life.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Safety Precautions When Handling Lead-Acid Batteries:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Wear appropriate PPE: Eye protection (goggles/face shield) and acid-resistant gloves are essential.</li>
                                        <li>Ensure good ventilation: Hydrogen gas produced during charging is explosive.</li>
                                        <li>No sparks or flames nearby: Keep ignition sources away from the battery area.</li>
                                        <li>Lift correctly: Batteries are heavy; use proper lifting techniques.</li>
                                        <li>Connect correctly: Ensure correct polarity (+ to +, - to -) when connecting chargers or loads.</li>
                                        <li>Handle electrolyte carefully: Avoid spills; neutralize any spills with baking soda.</li>
                                        <li>Use insulated tools when working on terminals.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Factors in PV System Sizing and Design</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Insolation:</strong> The amount of solar energy available at the specific installation location. It's typically measured in Peak Sun Hours (PSH) or kWh/m²/day. Accurate insolation data (often averaged monthly or annually for the location) is crucial for determining how much energy a PV array of a given size can be expected to generate, and therefore how large the array needs to be to meet the energy demand, especially during the least sunny periods.</li>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) System Losses:</strong> The reduction in energy delivered compared to the theoretical energy generated, due to inefficiencies and losses throughout the system. These include losses from:
                                        <ul><li>Temperature effects on panels (output drops as temp rises).</li>
                                            <li>Soiling (dirt on panels).</li>
                                            <li>Wiring resistance (voltage drop).</li>
                                            <li>Module mismatch.</li>
                                            <li>Charge controller inefficiency.</li>
                                            <li>Battery charge/discharge inefficiency (Coulombic efficiency).</li>
                                            <li>Inverter inefficiency (DC to AC conversion).</li></ul>
                                        Design calculations must oversize the generation (PV array) and storage (battery) components to compensate for these expected losses (often estimated as a total percentage, e.g., 15-30%) to ensure the required energy is actually delivered to the loads.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(d) System Requirements and Battery Capacity Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p>Given:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>System Voltage = 12 V DC</li>
                                        <li>Total Daily Energy Demand (Load Energy) = 1200 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>System Losses = 20% (Loss Fraction = 0.20)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Total Daily System Requirements (Energy from Source):</strong></p>
                                    <p>This is the energy the PV array must generate (or battery must supply) to cover both the load demand and the system losses.</p>
                                    <p>System Energy Req. = Load Energy / (1 - Loss Fraction)</p>
                                    <p>System Energy Req. = 1200 Wh / (1 - 0.20) = 1200 Wh / 0.80</p>
                                    <p>System Energy Req. = <strong>1500 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Battery Capacity in Ampere Hours (Basic Calculation - for one day, full discharge):</strong></p>
                                    <p>This calculation determines the Ah needed *just* to supply the daily *system* energy requirement. It does *not* account for autonomy (days without sun) or safe depth of discharge (DoD) limits, which are critical for actual battery sizing.</p>
                                    <p>Basic Ah Capacity = System Energy Req. (Wh) / System Voltage (V)</p>
                                    <p>Basic Ah Capacity = 1500 Wh / 12 V</p>
                                    <p>Basic Ah Capacity = <strong>125 Ah</strong></p>
                                    <p class="key-point"><strong>Important Note:</strong> Real-world battery sizing would significantly increase this value. For example, for 3 days autonomy and a 50% DoD limit:
                                    Required Capacity = (Basic Ah Capacity * Days Autonomy) / Max DoD Fraction
                                    Required Capacity = (125 Ah * 3) / 0.50 = 375 Ah / 0.50 = 750 Ah.
                                    The question asks only for the basic daily Ah requirement based on the system energy, which is 125 Ah.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">PV modules require cleaning and inspection, while batteries need checks on connections, levels (if flooded), and charge status, always observing safety precautions. System sizing must account for available insolation and compensate for inherent system losses. Basic daily energy needs can be converted to Ampere-hours, but practical battery sizing requires considering autonomy and depth of discharge.</p>
