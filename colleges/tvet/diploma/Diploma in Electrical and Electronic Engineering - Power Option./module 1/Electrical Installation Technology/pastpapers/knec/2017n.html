                                <p><strong>(a) Wiring System Explanation</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Wiring System:</strong> A wiring system refers to the complete assembly of electrical cables, their containment (e.g., conduits, trunking, trays, or methods like direct clipping), associated fittings (e.g., bends, boxes, couplings), and termination accessories (e.g., switches, sockets, ceiling roses) used to distribute electrical power from the consumer unit or distribution board to various points of use (lights, appliances, machinery) within a building or structure.</p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Two Factors Considered When Selecting a Wiring System:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Type of Environment / External Influences:</strong> The conditions where the wiring will be installed significantly affect the choice. Factors like presence of moisture (dampness), dust, corrosive substances, risk of mechanical impact, ambient temperature, and whether it's indoors or outdoors dictate the required level of protection (IP rating), durability, and material suitability (e.g., PVC conduit for damp areas, steel conduit for high impact risk).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cost (Economic Considerations):</strong> The budget available for the installation influences the choice of materials and complexity. Some systems (e.g., surface-clipped PVC T&E) are relatively inexpensive, while others (e.g., concealed steel conduit or MIMS cable) are significantly more costly in terms of both materials and labour.</li>
                                    <li><em>Other factors include:</em> Durability required, appearance/aesthetics, flexibility for future alterations, safety regulations, type of building construction.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) First Aid Procedures for Electric Shock Rescue (Construction Site)</strong></p>
                                <p class="key-point"><strong>Priority 1: Ensure Safety of Rescuer and Bystanders. Do NOT touch the victim directly if they are still in contact with the live source.</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Break Electrical Contact Safely:</strong>
                                        <ul><li>Immediately attempt to switch off the power supply at the source (isolator, breaker) if it can be done safely and quickly.</li>
                                            <li>If the power cannot be switched off, use a dry, non-conductive object (dry wood, rope, rubber mat, insulating pole) to push or pull the victim free from the live source, or to move the source away from the victim. Stand on a dry insulating surface yourself if possible. Avoid using metal or wet objects.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Check Response and Call for Help:</strong> Once the victim is clear of the electrical source, check for responsiveness (shout and gently shake). If unresponsive, shout for help immediately and instruct someone specific to call emergency services (providing location details).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Check Breathing:</strong> Open the victim's airway (head tilt, chin lift) and check for normal breathing (look, listen, feel) for no more than 10 seconds.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Perform CPR (If Trained and Necessary):</strong> If the victim is unresponsive and not breathing normally, commence Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) immediately, starting with chest compressions. Continue CPR until professional help arrives, the victim starts breathing normally, or you are exhausted.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Treat Burns and Other Injuries:</strong> Once breathing is established (or while awaiting help if CPR not needed), check for and treat any visible burns (cool with running water if appropriate and cover with sterile dressing) or other injuries sustained during the shock or fall. Keep the victim warm and monitor their condition.</li>
                                </ol>

                                        <li><strong>Renewable Energy Source:</strong> Hydro power utilizes the water cycle, which is a renewable resource, whereas nuclear power relies on finite uranium resources.</li>
                                        <li><strong>No Radioactive Waste:</strong> Hydro power generation does not produce hazardous long-lasting radioactive waste, which is a major environmental and disposal challenge for nuclear power.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs (Typically):</strong> Once built, hydro stations have very low running costs as the fuel (water) is free, unlike nuclear stations which require ongoing fuel procurement and complex waste management. Maintenance costs can also be lower for hydro.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fast Response/Flexibility:</strong> Hydro stations can often start up and change output levels relatively quickly, making them suitable for meeting peak demand and providing grid stability services.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Multiple Uses (Reservoir):</strong> The reservoir created by a hydro dam can often provide other benefits like flood control, irrigation, recreation, and water supply.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Three Topologies of Structured Cables</strong></p>
                                    <p>(Referring typically to network cabling)</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Star Topology:</strong> The most common topology in modern structured cabling (especially for horizontal cabling). All cables run from individual work area outlets directly back to a central hub or switch (located in a telecommunications room or floor distributor). Advantages include ease of management, fault isolation (a fault on one cable only affects one outlet), and scalability. Disadvantage is the requirement for a large amount of cable.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bus Topology:</strong> An older topology where all devices are connected sequentially along a single main cable (the bus). Data travels along the bus, and devices tap into it. Advantages include simplicity and less cable usage initially. Disadvantages include difficulty in troubleshooting (a break affects the entire segment), performance degradation with many devices, and limited scalability. Rarely used for modern LANs but principle seen in some industrial control systems.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ring Topology:</strong> Devices are connected in a closed loop or ring. Data travels around the ring, typically in one direction. Advantages include orderly data transmission (using tokens). Disadvantages include susceptibility to failure (a single break can bring down the ring unless counter-rotating rings are used - FDDI), and difficulty adding/removing devices without disrupting the ring. Used in some legacy systems (Token Ring) and backbone networks (SONET/SDH).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mesh Topology:</strong> Devices are interconnected with multiple links, providing high redundancy and fault tolerance. Full mesh connects every device to every other device; partial mesh connects only some devices redundantly. Used mainly in backbone networks and WANs where reliability is critical, but expensive due to the number of connections required.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tree/Hierarchical Topology:</strong> A combination of star and bus topologies, creating a hierarchical structure. Central hubs (stars) might be connected via a main backbone cable (bus). Common in large networks.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                     <p class="key-point">The question asked for three. Star, Bus, and Ring are common examples taught.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Selecting appropriate tools is basic electrical practice. Hydro power offers renewable energy advantages but has specific siting needs. Different distribution systems cater to various load types, with AC 3-phase 4-wire being prevalent. Structured cabling typically employs a star topology for horizontal runs due to its manageability and fault isolation benefits.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Based on Type of Display/Indication:</strong> e.g., Indicating Instruments (pointer and scale), Recording Instruments (chart recorder), Integrating Instruments (energy meter).</li>

                                     <p class="key-point">The question asked for three classifications.</p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Three Advantages of Permanent Magnet Moving Coil (PMMC) Instruments over Moving Iron (MI):</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Uniform Scale:</strong> PMMC instruments typically have a linear scale because the deflecting torque is directly proportional to the current (T<sub>d</sub> ∝ I), making readings easier and more accurate across the range. MI instruments usually have non-linear, cramped scales, especially at the lower end (T<sub>d</sub> ∝ I²).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Higher Sensitivity / Lower Power Consumption:</strong> PMMC movements require very little current/power to operate due to the strong permanent magnet field, making them highly sensitive and suitable for measuring small currents/voltages with minimal circuit loading. MI instruments generally require more operating power.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Effective Damping:</strong> Eddy current damping in the aluminium former on which the coil is wound is very effective in PMMC instruments, leading to quick settling of the pointer with minimal oscillation. Damping in MI instruments (usually air friction) is often less effective.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Freedom from Hysteresis Error:</strong> PMMC instruments are free from hysteresis errors associated with iron parts used in MI instruments.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="key-point">Main disadvantage of PMMC: Only responds accurately to DC unless a rectifier is used.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Voltmeter Multiplier Calculation</strong></p>
                                    <p>The instrument movement has:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Internal resistance (Rm) = 10 Ω</li>
                                        <li>Full-scale deflection voltage (Vm) = 100 mV = 0.1 V</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>First, calculate the full-scale deflection current (Im) of the movement using Ohm's Law:</p>
                                    <p>Im = Vm / Rm = 0.1 V / 10 Ω = 0.01 A (or 10 mA)</p>
                                    <p>We want to convert this movement into a voltmeter that reads 120 V at full scale (V_fullscale = 120 V). To do this, we need to add a multiplier resistor (Rs) in series with the movement.</p>
                                    <p>The total resistance (Rt) required for the voltmeter to read 120 V when 0.01 A flows is:</p>
                                    <p>Rt = V_fullscale / Im = 120 V / 0.01 A = 12000 Ω</p>
                                    <p>The total resistance Rt is the sum of the movement resistance (Rm) and the series multiplier resistance (Rs):</p>
                                    <p>Rt = Rm + Rs</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, the required multiplier resistance (Rs) is:</p>
                                    <p>Rs = Rt - Rm = 12000 Ω - 10 Ω = <strong>11990 Ω</strong></p>
                                    <p>A resistance of <strong>11990 Ω (or 11.99 kΩ)</strong> must be placed in series with the movement.</p>

(Ref: Appendix 15 guidance).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Continuity Testing:</strong> Specific tests must be carried out upon completion to verify the continuity of all conductors (phase, neutral, CPC) around the entire ring. (Ref: Guidance Note 3 / Part 6).</li>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Reasons for Earthing Electrical Installations</strong></p>
                                    <p>Earthing (or grounding) is a fundamental safety measure in electrical installations primarily for:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Protection Against Electric Shock:</strong> To provide a low-impedance path for fault current to flow to earth if exposed-conductive-parts (like metal casings) become live due to an insulation failure. This large fault current operates a protective device (fuse, MCB, RCD) quickly, disconnecting the supply and preventing the metalwork from remaining at a dangerous potential relative to earth potential that a person might touch.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Voltage Stabilization:</strong> To provide a stable reference potential (close to zero volts or earth potential) for the electrical system, helping to prevent excessive voltages appearing on the system due to phenomena like lightning strikes, switching surges, or faults on higher voltage systems.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Equipment Protection:</strong> In some cases, earthing helps protect sensitive electronic equipment from electrical noise and interference.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Earthing Methods and Electrodes</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Four Methods Used to Achieve Earthing (Earthing Systems):</strong></p>
                                    <p>These refer to the overall system arrangement connecting the installation to earth:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>TN-S (Terra Neutral - Separated):</strong> Supplier provides separate Neutral and Protective Earth conductors from the transformer to the consumer's premises. Consumer connects MET to the supplier's PE terminal.</li>
                                        <li><strong>TN-C-S (Terra Neutral - Combined Separated) / PME:</strong> Supplier combines Neutral and Protective Earth functions in one conductor (PEN) in the network, earthing it multiple times. At the consumer intake, the PEN is split into separate N and PE terminals provided by the supplier. Consumer connects MET to the supplier's PE terminal.</li>
                                        <li><strong>TT (Terra Terra):</strong> Supplier earths their transformer neutral. Consumer provides their *own* independent earth electrode connection for their installation's MET, separate from the supplier's earth.</li>
                                        <li><strong>IT (Isolé Terra):</strong> The supply system has no intentional connection to earth at the source (or is earthed through a high impedance). The installation's exposed-conductive-parts are earthed independently or collectively. Used in special applications requiring high supply continuity (e.g., medical facilities, some industrial processes).</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li><strong>Earth Plates:</strong> Solid metal plates (copper or galvanized steel) buried vertically or horizontally.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Earth Tapes/Strips:</strong> Copper or galvanized steel tapes buried horizontally in trenches.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Foundation Earth Electrodes:</strong> Conductors embedded within the concrete foundations of a building during construction.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Underground Structural Metalwork:</strong> Utilizing existing metallic structures like pipelines (if permitted and suitable) or well casings as electrodes (requires careful assessment).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Wire Electrodes / Earth Mats:</strong> Grids or arrangements of buried bare conductors forming an earth mat, often used for substations or where low resistance is difficult to achieve with rods/plates.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> The protective devices must be sensitive enough to detect the smallest fault current that could cause danger (e.g., operate reliably on a high impedance earth fault for RCDs, or detect sustained small overloads for MCBs/fuses) within the required time.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Speed of Operation:</strong> Protection must operate quickly enough to prevent injury (electric shock) or damage to equipment and minimize fire risk. Disconnection times for electric shock protection are specified in regulations based on system type and voltage.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Protective devices must operate correctly when called upon throughout their service life. They should be robust and require minimal maintenance.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The protection system should remain stable and not operate unnecessarily (nuisance tripping) under normal operating conditions, including transient events like motor starting or switching surges.</li>

Key components typically include detectors (smoke, heat), manual call points (break glass units), a control panel (which processes signals and manages the system), sounders/strobes (bells, sirens, visual alarms), and often an automatic connection to the fire brigade.</p>

                                    <p>This test measures the resistance to the general mass of earth offered by the installation's earth electrode system. The most common method is the 'Fall of Potential' method using a dedicated 3- or 4-terminal Earth Tester.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Instrument:</strong> Earth Resistance Tester (3- or 4-pole).</p>
                                    <p><strong>Procedure (Fall of Potential - 3 Pole Method):</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Disconnect Electrode:</strong> Temporarily disconnect the installation's earth electrode (E) from the Main Earthing Terminal (MET) to measure only the electrode's resistance.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Place Test Spikes:</strong> Drive two auxiliary test spikes into the ground in a straight line away from the earth electrode (E).
                                            <ul><li>Current Spike (C): Driven far away (e.g., 20-30 meters or more, ideally 5-10 times the electrode depth/length).</li>
                                                <li>Potential Spike (P): Driven between E and C, typically at about 62% of the distance from E to C.</li></ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Connect Tester:</strong> Connect the tester terminals:
                                             <ul><li>E terminal to the disconnected earth electrode under test.</li>
                                                 <li>P terminal to the Potential spike.</li>
                                                 <li>C terminal to the Current spike.</li></ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Execute Test:</strong> Operate the earth tester according to its instructions. It injects an AC current between E and C and measures the potential difference between E and P. Using Ohm's Law (R = V/I), it calculates and displays the earth electrode resistance (R<sub>E</sub>).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Verify Reading:</strong> Take additional readings by moving the potential spike (P) slightly closer to E and slightly further away (e.g., 10% of E-C distance each way). If the resistance readings remain relatively stable, the initial measurement is likely accurate. If they vary significantly, the current spike (C) may need to be moved further away.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reconnect Electrode:</strong> After testing, securely reconnect the earth electrode to the MET.</li>

                                     <p>In summary: Photons from sunlight strike the P-N junction in the semiconductor (silicon). If photons have sufficient energy, they create electron-hole pairs. The junction's electric field separates these charges (electrons to N-side, holes to P-side), creating a voltage. Connecting an external circuit allows current (flow of electrons) to be drawn from the cell.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Four Features Considered When Selecting a Domestic PV Module</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Power Rating (Watts - Wp):</strong> The nominal power output under Standard Test Conditions (STC). This determines how much energy the panel can produce and influences the total number of panels needed to meet energy requirements.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Physical Size and Weight:</strong> Important for determining if the panels will fit in the available roof space and whether the roof structure can support the weight.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Efficiency (%):</strong> Higher efficiency panels produce more power per unit area, useful for limited roof space, but often come at a higher cost per watt.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Warranty (Product and Performance):</strong> A good product warranty (covering materials and workmanship, e.g., 10-15 years) and a long performance warranty (guaranteeing a certain percentage of power output after 25 years) indicate manufacturer confidence and provide investment protection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cost (€/$/£ per Watt):</strong> Comparing the cost relative to the power output helps determine the economic value.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Temperature Coefficient:</strong> Indicates how much power output decreases as module temperature increases. Important in hot climates. A lower (less negative) percentage per °C is better.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Manufacturer Reputation and Reliability:</strong> Choosing established manufacturers with proven track records and good customer support can be beneficial for long-term reliability and warranty claims.</li>

                                    <p class="answer-intro">This answer defines insolation and solar incident angle, calculates system energy requirements, lists maintenance tools, determines lamp power, and outlines cable joint types relevant to solar installations.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Solar Term Definitions</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Insolation (Incident Solar Radiation):</strong> The amount of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area during a given time period. It is often expressed in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kWh/m²/day) or per year, representing the total solar energy available for harvesting over time. It differs from irradiance, which is instantaneous power per area (W/m²).</p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) Solar Incident Angle (Angle of Incidence):</strong> The angle between the sun's rays striking a surface and the line perpendicular (normal) to that surface. A zero-degree incident angle means the sun's rays are directly perpendicular to the surface, maximizing energy intensity. A larger angle means the sunlight is spread over a larger area, reducing intensity.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Energy Calculation and Maintenance Tools</strong></p>
                                    <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) Total Daily System Energy Requirement:</strong></p>
                                    <p>First, calculate the daily energy consumption (Wh) for each appliance:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fluorescent lamp: 14 W * 4 h = 56 Wh</li>
                                        <li>Colour TV: 80 W * 3 h = 240 Wh</li>
                                        <li>Lamps (assuming total 10W): 10 W * 8 h = 80 Wh</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Total Daily Load Energy = 56 Wh + 240 Wh + 80 Wh = <strong>376 Wh/day</strong></p>
                                    <p>Now, account for 15% energy losses (0.15 loss fraction). The energy drawn from the source (battery/system) must be higher.</p>
                                    <p>Total Daily System Energy Requirement = Total Load Energy / (1 - Loss Fraction)</p>
                                    <p>System Energy = 376 Wh / (1 - 0.15) = 376 Wh / 0.85</p>
                                    <p>System Energy ≈ <strong>442.35 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>(d) Four Types of Cable Joints Used in Solar Installations</strong></p>
                                    <p>While permanent joints in main DC runs are often discouraged in favour of continuous runs or specialized connectors, common methods for connections/terminations include:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>MC4 Connectors (or similar PV connectors):</strong> These are industry-standard, weatherproof, locking connectors used for interconnecting PV modules and connecting strings to combiner boxes or home run cables. They provide a reliable, low-resistance, plug-and-play connection designed specifically for PV applications. (Strictly a connector, but the primary 'joining' method for modules).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Crimp Lugs/Terminals:</strong> Used to terminate larger DC cables (e.g., from combiner box to controller, controller to battery, battery to inverter) onto terminal studs or busbars. A calibrated crimping tool ensures a secure mechanical and electrical connection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Screw Terminals (in Enclosures):</strong> Found inside combiner boxes, charge controllers, DC distribution boxes, and inverters. Stripped cable ends are inserted and clamped securely under a screw or pressure plate. Requires correct tightening torque.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insulation Displacement Connectors (IDCs):</strong> Sometimes used in specific low-power DC applications or within certain pre-fabricated components, where a blade cuts through the insulation to make contact with the conductor. Less common for main power wiring.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Waterproof Junction Boxes with Terminal Blocks:</strong> For outdoor connections or joining cables where connectors aren't suitable, weatherproof junction boxes fitted with appropriate DIN rail terminals or connector blocks provide a secure and protected environment for making connections using screw or spring cage terminals.</li>
                                        <li><em>Note:</em> Traditional soldered joints like married or tee joints are generally avoided for field connections in modern PV installations due to potential reliability issues outdoors unless properly environmentally sealed, and preference for mechanical methods.</li>
