                                <p><strong>(b) Fire Extinguisher Descriptions</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**</p>
                                <p>Contains liquefied CO₂ gas under pressure. When discharged, it emerges as a very cold gas and "snow," displacing oxygen around the fire and cooling the fuel. Identified by a black band/label and a distinctive discharge horn. Primarily used for Class B (flammable liquid) and Class E (electrical) fires. Leaves no residue but offers little post-fire cooling and can pose an asphyxiation risk in confined spaces.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Water Extinguisher:**</p>
                                <p>Contains water propelled by stored pressure (air/nitrogen) or a CO₂ cartridge. Works primarily by cooling the burning material below its ignition temperature. Identified by a solid red cylinder or red band. Suitable *only* for Class A fires (solid combustibles like wood, paper, fabric). **Dangerous** to use on electrical fires (risk of shock) or flammable liquid/fat fires (can spread the fire).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Dry Powder:**</p>
                                <p>Contains fine powder (e.g., sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, monoammonium phosphate) propelled by stored pressure or a gas cartridge. Works mainly by chemically inhibiting the combustion chain reaction and forming a barrier between fuel and oxygen. ABC rated powder is versatile for Class A, B, and C fires and is safe for electrical fires (non-conductive). Identified by a blue band. Main disadvantage is the messy residue which can damage electronics and cause visibility issues during discharge.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Steel Conduit Work: Tools and Maintenance</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Tools and Equipment for Steel Conduit Work:**</p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li><strong>Threading (if using threaded conduit):</strong> Conduit Stock and Dies (matched to conduit size, e.g., 20mm, 25mm), Cutting Oil/Lubricant.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bending (if forming bends on site):</strong> Conduit Bending Machine or Bending Springs (manual methods require skill).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Assembly & Fixing:</strong> Conduit Pliers (optional), Spanners (for locknuts/couplers), Screwdrivers (for fixing boxes/saddles), Drill and Bits (for fixing holes).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cable Installation:</strong> Draw Wire/Tape or Fish Tape (for pulling cables).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fittings:</strong> Conduit pipes, bends, elbows, tees, junction boxes (various types), couplers, saddles, male/female bushes, locknuts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Care and Maintenance of Tools in a Workshop:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Clean tools regularly after use to remove dirt, grease, metal filings, or chemical residues.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store tools properly in designated racks, drawers, toolboxes, or shadow boards. Protect cutting edges and measuring surfaces. Keep tools dry to prevent rust.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Regularly inspect tools for damage (cracked handles, mushroomed heads, worn tips/blades, damaged insulation). Report or replace defective tools immediately.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lubrication:</strong> Apply oil or appropriate lubricant to moving parts (e.g., gears, hinges, screws) and metal surfaces prone to rust. Keep cutting fluid available for threading/drilling.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sharpening:</strong> Keep cutting edges (chisels, drill bits, hacksaw blades - replace when dull) sharp for efficient and safe operation. Maintain file cleanliness with a file card.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Ensure measuring instruments (torque wrenches, multimeters) are calibrated regularly according to manufacturer or workshop schedules.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Structured Cabling Definitions</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Backbone Cabling:**</p>
                                <p>(See Answer to Q1(b) in 2021j paper). The part of the structured cabling system providing interconnection between key network locations, such as telecommunications rooms (TRs), equipment rooms (ERs), and entrance facilities (EFs). It includes vertical cabling between floors and horizontal cabling between buildings in a campus environment. Typically uses high-bandwidth media like fiber optic cable or high-pair-count copper cable.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Horizontal Cabling:**</p>
                                <p>(See Answer to Q5(a)(ii) in 2020j paper). The portion of the structured cabling system extending from the horizontal cross-connect (HC) in the telecommunications room (TR) on a floor out to the individual work area outlets (WAOs) or sockets. It includes the horizontal cables, terminations at the patch panel (HC) and the WAO. Usually installed in a star topology.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Workshop safety involves using PPE and understanding accident causes. Different fire extinguishers suit specific fire classes. Steel conduit work requires specialized tools for cutting, threading, bending, and assembly, while proper tool care ensures longevity and safety. Structured cabling uses backbone and horizontal subsystems for organized communication wiring.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Proximity to Fuel Source / Transport Links:</strong> For coal or oil plants, being near mines or having efficient transport links (rail, port, pipeline) for fuel delivery is crucial to minimize fuel costs. Gas plants need access to gas pipelines.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Availability of Cooling Water:</strong> Steam plants require vast amounts of cooling water for their condensers. Location near a large river, lake, or the sea is essential.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Land Availability and Cost:</strong> Large area needed for the plant, fuel storage (especially coal), ash disposal (for coal), switchyard, and potential future expansion. Land cost should be reasonable.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Distance from Load Centres / Grid Connection:</strong> While power can be transmitted long distances, minimizing transmission distance reduces costs and losses. Proximity to high-voltage grid connection points is necessary.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Environmental Considerations:</strong> Impact on air quality (emissions), water temperature (thermal discharge), noise levels, and visual amenity must be assessed. Site should comply with environmental regulations and consider prevailing wind directions relative to population centers. Ash disposal methods (for coal) require suitable sites.</li>

Similar principles apply to ceiling voids where penetration by fixings is foreseeable. (Ref: Regulation Group 522.6).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Support and Segregation:</strong> Cables must be adequately supported throughout their length to prevent undue strain. They should be segregated from non-electrical services (e.g., water pipes, gas pipes) and from communication cables according to regulations to prevent mutual detrimental influence (heat, interference). (Ref: Regulation Group 522.8, Section 528).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Consideration of Thermal Insulation:</strong> If cables run through or are surrounded by thermal insulation in the ceiling void, their current carrying capacity must be appropriately derated using correction factor C<sub>i</sub>.

                                    <p><strong>(a) Procedure for Determining Cable Size (Simplified - BS 7671)</strong></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Determine Design Current (Ib):</strong> Calculate the current the circuit is expected to carry under normal operating conditions (Power / Voltage, considering diversity if applicable).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Select Protective Device Type and Rating (In):</strong> Choose a suitable protective device (MCB, fuse) and its nominal current rating (In). Ensure In ≥ Ib.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Determine Installation Method:</strong> Identify how the cable will be installed (e.g., clipped direct, in conduit, in trunking, buried) by referring to reference methods in BS 7671 Appendix 4.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Apply Correction Factors:</strong> Identify and apply all relevant correction factors based on installation conditions:
                                            <ul><li>C<sub>a</sub> (Ambient Temperature)</li>
                                                <li>C<sub>g</sub> (Grouping - mutual heating from adjacent cables)</li>
                                                <li>C<sub>i</sub> (Thermal Insulation)</li>
                                                <li>C<sub>f</sub> (Protective device type - only 0.725 for rewireable fuses, usually 1 otherwise)</li>
                                                <li><em>(Other factors like C<sub>s</sub> for semi-enclosed fuses may apply).</em></li></ul>
                                            Calculate the total correction factor C = C<sub>a</sub> * C<sub>g</sub> * C<sub>i</sub> * C<sub>f</sub> * ...</li>
                                        <li><strong>Calculate Minimum Required Tabulated Current (It):</strong> The cable must be chosen based on a tabulated rating (It) found in BS 7671 Appendix 4 tables, such that It ≥ In / C. (Note: Some sources use It ≥ Ib / C, ensure coordination rule Iz ≥ In is also met).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Select Potential Cable Size:</strong> Look up the relevant table in BS 7671 Appendix 4 for the chosen installation method and cable type. Find the smallest conductor cross-sectional area (CSA) whose tabulated current rating (Iz, which corresponds to It under standard conditions) is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum required rating (It).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Voltage Drop:</strong> Calculate the voltage drop for the selected cable size over the circuit length using the (mV/A/m) value from BS 7671 Appendix 4 tables ( Vd = (mV/A/m) * Ib * Length / 1000 ). Ensure the calculated voltage drop does not exceed the permissible limits (e.g., 3% for lighting, 5% for power). If it does, select the next larger cable size and recheck.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Thermal Constraints / Fault Protection (Adiabatic Equation):</strong> Verify that the cable can withstand the energy let-through (I²t) of the protective device under fault conditions without excessive temperature rise (using the adiabatic equation S = sqrt(I²t)/k). Ensure disconnection times are met (related to Earth Fault Loop Impedance check).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Final Selection:</strong> The chosen cable size must satisfy all conditions: current carrying capacity (after derating), voltage drop, and thermal constraints.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Selection and Erection:</strong> Cables must be selected and installed appropriately for the external influences they are likely to encounter (temperature, water, impact, UV radiation, corrosive substances etc.) and supported correctly to avoid damage. (Ref: Chapter 52).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Cores of cables must be identifiable by colour (or numbering) according to the standards (e.g., Brown/Black/Grey for phases, Blue for Neutral, Green/Yellow for Protective Earth). (Ref: Regulation Group 514.3).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bending Radii:</strong> Cables must not be bent tighter than their minimum recommended internal bending radius during installation, to avoid damaging conductors or insulation. (Ref: Regulation 522.8.3).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Protection Against Damage:</strong> Cables must be protected against mechanical damage, impact, abrasion, tension, and damage from fauna/flora throughout their run. (Ref: Regulation Group 522).</li>

 Operation:
 1. Armed State: Key switch closed, Sensors OPEN. No current flows to control/alarm circuit. Alarm is OFF.
 2. Intrusion: If a sensor CLOSES (e.g., pressure mat stepped on, tripwire contact made), it completes the circuit.
 3. Alarm Trigger: Current flows through the closed sensor to the control panel/relay logic, which activates the alarm bell/siren.

                                        <li><strong>Simplicity/Low Cost:</strong> Generally simpler circuitry and potentially lower cost compared to closed-circuit systems, especially using basic sensors like pressure mats or trip contacts.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Low Standby Power Consumption:</strong> No current flows through the sensor loop when the system is armed and undisturbed, consuming minimal power until triggered.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Suitable for Specific Sensors:</strong> Ideal for sensors that naturally create a closed circuit upon activation, such as pressure mats or some types of panic buttons.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Operation Explanation:**</p>
                                    <p>A wattmeter measures electrical power (Watts). It typically contains two internal coils:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Current Coil (CC):</strong> Has low resistance and is connected **in series** with the load, like an ammeter. The magnetic field produced by this coil is proportional to the load current (I).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Voltage Coil (VC) (or Potential Coil):</strong> Has high resistance and is connected **in parallel** across the load, like a voltmeter. The current flowing through this coil (and thus its magnetic field) is proportional to the load voltage (V).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>The interaction between the magnetic fields produced by both coils causes a deflecting torque on the meter's pointer (in analog meters) or is processed electronically (in digital meters). This torque/reading is proportional to the product of Voltage, Current, and the Cosine of the phase angle between them (Power Factor, Cos φ) for AC circuits: **Power = V × I × Cos φ**. In DC circuits, Cos φ = 1, so Power = V × I.</p>


                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Trickle charging maintains battery charge. Alkaline batteries offer benefits like higher energy density or longer shelf life depending on type. Charging circuits require series resistors to limit current. Open-circuit alarms trigger when a sensor closes the circuit. Wattmeters use current and voltage coils to measure power.</p>

                                    <p><strong>(i) Three Functions of a Charge Controller:**</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Overcharge Protection:</strong> Prevents the battery from being charged beyond its safe maximum voltage, which would damage the battery and shorten its life. It does this by regulating or stopping the current flow from the PV array when the battery is full.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Deep Discharge Protection (Low Voltage Disconnect - LVD):</strong> Disconnects the connected DC loads when the battery voltage drops below a preset minimum level, preventing excessive discharge which damages the battery. (Not all controllers have load terminals/LVD).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Prevent Reverse Current Flow:</strong> Stops current from flowing back from the battery to the PV array at night, which would discharge the battery. (Often done using blocking diodes or MOSFETs).</li>
                                        <li><em>(MPPT controllers add):</em> <strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking:</strong> Optimizes the match between the PV array and the battery, ensuring the array operates at its maximum power output voltage under varying sunlight conditions, increasing energy harvest.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                     <p class="key-point">The question asked for three.</p>
                                    <p><strong>(ii) Tracking for a PV Module:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q7(a)(ii) in 2016n paper). A mechanical system that automatically adjusts the orientation (tilt and/or azimuth angle) of a PV module or array throughout the day to keep it pointed directly at the sun. This maximizes the incident solar radiation on the module surface, significantly increasing the total daily energy production compared to a fixed (non-tracking) module.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Switches and sockets provide isolation and connection points in PV systems. Completion tests verify safety and function. Conduit and specialized solar cables are common wiring methods. Charge controllers protect batteries and manage energy flow. Tracking systems maximize energy capture by following the sun.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Faster Drying Speed:</strong> The enclosed structure traps heat (greenhouse effect), raising the temperature and often creating airflow (convection), which accelerates the drying process compared to open sun drying.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fuel Savings:</strong> Utilizes free solar energy, eliminating the need for fuel used in artificial dryers.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Simple Construction/Low Cost:</strong> Basic designs can often be built using locally available materials at relatively low cost.</li>

Key energy conversions are thermal and photovoltaic. Solar energy is harvested actively (PV, thermal collectors) or passively. Direct solar dryers use trapped solar heat and convection to efficiently and hygienically dry crops.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Orientation (Azimuth):</strong> Modules should ideally face the equator (due South in Northern Hemisphere, due North in Southern Hemisphere) to maximize daily energy capture. Deviations may be necessary due to roof layout but reduce output.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tilt Angle:</strong> The angle relative to the horizontal. Optimal tilt depends on latitude and desired seasonal performance (e.g., steeper angle favors winter sun, shallower angle favors summer sun, latitude angle often used for year-round).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Shading Avoidance:</strong> Mount modules in a location free from shading from trees, buildings, chimneys, or other obstructions, especially during peak sunlight hours (e.g., 9 am to 3 pm), as even partial shading drastically reduces output.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Structural Integrity & Fixing Method:</strong> The mounting surface (roof, ground mount) must be strong enough to support the weight of the modules and mounting system, plus wind and snow loads. Appropriate, secure, and weatherproof fixings must be used.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessibility & Airflow:</strong> Allow space for maintenance access if possible. Ensure some airflow behind modules to help dissipate heat, as high temperatures reduce efficiency.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(b) Sizing Factors for Battery and Inverter</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>(i) Three Factors When Sizing a Solar Battery:**</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Total Daily System Energy Requirement (Wh):</strong> The amount of energy the battery needs to supply daily, including load demand and system losses.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Days of Autonomy Required:</strong> The number of consecutive cloudy days the battery must power the loads without solar input.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Maximum Allowable Depth of Discharge (DoD):</strong> The percentage of the battery's total capacity that can be safely used regularly without significantly shortening its life (e.g., 50% for lead-acid, 80-90% for lithium). Required Ah Capacity = (Wh/day * Autonomy Days) / (Voltage * Max DoD%).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Temperature Correction:</strong> Battery capacity decreases at low temperatures; sizing may need adjustment for cold climates.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Charge/Discharge Rate Limits (C-Rate):</strong> Ensure the battery can safely handle the expected maximum charge current from the controller and discharge current to the loads/inverter.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p><strong>(ii) Three Factors When Sizing a DC-AC Solar Inverter:**</p>
                                    <p>(See Answer to Q6(b)(i) in 2016j paper).</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Continuous Power Rating (W/VA):</strong> Must exceed the sum of the power ratings of all AC loads expected to run simultaneously.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Surge Power Rating (W/VA):</strong> Must be high enough to handle the starting surge of motor loads (fridges, pumps).</li>
                                        <li><strong>DC Input Voltage:</strong> Must match the nominal voltage of the battery bank (12V, 24V, 48V).</li>
                                        <li><strong>AC Output Voltage/Frequency:</strong> Must match the requirements of the AC loads (e.g., 230V/50Hz).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Waveform Type (Pure Sine Wave vs Modified Sine Wave):</strong> PSW needed for sensitive electronics/motors.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(c) Energy and Charge Requirement Calculations</strong></p>
                                    <p>Loads:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lamps: 2 * 8 W * 6 h = 96 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>TV: 1 * 60 W * 3 h = 180 Wh/day</li>
                                        <li>Charger: 1 * 3 W * 2 h = 6 Wh/day</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>System Voltage = 12 V</p>
                                    <p>System Losses = 20% (Loss Fraction = 0.20)</p>

                                    <p><strong>(i) Total Daily Load Energy Demand:**</p>
                                    <p>Load Energy = 96 Wh + 180 Wh + 6 Wh = <strong>282 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>(ii) Total Daily System Energy Requirements:**</p>
                                    <p>System Energy = Load Energy / (1 - Loss Fraction)</p>
                                    <p>System Energy = 282 Wh / (1 - 0.20) = 282 Wh / 0.80</p>
                                    <p>System Energy = <strong>352.5 Wh/day</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>(iii) Charge Requirement if the System Voltage is 12 V:**</p>
                                    <p>(Assuming "Charge Requirement" means the Ampere-hour capacity needed to be supplied by the battery daily to meet the System Energy Requirement).</p>
                                    <p>Daily Charge Requirement (Ah) = System Energy (Wh) / System Voltage (V)</p>
                                    <p>Daily Charge Requirement (Ah) = 352.5 Wh / 12 V</p>
                                    <p>Daily Charge Requirement (Ah) ≈ <strong>29.38 Ah/day</strong></p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">PV module mounting requires considering orientation, tilt, and shading. Maintenance involves cleaning and inspection. Battery sizing depends on energy needs, autonomy, and DoD, while inverter sizing depends on AC load power and surge needs. Energy calculations determine daily load and system requirements, which can be converted to Ampere-hour charge requirements based on system voltage.</p>
