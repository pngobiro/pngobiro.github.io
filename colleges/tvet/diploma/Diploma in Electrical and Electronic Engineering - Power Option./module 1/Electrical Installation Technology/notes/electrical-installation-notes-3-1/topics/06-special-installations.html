This system is also known as grid suspension system and consists of a central galvanized steel, high tensile stranded wire surrounded by a number of p.v.c insulated conductors and the whole is enclosed with p.v.c tape and p.v.c sheathing. Special connecting boxes are used at tees and right angled turns.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Flammable gases and vapours encountered with industry are classified into:</p>
                        <p>Group I: Gases encountered in coal mining e.g. methane</p>
                        <p>Group II: Petrochemical gases e.g. propane butane pentane ammonia carbon monoxide etc</p>

                        <p>Group IV: Acetylene and hydrogen.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">POTENTIAL DANGER AREAS</h4>
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">DIVISION 0</h5>
                        <p>This is an area in which flammable vapours are continuously present. This is the most dangerous area and generally it is recommended that electric equipment should not be installed there.</p>
                        <p>If it is necessary to install electrical equipment then the system of electrical enclosures could be pressurized above atmospheric pressure so that no explosive vapours inbuilt pass into the electrical system. An alternative method would be to install the electric motor and its control gear outside the area and have the drive shaft coupled to the driven machine (in the hazardous area) via a flame proof seal in the dividing wall.</p>
                        
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">DIVISION I</h5>
                        <p>This is a less dangerous area than division o and flame proof equipment is installed.</p>
                        <p>Flame proof equipment is designed that it will withstand an internal explosion of the particular gas for which it is certified and also prevents any spark or flame from that explosion escaping from enclosure and igniting the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>These areas may be wired in:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Armored cable</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">MICC cables with flame proof glands and for underground installations it should have a PVC oversheath.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Single or multicore cables enclosed in solid drawn heavy duty conduit protected against corrosion. All conduit boxes and inspection fittings must be flame proof.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">DIVISION 2</h5>
                        <p>This is less dangerous than division I areas where the equipment is unlikely to produce arc sparks during operation. It may be possible to install normal wiring systems with special attention to cable entries.</p>
                        <p>Regular testing must be carried out by competent personnel. On mixed installation where there are hazardous and safe areas the electrical installation should revert from flame proof wiring to normal wiring systems provided that suitable sealing boxes are used.</p>
                        <p>These areas may be wired in:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">MICC with PVC oversheath for underground</span></li>
