\section*{SAFETY}

\section*{SAFETY IN THE WORKSHOP}

Safety: it is freedom from danger or harm. In the workshop safety may be achieved by not taking any risk taking precaution much more than necessary. Before anyone can install a safe and efficient electrical system it is essential for him or her to be familiar of risk of electricity and the danger inherent in its use.

Electrical safety: this involves proper use of electrical equipment and machinery to perform a divine task safely and economically. Safe operation of machines are safety to personnel, should be given the best consideration. When working in a circuit it must be completely isolated and tests should be carried out to ensure that poles of the cct are dead. At the position of isolation steps should be taken to ensure that the cct cannot be restored until required. Any isolation must be provided with a lock position, secure fixed warning should be displayed on the isolator board. Where fuses are removed, they should be put in a safe position where they cannot be replaced without the knowledge of the person concerned. Ensure that no similar fuses are readily available. The cct should be isolated as near to the work as possible so that visual check can be kept on any attempt to restore a supply. After carrying out works always test for possible faults which may be due to excessive current flow before restoring the supply.

Special safety requirements: when corrosive liquids are being handled by an electrician or maintaining and installing battery the following precautions should be taken into consideration:
> Protective clothing is necessary such as rubber gloves, overall to protect body from burns with acids.
$>$ In this installation good ventilation is necessary to reduce the building up of inflammable and dangerous chemical vapours.
> Never allow naked flames near a battery installation.

\section*{General workshop rules}
1. Do not meddle with switches, knobs, and rivets handles e.t.c.
2. Do not lean on electric machines.
3. Do not jump or play in the workshop.
4. Do not stare on welding arc lights without wearing guard.
5. Take care when working with hot metals use suitable glasses.
6. Do not operate electric machine before you know how to stop it.
7. Do not lubricate any moving machine.
8. Do not remove machine guard before stopping the machine.
9. Do not use faulty tools.
10. Never touch any moving machine.
11.Use or wear protective clothing for particular job.
12.Any loose clothing e.g. ties, shirts long hairs, should be avoided where there is a rotating machine.
13. Obey all working warnings on the notice boards.
14.Never switch on a machine and leave it running.
15.Avoid overworking or overcrowding a machine.
16.Use the right tool for the right work in the right way at the right time.

Accident: an accident is unexpected and undesirable occurrence resulting into injury or damage to human beings or to properties.

\section*{Causes of accidents:}
- Carelessness: familiarity of tasks sets in boredom therefore original high standards begin to slide which leads to accidents.
- Ignorance: this is due to lack of sufficient technical knowledge to perform a task efficiently and to leave it in a condition which is safe.
- Panic
- Laziness
- Drunkenness

\section*{Electrical hazards:}

They affect;
I. Human beings: through electric shock and burns.
II. Properties ; e.g. buildings furniture
III. Environment; through pollution due to chemical reactions.

\section*{ELECTRIC SHOCK}

It is the effect felt by the body when electric current flows through the body. This happens when the body acts as a link between two points of different potential. Shock is sudden and causes disturbance of feelings of the nervous system.

\section*{Types of electric shock}

A] hand to hand: it cuts across the chest where the vital body parts are situated and it happens where conductors are held by both hands and is likely to result to death.

B] Hand to foot: it occurs when the conductor is between the hand and the foot. It is usually not serious though it may result to paralysis.

\section*{Factors determining the severity of shock:}
1) Amount of current flowing through the body.
2) The time of contact.
3) The voltage level.
4) The body resistance

\section*{FIRST AID:}

It is the application of accepted principles of treatment on occurrence of any injury or incase of sudden illness using facilities or materials available at that time to sustain live to prevent condition from becoming worse. In every factory, workshop or construction site a first Aid box containing all the necessary facilities must be provided and workers should know where to go to obtain first Aid materials.

\section*{Order of action to safe an electrocuted victim}
* Switch off the power supply then isolate the victim from the supply.
* One must be very careful not to touch the victim when the switch is on.
* The victim must be pushed or pulled away by his/her clothes or ay insulating material.
* Check for tight cloth and untie them.
* Remove the victim from the scene of crime as quickly as possible.
* Check any sign of life in the victim and start artificial respiration immediately.
* Send for a doctor or medical personnel or ambulance.
* Report the matter to the police.

NB//: never leave the victim alone.

\section*{Methods of artificial respiration}
1. Holger Nielsen method:
- Place the patient face downwards the forehead resting on his hands.
- If the patients tongue has been swallowed 2 or 3 firm slaps with the flat of the hand on the area between the shoulders will bring it forward.
- The rescuer should kneel in front of the patient a knee beside the right of the head and a foot to the left of the patient's elbow.
- The arms should slope forward so that the hands lie close together on the patient's shoulder.
- The wrists should be over the top of the shoulder blade and then begin the movement as follows:
i. Move forward and press down with a light pressure to drive air from the lungs. These movements should last about 2 seconds.
ii. Slide hands quickly down the patient's elbow and the movement should take a second.
iii. Raise the elbow slightly.
iv. The rescuers body should move backwards a bit low this induces air to the lungs and shall take 2 seconds.
v. Lower the elbow and slide hands to patient's back to resume original position.
vi. Repeat the above movement until the patient recovers.

\section*{2. Mouth to mouth [kiss of life]:}
> Place the patient on his back and sit or kneel by the side of his head.
> The head should be held with both hands.
> One hand should press upward while the other push the jaw up and forwards this position ensures that the patient's lungs gets maximum air.
> Close the patient's nose with one hand.
> Seal your lips round the patient's mouth.
> Blow air steadily into the patient's mouth until the swelling of lungs cause the chest to rise.
$>$ Remove your mouth, turn your head aside and take a deep breath.
> Repeat this cycle six times as quickly as possible.
$>$ Continue at about 10 sec intervals.

\section*{3. Sylvester[revised] method}
- Position the casualty on his back quickly.
- Probe up shoulder with a suitable padding e.g. a rolled jacket so that the head falls fully backward to open up air passage.
- Kneel near the casualty's head, take his hands at the wrist then cross them and press firmly downwards to force air out of the lungs.
- Release the downward pressure by pulling their arms upwards above his head and backwards as far as possible.
- This helps to throw air in the lungs.
- If breathing, restart and adjust movement to coincide with his breathing speed.

\section*{ELECTRIC BURNS}
- They are best seen by a first Aid expert or a doctor.
- Burned clothing should not be removed.
- Blisters should not be broken.
- Sterilized dressing may be applied if necessary.
- The patient may be given water, tea, coffee or other liquids but not alcohol.
- Keep the patient warm at all times and take him to the doctor or expertise.

\section*{HAZARD TO PROPERTY}

\section*{Fire safety:}

\section*{Fire prevention:}

In order to minimize the risk of fire it is advantagesisable to make sure that:
- all appliances are switched off after use
- all are highly combustible materials are kept away from any source of heat
- Smoking and naked flames should be prohibited in some areas e.g. near batteries.

For fire to exist there are three things which must be present namely:
* Fuel [wood, paper, petrol e.t.c]
* Oxygen [combustion]
* Heat [e.g. flame]

\section*{Fire detection:}
i. Human detection: this is limited to an individual noticing the fire and raising the alarm manually at a break the glass call point.
ii. Smoke detection:
iii. Heat detection:

Both ii and iii sense automatically and operates the alarm system.

\section*{Fire control:}

They are divided into:
a) Manual; this by use of hand held extinguishers.
b) Automatic; this is by use of sprinklers, guns e.t.c

Both systems use the same extinguishing substances e.g. water powder foam e.t.c

\section*{Classes of fire:}

Fires are divided into three classes depending on the fuel supporting it.
Class A: wood, textile, paper
Class B: petrol, oil, paints
Class C: electric current or electric equipment.
Not all fires can be extinguished by the same kind of extinguishing material each class has a specific extinguisher. It is a legal requirement that all fire extinguisher are colored red but with a block or band, denoting the type of extinguisher.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Type of extinguisher & Most suited for & Class of fire & Color band [container] \\
\hline Water & Wood paper textile & A & Signal red \\
\hline Carbon dioxide & Petrol paint oil & B & Black \\
\hline Foam[ $\mathrm{h}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ] & Petrol, paint, oil & B & Pale cream \\
\hline Powder & Wood, petrol, electric fire & A,B,C & French blue \\
\hline Halogenated hydrocarbon gas & Petrol, oil, electric & B,C & Emerald green. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Some kinds of materials e.g. plastic and chemicals give off high toxic fumes when ignited. Under such circumstances special apparatus would be needed to minimize the danger to the fire fighter.

\section*{ELECTRICAL MATERIALS}

There are three types of materials i.e.
i) Conductors
ii) Insulators
iii) Semiconductors

\section*{CONDUCTORS}

Its any material which allows free passage of an electric current. Conducting materials vary in the degree to which they can conduct electricity therefore have different applications e.g. good conductors are required for connecting leads in electric ccts for minimum current or voltage loss while materials with higher resistance are sometimes needed for controlling currents e.g. of rheostats and motor control starters. Some materials used as conductors are:

\section*{A] Silver}

It's the best conductor known but its too expensive for general use.

\section*{B] Copper}

Its conductivity is second to silver and its widely used for the manufacture of electric wires, cables and busbars.

\section*{ADVANTAGES}
i) Has low resistance
ii) Its ductile there4 easily formed into wires.
iii) It is readily tinned for soldering.

\section*{C] ALMINIUM}

Not as good as copper but its light in weight, this is an advantages in many situations.

\section*{D] BRASS}

It's used for the manufacture of terminals and various parts of electric fittings.

\section*{ADVANTAGES}
i. It's harder than copper
ii. Its easily machined
iii. It can be readily cast
iv. It's easily tinned for soldering.

\section*{E] NICHROME}

It's used for the manufacture of fixed and variable resistors and heating elements.

\section*{F] MANGANIN}

It's a high quality resistance wire, expensive and requires special heat to develop its good properties and it's used mainly for precision resistors as used in the laboratories.

\section*{G] TUNGSTERN}

This has a very high melting point so is used in the manufacture of electric lamp filaments.

\section*{H] CARBON}

It's not a metal but it's a fairly good conductor and its physical properties make it very suitable for use as brushes in electrical machines. Carbon can be mixed with clay and other materials for the manufacture of carbon composition resistors which are widely used in radio and electronic equipment.

\section*{INSULATORS}

Any material which does not allow the free passage of an electric current is known as insulator.

Insulators are used to confine electric currents to the conductors in which they are intended to flow and to prevent leakage of electricity to adjacent
conducting materials which are not intended to become 'alive'. Insulation is also needed to prevent 'short ccts' btwn various parts of an installation. Some insulating materials commonly used as insulators are:

\section*{A] Rubber}

Widely used for covering wires and cables.

\section*{ADVANTAGES}
i. Good insulator
ii. Impervious to water
iii. Flexible

\section*{DISADVANTAGES}
i. Its adversely affected by sunlight
ii. It's not fireproof

\section*{B] POLY-VINLY CHLORIDE [P.V.C]}

It's a modern thermoplastic material which is often used as an alternative to rubber.

\section*{Advantages}
i. It resists chemical action and direct sunlight
ii. Not so inflammable

\section*{Disadvantages}
i. Has less degree of mechanical protection as rubber
ii. More expensive than rubber
iii. Cannot be used where temperatures exceeds $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{C] PAPER}

Impregnated paper is often used to insulate the conductors in underground cables and must be protected from the ingress of moisture.

\section*{D] MINERAL INSULATION}

Magnesium oxide is used as insulation in the certain types of cables. It is extremely heat resistance but must be protected against ingress of moisture.

\section*{E] MICA}

Used for insulation where high temperatures are involved e.g. heating elements. It is also used for insulation between the copper segments of the commutators of electrical machines.

\section*{Disadvantages}

Its brittle

\section*{F] ASBESTOS}

Used to insulate connecting leads where high temperatures are involved.

\section*{G] PAXOLIN}

Used for insulating panels and barriers in switchgears.

\section*{H] BAKELITE}

Used for moulded insulating parts of electrical fittings.

\section*{CABLES}

A cable is a length of insulated conductor solid or stranded of two or more of such conductors each provided with its own insulation which are laid 2gether. A cable consists of three parts namely:
- Conductor
- Insulation
- Mechanical protection

\section*{INSULATION}

Insulation of cables used in domestic installations is normally vulcanized [VRI] or p.v.c

Insulators where mineral is employed the cable has a copper outer sheath and this type of cable is known as mineral insulated metal sheathed cable [M.IC.S]

\section*{MECHANICAL PROTECTION}

It is provided to prevent damage to the cable during installation and throughout its subsequent service. It must be non - absorbent and also must be able to withstand:
> Mechanical stresses e.g. compression.
> High temperatures.
$>$ Corrosive effects of chemicals.
The common types of protection are:
Sheathing: sheathing materials used vary considerably and are associated with the type of material used for the conductor installation. Examples include: tough rubber, lead alloy, polyvinylchloride, metal [copper alminium].

Armouring: it is the wrapping of metal usually with wire or tape metals used include steel or alminium.

\section*{CONDUCTORS}

They are usually made of copper the conducting cores being formed from strands of copper wire so that the cable is more flexible than if solid were used. If vulcanized rubber insulation is used the cu conductors are tinned to prevent corrosion of the cu by sulphur which is present in vulcanized rubber. The size of cables used in domestic installations is normally stated as no. of
strands/diameter of each strand e.g. a cable commonly used for lighting cct is 3/0.029 meaning it consists of three strands and each strand is 0.029 in diameter.

\section*{NB:}

For larger types of cable, the effective $x$-sectional area of the core is often quoted as the size.

Some commonly used cables sizes are:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Nominal $\quad \mathrm{x}-$ sectional area[mm ${ }^{2}$ ] & & No. and dia.[mm] & Current Rating[Amp] & Application \\

\section*{TYPES OF CABLES}

Cables can be grouped according to their applications in electrical work. These groups include:
> Wiring cables; this includes switchboard wiring, farm wiring, domestic and workshop.
> Power cables: heavy cables generally, lead sheathed and armored control cables for electrical equipment.
> Overhead cables: bare, light insulated and insulated conductor of copper, copper- cadmium and alminium.
> Communication cables: this group includes television down lead and radio relay cables and telephone cables.
> Welding cables: these are flexible cables and heavy cords with either copper or alminium conductors.
> Electric sign cables p.v.c and rubber insulated cables for high voltage discharge lamps. They are able to withstand the high voltage
> Equipment wires; they are special wires for use with instruments often insulated with special materials such as silicon, rubber and irradiated polythene.
> Appliance wiring cables: its group includes high temperature cables for electric radiators and cookers. The insulation used includes nylon asbestos and varnished cambric.
> Heating cables: cables for floor warming road, soil warming, ceiling heating and similar applications.

Flexible cable it is a cable consisting of one or more cores each containing a group of wires, the diameters of the wires and the construction of the cable being such as to afford flexibility.

Flexible cord it is a flexible cable in which the $x$ sectional area of each conductor does not exceed $4 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. Flexible cables are available in many sizes and types the most common are,
- Twin twisted; this consist of two single insulated stranded conductors twisted together to form a two core cable. Color identification is red and black. The insulation used is vulcanized rubber or p.v.c .the rubber is protected by a braiding of cotton, glazed cotton and artificial silk.
- Three core; they are similar to twin twisted but are provided with a third conductor colored green for earthing.
- Twin circular; this flexible cord consists of two conductors twisted together with cotton filter threads colored brown and blue, and enclosed within a protective braiding of cotton or nylon.
- Three core circular; like twin core circular except that the third conductor is colored green and yellow for earthing purposes.
- Four core circular; they are like core circular the colors are brown and blue.
- Parallel twin; they are two stranded conductors laid together in parallel and insulated to form uniform cable with rubber or p.v.c.
- Twin - core[flat]; this consist of two stranded conductors insulated with rubber colored red and black laid side by side and braided with artificial silk.
- Flexible cables; these cables are made with stranded conductors the diameters being 0.3 mm 0.4 mm 0.5 mm 0.6 mm .they are generally used for trailing cables and similar applications where heavy currents are to be colored for instance to welding.

\section*{CABLE RATINGS AND SIZES}

The current rating of a conductor is the maximum current that it can carry continuously without undue heating. The temperature rise of a
conductor depends on both the amount of current flowing and the installation environment therefore the current rating of a particular size conductor varies.

When selecting the size of cable to be used in a particular cct there are two IEE requirements that should be met.
i) The cable must be able to carry the maximum current liable to flow in the cct without undue heating
ii) The voltage drop from consumers point to any point in the installation shall not exceed $2.5 \%$ of the declared or nominal voltage when the conductors are carrying the full load current disregarding starting conditions.

\section*{Factors affecting the current rating of a cable;}

Ambient temperature; this is the temperature in the vicinity of the cables or it's the temp of the surrounding medium under normal conditions in which cables are or to be installed including the effect of artificial heating used in the building and any local source of heat but not an increase of temperature in the neighborhood of cables.

Type of excess current protection; current rating of cables insulated with p.v.c or synthetic rubbers are determined not only by the maximum conductor temperature admissible for continuous running but also by the temperature likely to be attained under conditions of excess current. There are two types of excess current protection namely;
i) Close excess current protection; this is excess current protection which will operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the cct it protects. The devices
includes; Fuses which have fusing factor not exceeding 1.5 and m.c.bs which are set to operate to an overload not exceeding 1.5 times the designed load cct.
ii) Coarse excess current protection; This type of excess current protection which will not operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the cct which it operates. Devices offering coarse excess current protection are BS 88 fuses. Semi enclosed [rewirable] fuses complying with BS3036.

Grouping of ccts; the no of ccts running in the same enclosure e.g. trunking, conduits cables carrying the same current rating are bunched and when laid 2gether they add heat to one another therefore group factor is used.

Disposition; position relative to other conductors and surfaces e.g. when cables are laid together in underground the temperature around them rises.

Type of insulation and sheath; e.g. sheathed multiple cores can be considered as a no. of cable tightly bunched together.

The current rating of various types of cables installed in particular conditions are listed in IEE tables multiplied by an appropriate rating factor which is determined by considering the ambient temperature.

In many cases it is unlikely that all the apparatus connected to a cot will be switched on at the same time thus the maximum current that the conductor will actually have to carry will be less than the total possible current which would flow if all the apparatus were switched on simultaneously therefore the flow of current varies and we have a factor known as diversity factor which is given by

\section*{Actual maximum current}

Total current required for all apparatus combined

Or use a table for diversity.

\section*{Example I}

A corridor 96 m long is to be lighted by 240 v 60 w lamps spaced 12 m apart and controlled by one switch at the supply end. The wiring is to be single core P.V.C insulated cables enclosed in metal conduit. Find the size of wire required.

Sol:
No. of lamps 96/12 =8
Current per lamp I $=P / V=60 / 240=0.25 \mathrm{~A}$
Maximum current $=0.25 \times 8=2 \mathrm{~A}$
The current distribution is marked on the diagram below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-22.jpg?height=512&width=1577&top_left_y=1583&top_left_x=194)

The allowable volt drop is $2.5 \%=240 \times 2.5 / 100=6 v$
Ref to the table column 3and 4 shows that a cable $1.0 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ [1/1.13] has a v.d per ampere per metre run of 40 Mv and a current rating of 11 A . The cable
carries 2 A , the v.d will vary at each lighting point and the calculations are as shown below;
$$\begin{aligned}
& A B=40 \times 2 \times 6=480 \mathrm{mv}=0.48 \mathrm{v} \\
& B C=40 \times 1.75 \times 12=840 \mathrm{mv}=0.84 \mathrm{v} \\
& \mathrm{CD}=40 \times 1.5 \times 12=720 \mathrm{mv} \\
& \mathrm{DE}=40 \times 1.25 \times 12=600 \mathrm{mv} \\
& \mathrm{EF}=40 \times 1.0 \times 12=480 \mathrm{mv} \\
& \mathrm{FG}=40 \times 0.75 \times 12=360 \mathrm{mv} \\
& \mathrm{GH}=40 \times 0.50 \times 12=240 \mathrm{mv} \\
& H J=40 \times 0.25 \times 12=120 \mathrm{mv}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\text { Total }=3.84 v \text { which is less than } 6 v \text { therefore the cable chosen }$$
is of suitable size.

\section*{Example II}

A room is warmed by a 2.4 Kw heater which consists of two ccts together in one conduit. The length of the room is 23 m and the supply is 240 v single phase and the wiring is single core p.v.c insulated cables drawn in conduit. Find the required size of cable to comply with IEE regulations.

\section*{Sol;}

Load current $=2400 / 240=10 \mathrm{~A}$
Allowable v.d $=6 \mathrm{v}$
Ref table column 3 and 4
Cable $1.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}[1 / 1.38]$ has a current rating of 13 A and $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d} / \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{m}$ of 27 mv .

The group rating of two pairs of two pairs cable is 0.8 therefore the current rating of this cable is $13 \times 0.8=10.4 \mathrm{~A}$. This is large enough to carry current of 10A

The $v . d=27 \times 10 \times 23 / 1000=6.21 v$ which is greater than the allowable v.d therefore the next cable is chosen which is $2.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ [1/1.78] with current rating of 18 A and $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d}$ of 16 mv . the current rating with the grouping factor of 0.8 will be
$18 \times 0.8=14.4 \mathrm{~A}$ therefore the $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d}=16 \times 10 \times 23 / 1000=3.68 \mathrm{v}$
The $v . d$ is within the limit of 6 v thus this cable will be suitable.

\section*{Example III}

A P.V.C insulated and sheathed twin cable of 20 m run supplies current from the switchboard in the domestic premises to a 6 Kw 240 v cooker which incorporates a s/o in the control unit. Find the minimum size of cable to comply with the IEE regulations.

Sol;
V.d allowable $=2.5 \%$ of $240=6 \mathrm{v}$

Load current $=6000 / 240=25 \mathrm{~A}$
Since it cooking appliance diversity is allowed therefore
First 10A of rated current $=10 \mathrm{~A}$
$30 \%$ of the remainder $=30 / 100 \times 15=4.5 \mathrm{~A}$
For s/o = 5A
Total $=19.5 \mathrm{~A}$
Since a twin cable is used col $7 \& 8$ are used and a cable of $2.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} 1 / 1.78$ with a current rating of 23 A and $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d} / \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{m}$ of 16 mv therefore

The v.d $=16 \times 19.5 \times 20=6.24 v$
$$1000$$

This drop is greater than 6 v therefore choose the next cable which is $4 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 30 A and a v.d of $10 \mathrm{mv} / \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{metre}$. Then the v.d is 10 x $19.5 \times 20=3.9 \mathrm{v}$.

This cable is suitable since the volt drop is within the allowable limit of 6 v .

\section*{Example IV}

A 7 kw 240 v electrical load is fed from a single phase supply 38 m away. The installation is done using p.v.c sheathed twin with earth enclosed in conduit and the ambient temperature is $40^{\circ}$ coarse excess current protection. Find the size of the cable required for the installation to comply with IEE regulations.

Sol;
Max permissible v.d $=6 \mathrm{v}$
Load current $=p / v=7000 / 240=29 \mathrm{~A}$
Cable chosen is from col $3 \& 4$ size is $6 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with current rating of $31 \mathrm{~A} \& \mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d}$ 6.8 mv at $40^{\circ}$ current rating $=0.94$

Amended current $=31 \times 0.94=29.14 \mathrm{~A}$
v.d $=\underline{6.8 \times 29 \times 38}$
$1000=7.4936 \mathrm{v}$ which is greater than 6 v a more larger cable is used

Which is $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with 4 mv
$$\begin{aligned}
v . d=\frac{4 \times 29 \times 38}{1000}=4.408 . \text { Therefore the cable is } 10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example V}

A conductor 40 m long supplied by 240 v single phase is to feed a 6 kw water heater. If the wiring is single core p.v.c insulated copper and enclosed in a conduit, the protection offered is close excess and the ambient temperature $40^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$. Calculate the appropriate cable size that is suitable for this installation.

Max permissible voltage drop is $2.5 \%$ of $240=6 \mathrm{v}$
Load current $=\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{v}=6000 / 240=25 \mathrm{~A}$
From the table the cable size is $6 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 31 A and a v.d of 6.8 mv

Rating factor temperature $40^{\circ}$ is 0.87
Protection is close 1.33
Combine rating factors $=1.33 \times 0.87=1.571$
Amended current $=31 \times 1.571=35.87 \mathrm{~A}$
v.d $=6.8 \times 25 \times 40$
$1000=6.8 \mathrm{v}$ which is more than the required 6 v therefore the next cable is chosen which is $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 42 A and a v.d of 10 mv . The v.d is $4 \times 25 \times 40$
$1000=4 \mathrm{v}$ and it 's less than 6 v therefore the correct cable size is $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.

\section*{Example VI}

A conductor 30 m long is to supply a 7.68 kw electric motor which is single phase, the ambient temperature is $55^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ and the protection offered is coarse excess current protection. The cable for the motor is to be drawn together
with other two ccts in a p.v.c. conduit. All the cables are p.v.c insulated non armored single core copper. Find the size of the cable which will be used to install and meet the v.d requirements.

Sol:
Permissible drop is 6 v
Load current is $\underline{7.68 \times 1000}$
$$1000=32 \mathrm{~A}$$

Rating factors temp $=0.77$
Grouping $=0.69$
Combined R.F $=.77 \times 0.69=0.531$
From the tables cable chosen is $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 42 A and v.d of 4mv

The amended current $=42 \times 0.531=22.3 \mathrm{~A}$.
This current is less than the load current therefore the next cable is selected which is $16 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 56 A and $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d}$ of 2.6 mv .

The amended current is $56 x 0.531=29.74 \mathrm{~A}$.
Still its less than the load current therefore the next cable which is $25 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 73A and v.d of 1.6 mv .

The amended current is $73 \times 0.531=38.76 \mathrm{~A}$

The v.d is $1.6 \times 32 \times 30$
$1000=1.54 \mathrm{v}$ which is less than 6 v
The appropriate cable size is $25 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.

\section*{Example VII}

A single phase supply is used in a domestic house to supply load. The total current demand is 28 A and the cable used is p.v.c non armored single core clipped directly on the surface. The protection to be offered is close excess current protection and ambient temperature is $50^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$. the total no. of ccts in the installation is 5 . Calculate the appropriate size of cable required for the installation.

\section*{Sol:}

Current demand is 28A
The size chosen is $4 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 30 and v.d of 10 mv
The rating factor is $1.33 \times 0.71=0.9443$
Grouping the R.F $=0.9443 \times 0.59=0.557$
The permissible drop is 6 v
The amended current is $0.557 \times 30=16.71$ which is less than the load current therefore next cable is chosen which is $6 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 38 A and a v.d of 6.8 mv

Amended current is $0.557 \times 38=21.2 \mathrm{~A}$ which is still less than the load current therefore the next cable which is $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a current rating of 51 A and $\mathrm{v} . \mathrm{d}$ of $4 m v$.

The amended current is $0.557 \times 51=28.41$
V.d is $4 \times 28 \times 1$
$1000=0.112 \mathrm{v}$ which is less than 6 v .
The appropriate cable is therefore $10 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.

2. In a two wire installation connected to a source of supply having either pole to the earth every switch, cct breaker shall be fitted in both poles.

\section*{Joint box}

This is a box in which conductors of cables are jointed. They are available in various forms. They have knock cuts for cable entry and are provided with lids of screw.

Plugs and socket outlets: These are required to enable portable apparatus to the final ccts. The s/o is the fixed portion connected to the fixed wiring and comprises of two or three conduct tubes and terminals. The plug is connected
to the apparatus by a flexible wire and comprises of two or three contact pins to fit the contact tubes or the s/o. the plug may be fused or not.

The boards are usually metal cased or hard wood cased. The case is fitted with an earthing terminal. It contains a fuse bank on the live side. Neutral wire is connected to the neutral bar. The LEE reg require that the neutral conductor for different currents should be connected in the same order as the live conductor.

\section*{Consumer control unit [CCU]}

In a single phase installation whose current rating is not greater than 60A, the consumers' main switch and other fuses may e combined with the distribution board as one unit. This unit is known as consumers control unit.

\section*{Fuses and cct breakers [under protection]}

\section*{WIRING SYSTEM}

A wiring system is an assembly of parts used in the formation of one more electric ccts. It consists of a conductor together with its insulation its protection against mechanical damage [sheathing or armoring] certain wiring accessories for fixing the system, joining and terminating the conductors.

Good workmanship; a good workman is the technician who does produce a good looking, neat jo with his tools, and the result of the sound and considered application of theory.

\section*{Factors to consider when choosing the wiring system.}
- Type of building; whether the installation work is for permanent or temporary building or for extension to an existing building.
- Installation conditions; whether the installation is likely to be subjected to mechanical damage, moisture, fumes, weather, abnormal or subnormal temperatures, inflammable or explosive dust, gas or vapor.
- Flexibility ; whether the wiring system must be one which will allow it to be easily extended or altered at some time in the future.
- Appearance; whether the building is such that the electrical installation must be hidden or its appearance can be allowed e.g. in an electrical workshop surface run conduits is not out of place but would be awkward in offices.
- Durability; whether the installation is to last for the time of the life of the building or not.
- Cost; whether the amount of money available for the electrical installation part of the building is restricted or not.
- Safety; depends on the installation conditions type of the supply and the earthing arrangements available.

\section*{WIRING SYSTEM 1}

This system includes all wiring which use sheath as its mechanical protection. There are several types depending on the material used for sheathing they are;
$>$ Tough rubber sheath [TRS] its termed as an all insulated system because the sheath is of an insulating material. The insulation material is vulcanized rubber and the sheath is tough rubber. The cable is available in single core, flat twin three core and twin with cct protective conductor [cpc].

Advantages: it's cheap
It's flexible
It's easy to install
Disadvantages; rubber is weak to withstand severe mechanical damage Rubber is affected by oil

Limited to ambient temperature [tends to harden at high temperature]
> Polyvinylchloride [PVC] its also an all insulated wiring system where both the insulation and sheath are p.v.c. Available as single core, flat twin with earth and 3 core with earth.

Advantages; less affected by oil Has less insulation resistance

Disadvantages; p.v.c softens when warmed therefore excluded in a number of installation applications.
> Polychloroprene sheathed [p.c.p] : The cable consist of conductors insulated with vulcanized and sheathed with p.c.p which is a tough rubber like substance. This form of plastic material is suitable for farm wiring where steam, ammonia fumes, lactic acid and milk fats, sulphur fumes, direct sunlight and heat is likely to be encountered.

LEAD ALLOY SHEATHED [LAS]: this system consists of conductors which are insulated with vulcanized rubber, taped and sheathed with a lead alloy. The lead sheath can be used as a cct protective conductor therefore must be continuous throughout the installation by soldering or bonding with clamps and also it protects against mechanical damage.

Disadvantages: the lead sheath is very soft material and can be damaged severely by blows from any hard object.

LAS cables are liable to corrosion where they come into contact with lime in damp situations.
> MINERAL INSULATED METAL SHEATHED [MIMS]: These cables consist of alminium conductors contained in a copper or alminium sheath, the insulant is compressed mineral magnesium oxide. The most common type is MICS which are impervious to water and oil and immune from condensation therefore does not require further protection even against high temperatures and fire. The conductor sheath and the insulant are inorganic the cable is virtually ageless. During installation the ends of cable must be sealed off against the ingress of moisture by special terminations.

Advantages: the cable has good heat resisting properties.
Has a higher current rating than P.V.C, TRS or PILC

Offers an excellent self-contained CPC since the sheath is copper or alminium.

Application: for industrial and hazardous areas.

\section*{HOUSE SERVICE OVEHEAD SYSTEM [HSOS]}

The conductors of this wiring system are insulated with vulcanized rubber and tapped. The cores of the cable are then varnished and calico tapped. The whole is braided and coated with weather resisting compound. This type of cable is used for consumer's distribution wiring between buildings. They are found either fixed or supported by a catenary wire between buildings.

\section*{WIRING SYSTEM II}

This includes all the wiring systems which have prefabricated sections. They include: conduit, trunks and ducts.

\section*{CONDUITS}

The conduits may be metallic or non-metallic. In both they are of two types i.e. light and heavy gauge.

\section*{Metallic conduits}
i. Steel conduits: the light gauge conduit is produced from steel strip which is formed into a tube. This type of conduit has an open seam and is only used for small installation at or below 250 v . The light construction of the tube makes it unsuitable for bending. There are two types of fittings which are supplied for use with this type of conduit which are:
lug grip: paint is cleaned at the end of the conduit to ensure electrical continuity and the fitting is connected to the conduit by tightening two brass screws.

Pin grip: continuity is obtained in this type by tightening hardened steel screw into the grip conduit at each fitting.

There are two types of the heavy gauge conduits: Heavy gauge welded: this is formed from two strips of heavy gauge sheet steel and is welded at the seam. This is the most common type of conduit and is used in sizes from 16 mm to 32 mm outside diameter.

Solid drawn conduit: this is produced by a heated bar over a ram forming a heavy gauge seamless tube. This type of conduit is more expensive than welded steel heavy gauge conduit and is only used for flame proof condition. The finishing's used are:
- Black enamel for internal use in dry situations.
- Silver grey finish for internal use in dry situations where the conduit is required to match decorations.
- Hot galvanized or stainless steel for external use where the conduit will be subjected to dampness or condensation.

Because solid drawn conduit is more expensive than the seam welded its use is generally restricted to gas tight and explosion proof installation. Welded seam conduit is used generally for moist wood installation.

\section*{Advantages of steel conduits:}
> Provides protection against mechanical damage.
$>$ Provides earth continuity conductor ECC
> It is durable in that if properly installed it lasts for years without maintenance.
$>$ It can be easily extended.
> It has low fire.

\section*{Disadvantages of steel:}
$>$ It is more expensive than p.v.c
$>$ It is difficult to conceal
$>$ It is reliable to corrosion.

\section*{COPPER CONDUIT}

Copper conduit resists corrosion and is an excellent ECC. The system is expensive but has extremely long life. Conduits are screwed in normal manner through connection to accessories associated with the system. It can be soldered and bronze junction boxes are used.

\section*{ALMINIUM CONDUIT}

Though in some ways its inferior to steel conduit but it has found its own application because of its light weight easy in working with and suitable to tropical conditions. It is a screwed end conduit and because its resistivity is only a little higher than that of copper it offers excellent earth continuity facilities. It is not strong mechanically and may require further protection where the risk of mechanical damage is high.

\section*{FLEXIBLE CONDUITS}

Flexible conduits are generally used for the final connection to machinery e.g. electrical motors and where vibrations and the need to adjust the position of equipment make a rigid conduit connection unsatisfactory.

Flexible conduits can also be deal with the need for complicated twists and bends. It is used for short runs where mechanical damage is less likely to occur. The conduit is not an acceptable ECC a separate ECC must be run between the
special brush adaptor used to join the flexible conduit to the ordinally screw conduit to the ordinary screw conduit. Sizes available are from 8 mm to 50 mm internal diameter.

\section*{NON METALLIC CONDUITS}

There are two main types:
- Flexible type which comes in both round and oval section and it is supplied in seven metre coils.
- The rigid type which is supplied in a standard length of 4metres. The light gauge can be bent without tools but bending spring or sand is inserted to prevent it from collapsing at the bends. The heavy gauge is the commonly used and is made of materials which vary widely but the most common is p.v.c and is installed with phenolic moulded fittings which closely resemble the steel conduit range. Fixing is by saddles or clips.

\section*{Advantages of p.v.c conduits:}
* Absence of fire risk due to breakdown in continuity.
* Easy manipulation without the use of special tools.
* Resistance to corrosion from most industrial liquids.
* No internal condensation takes place.

\section*{IEE reg}
- The conduit installation must be completed b4 cables are drawn in.
- A space factor of $40 \%$ is allowed in conduit system
- The radius of bend in a circuit should not be greater than 2.5 times the outside diameter of the conduit.
- The ends of a conduit must be filed or reamed to provide damage to the cable.
- Conduit installed in damp conditions must have a water resistance finish e.g galvanized
- Extra low voltage and high voltage cables must not be run in the same conduit.
- Metal conduits should be kept separate from gas and water serving conduit which is likely to come into contact with other services should be bounded to those services.
- All metal conduits must be effectively earthed and all joints must be mechanically and electrically sound and continuous.
- Drainage points should be provided at the lowest point in a conduit installation and in conditions where condensed moisture is likely to collect. Drainage points are not made in a gas tight system.
- Cable installed in explosive atmosphere must be enclosed in solid conduit unless they are metal sheathed.
- Metal conduits not requiring earthing are: - short isolated lengths used for mechanical protection - short exposed length used for the mechanical protection.
- Ducting of cables - outgoing and return cables must be run in the same conduit.

\section*{TRUNKING}

Trunking is available in square or rectangular sections ranging from 1.5 inches by 1.5 inch to 12 inch by 6 inch in cross section and in length of 2 m . Trunking is
a very rigid system i.e. cannot be bent or set around obstacles therefore a wide range of fittings are provided by manufacturers to enable bends to be negotiated. Such fittings include : elbows, tees, blank ends, bends of various radii and angles, couplers, four way boxes, fire resisting barriers, pin racks for vertical runs where cables are wound.

Earth straps are fixed at each section to ensure earth continuity along the trunking.

\section*{Forms of trunking}
$>$ Busbar trunking
> Flush trunking
$>$ Multi-compartment
> Skirt trunking
$>$ Lighting
> Cable tap trunking
> P.v.c trunking

\section*{BUS BAR TRUNKING SYSTEM}

It's a wiring system which consists of copper busbars supported on insulators and enclosed in steel trunking which is convenient for use where large currents have to be handled. Typical uses off this type of system are:
a) Vertical raising mains: It's often employed in a multi - storeyed building to carry the supply to each floor.

The incoming supply is connected to the bottom of the raising main and a suitable tap off point provided at each floor level. A common type of trunking used for this purpose consists of 300A copper busbars. Since in the event of a fire hot gases and flames would tend to travel up the trunking, fire proof barriers are fitted at each floor level. A typical fire barrier consists of a 2-3 inch
thick layer of glass wool supported by a hard asbestos board sheet and completely fills the trunking.

\section*{Overhead busbar system}

This system provides a convenient method of distribution in a factory or a large workshop. A typical system used to provide a $3 \phi$ supply has 'plug in' tap off points at 3 ft intervals into which a fused tap off box can be fitted which makes it easy to provide a supply position wherever it is required and can be readily changed if necessary. if long runs of busbars trunking are installed, it is necessary to provide expansion joints at approximately 100 ft intervals to allow for expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature. Fire barriers must be installed at suitable intervals particularly where trunking passes through walls or partitions to prevent the possible spread of fire along the trunking.

\section*{Flush trunking}

It fits flush with walls of which it entails a lot of builders work to install.

\section*{Multi - compartment}

It is provided with segregated compartments so that cables carrying different voltages can be accommodated in the same trunking unit.

\section*{Skirt trunking}

It is designed to take the normal place of the room skirting. It carries power, telephone and lighting cables in its various compartments. s/o can be easily fitted as an integral part of the trunking.

\section*{Lighting trunking}

It is designed for use where long rows of continuous lighting are required. The steel enclosure can carry fluorescent and or tungsten fittings, control gear and supply cables.

\section*{P.v.c trunking}

Used for lighting ccts mostly in extensions of buildings bell ccts and for telephone cables.

\section*{Cable -tap trunking}

It does not carry copper busbars but insulated supports which can accommodate VRI and P.V.C cables from which supplies to machines and lighting ccts are tapped through fused tap, off boxes.

\section*{Advantages:}
- It's much lighter than conduits of the same capacity
- Has fewer fixings
- Wiring is easier and quicker as cables are laid in instead of being drawn in.
- Erection time is reduced.
- Multi - compartment trunking is available where segregation of services is required.

\section*{Disadvantages:}

The initial cost of installation is quite high.

\section*{IEE REG:}
* Where cables are having different ratings are installed in the same enclosure all cables shall be deemed to have the lowest temperature rating.

Busbar trunking must trunking must not be installed in conditions where inflammable vapours are present.

Fire barriers must be installed inside the trunking when it passes through floors, walls and partitions. Floors, walls, and partitions must be made up with an incombustible material after the trunking has been installed.
* Allowance should be made for expansion in long sections e.g. by fitting copper braiding between sections.

All busbar trunking should be marked danger and voltage stated and lids must be securely fitted.
* Spacing factor must not exceed 45\%.

\section*{UNDER FLOOR DUCTS:}

The ducts are made of chemically inert non metallic fibrous material impregnated with a preservative bitumen compound.

The duct is semicircular in section with spigot and s/o laid on and sealed to sheets of impregnated asbestos with bitumen compound. Metallic boxes are provided as draw in boxes and junction boxes and include baffles [restraining device to control the movement of fluid or gas] and tunnels for the crossover of the wiring. The ducts are installed in the solid concrete floors during the erection of the building then the ccts are connected through surface conduits hence to distribution boards. The various ducts are arranged to feed ceiling points for the floor below and s/o for the floor above. Junction boxes are provided with cover plates fixed flush with the floor finish and since the ducting is laid out in straight lines btwn j.b it always possible to locate the runs. The duct system takes form of an intersecting grid so that every part of the floor area is within reasonable distance of the duct.

\section*{ADVANTAGES:}
- The major part of the accommodation for the wiring can be conveniently installed at an early stage during the construction of the building even though the exact positions of the outlets may not be known at that time.
- A concealed wiring system is provided, without the need for excessive long chases in the concrete floors.
- It is relatively easy to alter the positions of outlets if necessary e.g. in case of change of tenancy.

\section*{IEE REG:}
- The ducting system shall be sufficiently protected to prevent damage caused by the intended use of the floor.
- The ducting system shall be run in such a position that it is not liable to damage by contact with the floor or the ceiling or their fixings.
- Entries into the ducts must be protected from ingress of water. All covers should be securely fixed on completion.
- A maximum space factor of $35 \%$ must be ensured.
- Where ducts pass through walls or partitions, the hole should be plugged of fire resisting materials to the thickness of the building materials to avoid spread of fire.

\section*{WIRING SYSTEM III}

\section*{SPECIAL INSTALLATIONS:}

Special installations deals with wiring systems which have been developed to meet the requirements of specific installation condition or are a combination of types of wiring system I and II or are fairly common in use but are applied only in special circumstances.

\section*{A. BARE CONDUCTORS}

Bare conductors and or lightly insulated conductors are installed in buildings for the following purposes:
- earthing connections
- As the external conductors of earthed concentric wiring systems.
- protected rising main and busbar system
- The conductors of extra low voltage system.
- As collector wires for travelling cranes and trolleys.

Bare conductors passing through walls, floors, partitions or ceilings must be protected by enclosing them in a non-absorbent incombustible insulating material.

\section*{B. CATENARY SYSTEMS:}

The most common system of catenary wiring is that which uses a high tensile steel wire pulled taut between buildings, the cable is then run along the catenary wire being supported the same way. This system is also known as grid suspension system and consists of a central galvanized steel, high tensile stranded wire surrounded by a number of p.v.c insulated conductors and the whole is enclosed with p.v.c tape and p.v.c sheathing. Special connecting boxes are used at tees and right angled turns.

\section*{ADVANTAGES:}
- The system is completely water proof.
- Weight imposed on the building is reduced.
- Installation can be left until the building work is completed.
- Has reduced installation costs.

\section*{APPLICATIONS:}
- In industrial buildings band similar installations where other types of wiring systems would either be difficult or expensive to install.
- For overhead street lighting and in factories instead of an overhead busbar system where amount of power required for machines is small.

\section*{C. EARTH CONCENTRIC WIRING:}

This consists of one core tinned copper made up with an outer sheath of tinned copper .the function of the outer sheath is to act both as return conductor for the cct current and as a mechanical protection.

\section*{IEE REG:}
ii. Earth concentric system may only be used if its supplied by a tx and has no metallic connection with the public supply system on multiple earthing of the neutral has been approved.

\section*{D. CLEATED WIRING:}

The cleat system consists of V.R.I cable supported by plastic or porcelain cleats.

\section*{IEE REG:}
iii. The conductors in a cleated system must not touch one another or adjacent surfaces e.g. walls, ceilings e.t.c
iv. The conductors must be in view throughout their length and must be supplied with mechanical protection when they pass through walls.
v. Conductors must be terminated at a non-inflammable surface e.g. hard wood or block.

NB: this system is very cheap to install but is only used in conditions where it is not liable to damage from moisture or mechanical damage.

\section*{E. OVERHEAD SYSTEM:}

It's not an actual wiring system but an overhead cable which provide distribution of electrical energy btwn points of use and btwn buildings where there is some considerable distance btwn the main and control of supply and the point of use e.g. a farmhouse and a water pump a mile away.

\section*{F. TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS:}

A temporary installation is an installation with an expected period of service of three months. Any installation beyond this period should be completely overhauled at three month intervals.

\section*{IEE REG:}
vi. Every installation on a construction site, temporary installation other than in private dwelling house, shall be in charge of a competent person who shall be fully responsible for the safety and use of the installation and for any alteration or extension.
vii. The installation shall be inspected and tested at intervals of three months or less, as necessitated by the nature of the installation.

\section*{G. INSTALLATION IN HAZARDOUS AREAS}

There are three main types of hazards classified as follows:
1. Flammable liquids.
2. Explosive gases and vapours
3. Explosive dusts where flammable organic dusts e.g. sugar and flour or metallic dusts such as $\mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Al}$ are likely to be present.

Flammable gases and vapours encountered with industry are classified into:

Group I: Gases encountered in coal mining e.g. methane
Group II: Petrochemical gases e.g. propane butane pentane ammonia carbon monoxide etc

Group III: coal gas
Group IV: Acetylene and hydrogen.

\section*{POTENTIAL DANGER AREAS}

\section*{DIVISION 0}

This is an area in which flammable vapours are continuously present.
This is the most dangerous area and generally it is recommended that electric equipment should not be installed there.

If it is necessary to install electrical equipment then the system of electrical enclosures could be pressurized above atmospheric pressure so that no explosive vapours inbuilt pass into the electrical system. An alternative method would be to install the electric motor and its control gear outside the area and have the drive shaft coupled to the driven machine (in the hazardous area) via a flame proof seal in the dividing wall.

\section*{DIVISION I}

This is a less dangerous area than division o and flame proof equipment is installed.

Flame proof equipment is designed that it will withstand an internal explosion of the particular gas for which it is certified and also prevents any spark or flame from that explosion escaping from enclosure and igniting the surrounding atmosphere.

These areas may be wired in:
- Armored cable
- MICC cables with flame proof glands and for underground installations it should have a PVC oversheath.
- Single or multicore cables enclosed in solid drawn heavy duty conduit protected against corrosion. All conduit boxes and inspection fittings must be flame proof.

\section*{DIVISION 2}

This is less dangerous than division I areas where the equipment is unlikely to produce arc sparks during operation. It may be possible to install normal wiring systems with special attention to cable entries.

Regular testing must be carried out by competent personnel.
On mixed installation where there are hazardous and safe areas the electrical installation should revert from flame proof wiring to normal wiring systems provided that suitable sealing boxes are used.

These areas may be wired in:
- MICC with PVC oversheath for underground
- Single or multicore cables in heavy duty screwed and welded conduit.

\section*{ILLUMINATION [ELECTRIC LIGHTING]}

\section*{Introduction:}

Light is a form of radiant energy. Various forms of incandescent bodies are the sources of light and the light emitted in such bodies depend upon the temperature of bodies. When the body is red hot the wave length of radiated energy will be sufficiently large but the energy is in form of heat. When the temperature increases the body changes from red hot to white hot state, the wave length of the radiated energy becomes smaller and enters into the range of wavelength of light therefore hot bodies emit heat as well as light energy with its velocity being $3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The ratio of the energy emitted by the body in form of light to the total energy emitted by the body is known as the radiant efficiency of the body which depends upon the temperature i.e. the higher the temperature of the body the lower the wave length of the radiant energy and the higher the radiant efficiency.

\section*{Terms used in illumination:}

Light: it is the radiant energy from a hot body which produces the visual sensation upon human eye. It is expressed in lumen- hours.
* Luminous flux [Ф]: it is the quantity of light energy emitted per second from a luminous body measured in lumens.
* Luminous intensity [I]: it is the luminous flux emitted by the source per unit solid angle measured in the direction in which the intensity is required measured in candela [cd] or lumens per steradian.

NB//: solid angle $\omega$ is the angle subtended by an area at the centre of a sphere from a light source its unit is Steradian $\omega=1$ steradian which is defined as the angle subtended at the Centre of a sphere by part of its surface having an area equal to [radius] ${ }^{2}$ ]. The solid angle subtended by
the centre of the whole spherical surface $=4 \pi r^{2} / r^{2}=4 \pi$. Therefore $\omega=$ $4 \pi$.
$\mathbf{I = \Phi} / \omega$ cd or lumen per steradian.
* Lumen: it is defined as the amount of luminous flux given out in space represented by one unit of solid angle by a source having an intensity of one candle power in all directions. I.e. lumens = candle power x solid angle $=c p \times \omega$ for a source emitting 1 cd lumen $=4 \pi$.
* Candle power [cp]: it is the radiating capacity of a source in a given direction which is defined as the number of lumens given out by the source in a unit solid angle in a given direction. $\mathrm{Cp}=\mathrm{Im} / \omega$.

Illumination [E]: it's the number of lumens falling on the surface per unit area. It's measured in lumens per square metre or lux or metre candle. i.e. $\mathrm{E}=\Phi / \mathrm{A}$.
* Lux or metre candle: it is defined as the luminous flux falling per square metre on the square which is everywhere perpendicular to the rays of light from a source of one candle power and one metre away from it.
* Mean horizontal candle power [MHCP]: it is the mean candle power in all directions in the horizontal containing the source of light.
* Mean spherical candle power[MSCP]: It is the mean of candle power in all directions and in all planes from the source of light.
* Reduction factor: it is the ratio of its mean spherical candle power to its mean horizontal candle power. R.f $=$ MSCP/MHCP.
* Lamp efficiency: it's the ratio of the luminous flux to the power input expressed in lumens per watt.

Glare: it's the brightness within the field of vision of such a character as to cause annoyance, discomfort, interference with vision or eye fatigue.

Space height ratio: = horizontal distance between the two adjacent lamps

Mounting height of lamps above working plane

\section*{Utilization factor: = total lumens reaching the working plane Total lumens given out by lamp}

Maintenance factor: = illumination under normal working conditions
Illumination when everything is perfectly clean.
Depreciation factor: this is merely the inverse of the maintenance factor and its value is more than unity.

\section*{Laws of illumination}
i. Illumination of a surface E is directly proportional to the luminous intensity I of the surface i.e. E $\dot{\alpha}$ I
ii. Inverse square law: states that the illumination of a surface is inversely proportional to the a square of the distance of the surface from the source.
$$E \dot{\alpha} 1 / r^{2}$$
iii. Cosine law: illumination is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle by the normal to the illuminated surface with the direction of the incident flux. $\mathrm{E} \dot{\alpha} \cos \theta$ Combining all these factors we get $E=\frac{I \cos \theta}{r^{2}} \mathrm{Im} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$

\section*{Examples:}
A. Calculate the illumination on a working plane at appoint A $2 m$ vertically below a lamp emitting 720 cd when;
- The surface is at right angles with the light source
- Illumination at point $B$ which is $3 m$ from point $A$.

Sol:
$$E \dot{\alpha} I / r^{2}$$
$$\mathrm{E}=\underline{720}=180 \mathrm{~lm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$$

\end{aligned}$$
B. A lamp giving out 1000 lm in all directions is suspended 6 m above the working plane. Calculate the illumination at appoint on the working plane 4 m away from the lamp foot point.

Sol:
Luminous intensity $=1000 / 4 \pi=79.57$
$R \neq 6^{2}+4^{2}=7.2$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{Cos} \theta=4 / 7.2=0.55556 \\
& E=\frac{79.57 \times 0.5556}{7.2^{2}}=0.81951 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Calculation of total lumens required in an installation.
$$\text { Luminous flux }=\frac{\text { illumination required }\left[\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right] \times \text { area }\left[\mathrm{m}^{2}\right]}{\text { Maintenance factor } \mathrm{x} \text { coefficient of utilization }}$$

\section*{Example:}

A yard 25 m long by 6 m wide is to be illuminated to a level of $201 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The average lumen output of the lamp is $351 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{w}$, the maintenance factor is 0.8 and the coefficient of utilization is 0.5 calculate the total lamp power required and the number of lamps if the available lamps are rated 60 w .

Sol:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Luminous flux }= \underline{\text { illumination required }\left[\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right] \times \text { area }\left[\mathrm{m}^{2}\right]} \\
& \begin{aligned}
& \text { Maintenance factor } \times \text { coefficient of utilization } \\
&=\underline{20 \times[25 \times 6]} \\

\end{aligned} \\
& \text { Total watts required }=\underline{7500 \mathrm{~lm}}=214.3 \mathrm{~W} \\
& 35 \mathrm{Im}
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
\text { Number of lamps required }=214.3 / 60=4 l \mathrm{amps} .
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{SOURCES OF ELECTRIC LIGHT}

There are two main types of lamps namely;
> Incandescent lamps
> Discharge lamps.

\section*{Incandescent lamps:}

\section*{Principle of operation}

In this lamp light is produced by passing electric current through a conductor [usually tungsten] enclosed in an evacuated glass bulb. The operating temperature is over $2000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-59.jpg?height=1177&width=1671&top_left_y=862&top_left_x=238)

The efficiency of the lamp is approximately $121 m / W$. the efficiency of a lamp depends on
- The rating of the lamp i.e. the size.
- The age of the lamp.
- The operating voltage.

The efficiency of the lamp can be increased by:
* Filling the bulb with inert gas, usually argon. The gas allows an increased operating temperature of about $2500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ which gives increased light as it minimizes the losses from the filament due to evaporation. This also increases the life of the lamp to a minimum of 1000 hours.

Double coiling the filament which reduces the heat losses due to convection currents in the gas but the filament is operated at the same temperature.

\section*{Discharge lamps:}

\section*{Construction:}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-60.jpg?height=564&width=1234&top_left_y=1748&top_left_x=368)

\section*{Principle of operation}

When electrical pressure is applied across a glass tube containing neon gas an electrical discharge takes place and energy in form of light is given off. The gas under these conditions is said to be ionized. Ionization is caused by the movement of electrons in the gas which bombards the atoms of gas and free other electrons and light is given off during this bombardment. This process of ionization is started off by a high voltage being applied across the tube or the use of heated filaments in the lamp. The filaments are heated at the moment of starting and are coated with special oxide which emits electrons.

The flow of current through the tube increases with ionization and the following chain of reaction take place;
$\checkmark$ Increased ionization
$\checkmark$ Decreased resistance
$\checkmark$ Increased current
$\checkmark$ The cycle is repeated.

\section*{EARTHING AND PROTECTION PROTECTION}

It's carried out both on the installation and the user from the risk of electric shock or fire which may Occur under fault conditions.

\section*{Fire risk}

Fire risk in electrical installation can arise due to;

\section*{a] sustained overloading of wiring or equipment:}

Every circuit must have some form of over current protection which takes the form of a fuse or miniature circuit breaker [m.c.b].the over current device must be capable of disconnecting the supply safely in the event of the most severe fault that can arise i.e. short cct across its own outgoing terminals. The current rating of a fuse or C.B has inverse time xristics which operates in a time which is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the fault current.

\section*{B] Faulty contacts or connections:}

This can be avoided by the use of good quality accessories and fittings and by using correct methods of installation. NB//loose or poor contact can attain a very high temperature even though only a small current is flowing and the over current device gives no protection under these circumstances.

\section*{C] Earth leakage currents}

This can give rise to fire risks particularly if the earthing and bonding arrangements are not capable of carrying a sustained fault current without excessive heating. Danger arises from inadequate connections such as an earth clip which has worked loose a poorly made conduit connection or corrosion of parts of the earthing system.

\section*{Shock risk}

It arises whenever accidental contact is made btwn the live conductor and exposed metalwork. The risk can be guarded against either by efficient earthing or by employing earth leakage circuit breakers.

Protective devices include:

\section*{Fuses:}

Def: it's a device for opening a cct by means of a conductor designed to melt when excess current flows along it. Terms relating to a fuse:

Fuse element: it's that part of a fuse which is designed to melt and thus open the cct.

Catridge: an enclosure of the fuse element.
Fuse link: fuse contacts
Terms used in connection with fuses:
Current rating; this is the maximum current that a fuse will carry without undue deterioration of the fuse element.

Fusing current; this is the minimum current that will blow the fuse.
Fusing factor: this is the ratio of the fusing current to the current rating.
i.e. fusing factor $=$ fusing current

Current rating
There are three types of fuses namely:
Rewirable, catridge\$ HBC or HRC

\section*{REWIRABLE FUSE}

It consists of a porcelain bridge and a base. The base has to sets of contacts which fit into other contacts in the base. The fuse element usually tinned copper wire is connected btwn the terminals of the bridge and an asbestos
tube or pad is usually fitted to reduce the effects of arching when the fuse melts.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-64.jpg?height=540&width=915&top_left_y=621&top_left_x=542)

\section*{ADVANTAGES:}

It's simple and cheap

\section*{DISADVANTAGESVANTAGESANTAGES:}
- It's too easy for an inexperienced person to replace the fuse element with wire of incorrect gauge or type.
- Even when the correct wire is used for the fuse element the current rating and fusing factor may not be exactly as intended.
- There is often undue deterioration of the fuse element due to oxidation.
- Damage particularly in conditions of severe short cct.
- Lack of discrimination i.e. a momentary high current e.g. motor starting current and a continuous fault current.

\section*{CATRIDGE FUSE}

Its an advantages on rewirable fuse as the rating of a replacement element is determined by the manufacturer. The fuse carrier is designed so that its impossible to insert a fuse element of incorrect rating.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-65.jpg?height=392&width=997&top_left_y=615&top_left_x=398)

\section*{ADVANTAGES:}
- The rating is accurately known
- The fuse element is less prone to deteriorate.

\section*{DISADVANTAGES:}
- The fuse element is more expensive than the rewirable type.
- It is unsuitable for use where extremely high values of fault current may occur.

\section*{APPLICATION:}

Both rewirable and cartridge fuses are widely used for protecting domestic installations and smaller industrial loads.

\section*{HIGH RAPTURING CAPACITY FUSE [HRC]}

This overcomes the disability of rodinary fuses of destroying themselves in the event of a heavy overload.the fuse element here is a silver strip of special shape with a low melting point riveted in the centre. The strip is entirely sorrounded by chemically purified silica to prevent arc formation in the event that a fault current flows to operate the fuse. This overheating of the fuse and its surrounding is prevented. These fuses are often used to protect large
industial loads mains cables and in other situations where very large fault currents can occur.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-66.jpg?height=778&width=1309&top_left_y=519&top_left_x=325)

\section*{ADVANTAGES:}
- Its xristics can be designed to suit the nature of the load.
- It's capable to clear heavy currents safely.
- Easy to change.

\section*{DISADVANTAGES:}
- It's more expensive as compared to either rewirable or Catridge fuse.
- Relatively bulky.

\section*{MINIATURE CIRCUIT BREAKERS [M.C.B]}

They provide close excess current protection. A c.b is essentially a switch which may be;
- open and closed manually
- open automatically when overloaded.

Tripping xristics may be either magnetic or thermal. Protection against sustained over current is given by the bending of a bimetallic strip whereas high speed protection against short circuit is given by magnetic operation.

\section*{ADVANTAGES}
- The overload xristics are set by the manufacturer and cannot be altered.
- The xristics are such that the c.b will trip for small sustained overload but not on harmless transients overloads the operation is instantaneous when a short cct occurs.
- Faulty ccts can be easily identified.
- Supply can be quickly and easily restored when the fault has been cleared.

\section*{DISADVANTAGES}
> Must be checked from time to time to ensure that it will operate correctly where faulty occurs.
> Mechanism can become sluggish and unreliable if left unused for a long period.
$>$ Very much expensive than a fuse of the same rating.
$>$ More bulky than a fuse of the same rating.

\section*{EARTHING}

\section*{TERMINOLOGIES:}

Earth: a connection to the general mass of earth by means of an earth electrode.

Earthed: used to denote an object connected electrically to an earth electrode.
Solidly earthed: connected electrically to an earth electrode without a fuse, switch, circuit-breaker, resistor or impedance in the earth connection.

Earth electrode: a metal plate, rod or other conductor buried or driven into the ground and used for earthing metal work.

Earthing lead: the final conductor means of which the connection to earth electrode is made.

Earth-continuity conductor (ecc): the conductor including any clump connecting to the earth lead or to each other those parts of an installation which are required to be earthed. The ECC may be whole or in part of the metal conduct, the sheath of cables or the special continuity conductor of a cable or flexible cord incorporating such a conductor.

Live metalwork: an object is said to be live when - a difference in potential exists between it and earth or it is connected to common return or the neutral of a supply system in which is, not permanently and solidly earthed.

Continuous neutral earthing (CNE): when CNE system of earthing is used as a means of protection against earth faults in appliances in consumer's premises, the framework of such appliances is connected to the neutral wire of the supply authority's network.

Earth resistance: the ohmic resistance between an earth-electrode system and the general mass of the earth.

Earth resistivity: the resistance in ohms per cubic centimeter ( $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) of a sample of earth.

Bond: to connect together electrically two or more conductors.
Approximate values for soil resistivity:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Description & Ohm-cm \\
\hline Marshy ground & 200-350 \\
\hline Loam and clay & 400-15,000 \\
\hline Chalk & 6000-40,000 \\
\hline Sand & 9000-800,000 \\
\hline Pearl & 5000-50,000 \\
\hline Sandy gravel & 5000-50,000 \\
\hline Rock & 100,000 upwards \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Reasons for earthing}
1) To maintain the potential of any part of a system as a definite value w.r.t earth.
2) To allow current to flow to earth in the event of a fault so that the protective gear will operate to isolate the faulty connection.
3) To make sure that in the event of a faulty apparatus normally 'dead' cannot reach a dangerous potential w.r.t. earth.

\section*{IEE REG:}
- Where metalwork other than current -carrying conductors is liable to become charged with electricity in such a manner as to create a
danger if the insulation of a conductor should become defective or if a defect should occur in any apparatus the metal work shall be earthed in such a manner as will ensure immediate electrical discharge without danger.
- Every item of apparatus and every conductor shall be prevented from giving rise to earth-leakage currents by all insulated construction by double insulation, by isolation or by earthing of exposed metal ports.
- Extraneous fixed metalwork which cannot be effectively segregated from the metal work of the installation should be bonded to the earth- continuity conductor.
- The consumer's earthing terminal to which the earth-continuity conductor shall be provided near to the consumer's terminal.
- Consumers earthing terminal shall be bonded to the metal work of public gas and water services as near as possible to their points of entry into the premises.
- The C.S.A of every copper earthing lead shall not be less than $6 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ with a maximum size of $70 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ except for the earthing of a TX neutral or an electrode boiler which is $2.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.
- One point of the secondary winding and noncurrent carrying parts of the metalwork of any transformer shall be connected to the earth continuity conductor.

There are several methods used to achieve the earthing of an installation which include:

A] Connection to the metal sheath and armoring of a supply authority's underground supply cable. The provision of a cable sheath as an earth electrode connection is very common nowadays
but incase the earthing is proved ineffective the authority is not held responsible.

\section*{B] CONTINOUS EARTH WIRE [CEW]}

Connection to the continuous earth wire (CEW) provided by a supply authority where the distribution of energy is by overhead lines. CEW is not always provided by the authority except in those areas which have extremely high values of soil resistivity e.g. peat and rock.

\section*{C] Connection to an earth electrode sunk in the ground for the purpose.}

Connection to an earth electrode sunk in the ground is the most common means of earthing and the earth electrode can be in four forms:

\section*{i) Pipe}

It's a 200mm diameter cast-iron pipe, 2 metres long and buried in a coke-filled pit. It requires a certain amount of excavation to make the pit where the earth plate is installed and since iron is prone to corrosion especially if the coke has high content of sulphur it's highly insulated as shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-72.jpg?height=894&width=1580&top_left_y=701&top_left_x=244)
connected bitumen insulation
Cast iron earth plate

\section*{[li] Plate}

Plate electrodes are normally of cast iron buried vertically with the centre about one meter below the surface. (Copper may also be used).

The plate's electrodes provide a large surface area and are used mainly where the ground is shallow i.e. where the resistivity is low near the surface but increases rapidly with depth.

Excavation is also required and care is needed to protect the earth-electrode connection from corrosion.
i) Strip
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-73.jpg?height=495&width=952&top_left_y=375&top_left_x=244)

Copper strip is most useful in shallow overlying rock. The strip should be buried to a depth of not less than 50 cm .
ii) Rods

They are very economical and require no excavation for their installation. They are of standard lengths and made from hard drawn copper. They have a hardened steel tip and a steel driving cap. Sometimes the CU rod has a steel rod running through its centre for strength while it is being driven into rocky soil
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-73.jpg?height=855&width=1218&top_left_y=1743&top_left_x=376)

72

\section*{Advantages}
a) The buried length allows soil contact with the rod to be close and definite.

\section*{[D] CONTINOUS NEUTRAL EARTHING}

The CNE method gives protection against earth-fault conditions and uses the neutral of incoming supply as the earth point or terminal where all protected metalwork is connected by means of the installation ECC's to the neutral- service conductor at the supply- intake position. This makes line to earth faults converted to line- to neutral faults which ensures that sufficient current will flow under fault conditions to blow a fuse or trip an overload cb thus isolating the faulty connection from the supply.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-74.jpg?height=1007&width=1435&top_left_y=1364&top_left_x=239)

\section*{[E] PROTECTIVE MULTIPLE EARTHING (P.M.E)}

The principle of this system is that the earth continuity is connected to the neutral service conductor at the supply intake position and the neutral conductor is being connected to earth at regular intervals as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-75.jpg?height=777&width=1574&top_left_y=608&top_left_x=241)
bonded to neutral
multiple earth electrodes

\section*{Advantages}
i) There is low impedance path for fault current to flow via the neutral conductor.
ii) The impedance to earth is low even though individual earth impedance may be high since many earth connections are made in parallel.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) The shock risk that may arise if any earthed metal work associated with the system is not bonded to the neutral conductor or if the neutral conductor is broken.
ii) Earth currents may circulate between the multiple earth electrodes causing interference with telephone systems. There are two dangerous conditions when P.M.E is in use which are
a) Fault to earth metal work not bonded to neutral.
b) Broken neutral conductor and because of these inherent dangers which can arise with this system it is essential that the IEE reg concerning it are strictly observed some include:
- The use of this system must be authorized by the minister of power with the concurrence of the post master general (Reg 4 electricity supply Reg 1937)
- All premises supplied must be connected so as to use the P.M.E system of earthing.
- The maximum resistance from neutral to earth must not exceed 10R
- No fusible cut out, automatic CB, removable link or single pole switch shall be included in the neutral conductor.
- Earth continuity conductors must have a resistance of less than $1 / 20$ hm which must be tested by passing a current of not less than to 10A for a period of at least five minutes.

In general the above requirements limit the application of P.M.E to new networks since it is usually V , expensive to adapt all the installations connected to an existing network to meet all the necessary requirements.

\section*{[F] INSTALLATION OF AUTOMATIC FAULT PROTECTION}

It is obtained by use of earth leakage connection breakers which are of two forms.
> Voltage operated cct breaker:
They are designed to be directly responsive to fault voltages which appear on protected metalwork caused by earth leakage currents.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-77.jpg?height=803&width=1577&top_left_y=678&top_left_x=242)

This fault voltage is $\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{IR}$ where R is resistance of the earth, I the leakage current. They operate on currents as low as 50 mA and their operating time is too little e.g. BS 842 unit has less than one cycle. The trip coli is connected btwn protected metal work and earth in the same way a voltmeter is connected to measure the voltage btwn the earth and the metalwork. If a fault occurs, the current will flow through the trip coil to energize it and so trip the breaker contacts. Voltage operated E.L.C.B.S are used in domestic and small industrial installations to give protection against shock risk where good earth cannot be obtained.
$>$ Current operated ELCB
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_3796fc3865bd0a9bad1cg-78.jpg?height=678&width=1580&top_left_y=426&top_left_x=244)

The basic principle of operation depends upon more current flowing into the live side of primary winding than leaves the neutral or the return [earth] conductor. The essential part of it is a TX with opposed wdgs carrying the incoming and outgoing current. In a healthy cct where values of current in the wdgs are equal the magnetic effects cancel each other out but when a fault occurs it will cause an out of balance condition and create a magnetic effect In the $t x$ core which links with the turns of a small sec wdg. An e.m.f is induced in this wdg which is permanently connected to the trip coil of the c.b and causes a current to flow in the trip coil which energizes the coil to trip the breaker contacts.

\section*{INSTALLATION TESTING AND INSPECTION;}

\section*{Inspection:}

It's looking closely at the electrical work inorder to discover if there are defects which may cause the

Electrical installation becomes dangerous to human life e.g. a broken switch base, an exposed earth continuity conductor to mechanical damage. The electrical properties cannot be seen they can only be measured hence need for testing instruments.

The main purpose for installation testing is to detect faults before dangerous situations arise. The main factors against which an installation must be protected are:
i. Earth leakage
ii. Danger of electric shock
iii. Excess current, moisture and corrosion.
$>$ Testing should be carried out on new installations and on additions to existing installations.
> The official test that is carried out by the electricity supply authority before the installation is connected to the mains.
$>$ Periodically on existing installations to ascertain its condition.
The tests which are carried out are:
- Verification of polarity
- Insulation resistance test
- Continuity test
- Test of effectiveness of earthing.

\section*{VERIFICATION OF POLARITY:}

This is carried out to ensure that all fuses, single pole switches and centre connections of screw lamp are connected in the live conductor only. Also the outer contacts of lamp holder [Edison screw are connected in the neutral or earthed conductor and plugs, s/o are correctly wired.]

There are two methods of carrying out this test:

\section*{- Testing of polarity with cct live:}

Steps on how to carry out this test:
$>$ The consumers main switch should be ON
> All the switches should be ON
> All lamps should be out.
A test lamp is used. The end of one lead is connected to the earthed conductor or the neutral at the main switch, and the other lead is touched to the single pole switch terminals, fuse terminals and centre connections of screw lamp holders. The test lamp should light.

\section*{- Testing of polarity with cct dead:}

To carry out this test all fuses should be out, switches off, all lamps out and appliances out. One lead is connected to the phase of the outgoing side of the main fuse. The other lead is connected at the terminals of single pole switch in turn provided the polarity is correct, the instrument reading will be less than $1 \Omega$ since its measuring the resistance of the cct wiring. The instrument used is ohmmeter or bell set.

\section*{INSULATION RESISTANCE TEST}

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the quality of insulating material used in the installation is good. It ensures that there is no possibility of leakage currents flowing between insulated conductors and also btwn the conductors and the general mass of the earth.

This test is done in two ways:
> Btwn earth and all non earthed conductors connected together
> Btwn the live and neutral conductor.

\section*{Insulation resistance test btwn conductors and earth:}

\section*{Before testing:}
> Disconnect main supply by opening main switch and removing main fuses.
> Make sure that all lamps are in their holders.
> Place all switches in the ON position. See that all fuses are wired and insulated in their place in the D.F.B.
$>$ On incomplete installation the ends of conductor at each outlets points and switch position must be stripped and joined together.

\section*{Method:}

Join together the neutral and live terminals on the installation site of the main switch. The instrument used is a megger.

\section*{TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS OF EARTHING:}

The reasons for carrying out earthing tests are:
> To measure the resistance of the earth continuity conductor [metal conduit, trunking, and metal sheathed or the special conductor ECC] which connect to the earthing lead to those parts of an installation which requires to be earthed.
> To check that the earth continuity conductor is capable of clearing heavy leakage current.
$>$ To ensure that the earth electrode is effectively connected to the general mass of the earth.

\section*{Measuring the resistance of ECC:}

The instrument used is ohmmeter.

\section*{Method:}

Main supply should be off
Find the resistance of the ohmmeter leads [by shorting them]
Measure the resistance of the earth continuity conductor from the main supply to the furthest point of the installation.

The maximum allowable resistance on the installation using steel conduit is $0.5 \Omega$ for copper is $1 \Omega$ where copper ecc is used.

\section*{IEE REG FOR ECC:}
* Where separate ecc is used, the minimum allowable size is $1.0 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ and maximum of $70 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ but it must not be less than half the c.s.a of the conductor to be protected.
* All joints in the ecc must be mechanically and electrically sound and must be protected against corrosion.

\section*{Testing that the ecc is capable of clearing heavy current:}

It is achieved by injecting current in the earth continuity conductor. In this method an alternating current 1.5 times of the final subcct current or a maximum of 25A is injected through the ecc. The impedance should not be greater than $1 \Omega$.

Apparatus used are: a double wound TX 240 - 40v, an ammeter $0-30 \mathrm{~A}$, variable resistor and a voltmeter $0-50 \mathrm{v}$.

The instrument is used for testing the electrical continuity of conductors. The readings are in the low ohms range. They consist of a direct reading ohmmeter and a small dry battery usually 4.5 v flash type. The scale for continuity testing is from zero to $100 \Omega$ whereas that for insulation testing from zero to infinity.

\section*{EARTH TESTING INSTRUMENTS}

These instruments are used for testing the resistance of the earth electrode resistance area. The principle involved in the tests is that a current is passed thru the electrode under test and the earth to a distance auxiliary electrode. The potential is measured btwn the electrode under test and a central
potential electrode. The resistance is obtained by dividing the voltage reading thus obtained by the current flowing in the cct.

\section*{EARTH LOOP IMPENDANCE TESTERS}

They are used to measure the resistance of the earth fault loop. This comprise the line conductor from the point of fault back to the supply transformer, the path thru the $t x$ winding, the earthed neutral point of $t x$, the path from the consumers earth lead, the earth lead itself, and the earth continuity conductor to the point of fault.
