The most common type is MICS which are impervious to water and oil and immune from condensation therefore does not require further protection even against high temperatures and fire. The conductor sheath and the insulant are inorganic the cable is virtually ageless.

                                <p><strong>i. Steel conduits:</strong> the light gauge conduit is produced from steel strip which is formed into a tube. This type of conduit has an open seam and is only used for small installation at or below 250 v . The light construction of the tube makes it unsuitable for bending. There are two types of fittings which are supplied for use with this type of conduit which are:</p>

                                <p>There are two types of the heavy gauge conduits:</p>
                                <p><strong>Heavy gauge welded:</strong> this is formed from two strips of heavy gauge sheet steel and is welded at the seam. This is the most common type of conduit and is used in sizes from 16 mm to 32 mm outside diameter.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solid drawn conduit:</strong> this is produced by a heated bar over a ram forming a heavy gauge seamless tube. This type of conduit is more expensive than welded steel heavy gauge conduit and is only used for flame proof condition. The finishing's used are:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                <p>Because solid drawn conduit is more expensive than the seam welded its use is generally restricted to gas tight and explosion proof installation. Welded seam conduit is used generally for moist wood installation.</p>

                                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">COPPER CONDUIT</h4>
                                <p>Copper conduit resists corrosion and is an excellent ECC. The system is expensive but has extremely long life. Conduits are screwed in normal manner through connection to accessories associated with the system. It can be soldered and bronze junction boxes are used.</p>

                                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">ALMINIUM CONDUIT</h4>
                                <p>Though in some ways its inferior to steel conduit but it has found its own application because of its light weight easy in working with and suitable to tropical conditions. It is a screwed end conduit and because its resistivity is only a little higher than that of copper it offers excellent earth continuity facilities. It is not strong mechanically and may require further protection where the risk of mechanical damage is high.</p>

                                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">FLEXIBLE CONDUITS</h4>
                                <p>Flexible conduits are generally used for the final connection to machinery e.g. electrical motors and where vibrations and the need to adjust the position of equipment make a rigid conduit connection unsatisfactory.</p>
                                <p>Flexible conduits can also be deal with the need for complicated twists and bends. It is used for short runs where mechanical damage is less likely to occur. The conduit is not an acceptable ECC a separate ECC must be run between the special brush adaptor used to join the flexible conduit to the ordinally screw conduit to the ordinary screw conduit. Sizes available are from 8 mm to 50 mm internal diameter.</p>

                                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">NON METALLIC CONDUITS</h4>
                                <p>There are two main types:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The rigid type which is supplied in a standard length of 4metres. The light gauge can be bent without tools but bending spring or sand is inserted to prevent it from collapsing at the bends. The heavy gauge is the commonly used and is made of materials which vary widely but the most common is p.v.c and is installed with phenolic moulded fittings which closely resemble the steel conduit range. Fixing is by saddles or clips.</span></li>

                                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" style="margin-top:1.5em;">BUS BAR TRUNKING SYSTEM</h4>
                                <p>It's a wiring system which consists of copper busbars supported on insulators and enclosed in steel trunking which is convenient for use where large currents have to be handled. Typical uses off this type of system are:</p>
                                <p><strong>a) Vertical raising mains:</strong> It's often employed in a multi - storeyed building to carry the supply to each floor.</p>
                                <p>The incoming supply is connected to the bottom of the raising main and a suitable tap off point provided at each floor level. A common type of trunking used for this purpose consists of 300A copper busbars. Since in the event of a fire hot gases and flames would tend to travel up the trunking, fire proof barriers are fitted at each floor level. A typical fire barrier consists of a 2-3 inch thick layer of glass wool supported by a hard asbestos board sheet and completely fills the trunking.</p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">Overhead busbar system</h5>
                                <p>This system provides a convenient method of distribution in a factory or a large workshop. A typical system used to provide a $3\phi$ supply has 'plug in' tap off points at 3 ft intervals into which a fused tap off box can be fitted which makes it easy to provide a supply position wherever it is required and can be readily changed if necessary. if long runs of busbars trunking are installed, it is necessary to provide expansion joints at approximately 100 ft intervals to allow for expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature. Fire barriers must be installed at suitable intervals particularly where trunking passes through walls or partitions to prevent the possible spread of fire along the trunking.</p>

                                <p>It fits flush with walls of which it entails a lot of builders work to install.</p>

                                <p>It is provided with segregated compartments so that cables carrying different voltages can be accommodated in the same trunking unit.</p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">Skirt trunking</h5>
                                <p>It is designed to take the normal place of the room skirting. It carries power, telephone and lighting cables in its various compartments. s/o can be easily fitted as an integral part of the trunking.</p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">Lighting trunking</h5>
                                <p>It is designed for use where long rows of continuous lighting are required. The steel enclosure can carry fluorescent and or tungsten fittings, control gear and supply cables.</p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">P.v.c trunking</h5>
                                <p>Used for lighting ccts mostly in extensions of buildings bell ccts and for telephone cables.</p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold; margin-top:1em;">Cable -tap trunking</h5>
                                <p>It does not carry copper busbars but insulated supports which can accommodate VRI and P.V.C cables from which supplies to machines and lighting ccts are tapped through fused tap, off boxes.</p>
