The size of cables used in domestic installations is normally stated as no. of strands/diameter of each strand e.g. a cable commonly used for lighting cct is 3/0.029 meaning it consists of three strands and each strand is 0.029 in diameter.</p>

                        <p>The current rating of a conductor is the maximum current that it can carry continuously without undue heating. The temperature rise of a conductor depends on both the amount of current flowing and the installation environment therefore the current rating of a particular size conductor varies.</p>
                        <p>When selecting the size of cable to be used in a particular cct there are two IEE requirements that should be met.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors affecting the current rating of a cable;</h3>
                        <p><strong>Ambient temperature;</strong> this is the temperature in the vicinity of the cables or it's the temp of the surrounding medium under normal conditions in which cables are or to be installed including the effect of artificial heating used in the building and any local source of heat but not an increase of temperature in the neighborhood of cables.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type of excess current protection;</strong> current rating of cables insulated with p.v.c or synthetic rubbers are determined not only by the maximum conductor temperature admissible for continuous running but also by the temperature likely to be attained under conditions of excess current. There are two types of excess current protection namely;</p>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Close excess current protection;</strong> this is excess current protection which will operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the cct it protects.

                        <p><strong>Grouping of ccts;</strong> the no of ccts running in the same enclosure e.g. trunking, conduits cables carrying the same current rating are bunched and when laid 2gether they add heat to one another therefore group factor is used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disposition;</strong> position relative to other conductors and surfaces e.g. when cables are laid together in underground the temperature around them rises.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type of insulation and sheath;</strong> e.g. sheathed multiple cores can be considered as a no. of cable tightly bunched together.</p>
                        <p>The current rating of various types of cables installed in particular conditions are listed in IEE tables multiplied by an appropriate rating factor which is determined by considering the ambient temperature.</p>
                        <p>In many cases it is unlikely that all the apparatus connected to a cot will be switched on at the same time thus the maximum current that the conductor will actually have to carry will be less than the total possible current which would flow if all the apparatus were switched on simultaneously therefore the flow of current varies and we have a factor known as diversity factor which is given by</p>

                           $$ \frac{\text{Actual maximum current}}{\text{Total current required for all apparatus combined}} $$
