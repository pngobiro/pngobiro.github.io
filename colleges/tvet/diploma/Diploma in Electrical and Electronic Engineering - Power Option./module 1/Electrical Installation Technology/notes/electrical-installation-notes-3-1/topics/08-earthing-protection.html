                        <p>Fire risk in electrical installation can arise due to;</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">a] sustained overloading of wiring or equipment:</h4>
                        <p>Every circuit must have some form of over current protection which takes the form of a fuse or miniature circuit breaker [m.c.b].the over current device must be capable of disconnecting the supply safely in the event of the most severe fault that can arise i.e. short cct across its own outgoing terminals. The current rating of a fuse or C.B has inverse time xristics which operates in a time which is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the fault current.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">B] Faulty contacts or connections:</h4>
                        <p>This can be avoided by the use of good quality accessories and fittings and by using correct methods of installation. NB//loose or poor contact can attain a very high temperature even though only a small current is flowing and the over current device gives no protection under these circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">C] Earth leakage currents</h4>
                        <p>This can give rise to fire risks particularly if the earthing and bonding arrangements are not capable of carrying a sustained fault current without excessive heating. Danger arises from inadequate connections such as an earth clip which has worked loose a poorly made conduit connection or corrosion of parts of the earthing system.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Shock risk</h3>
                        <p>It arises whenever accidental contact is made btwn the live conductor and exposed metalwork. The risk can be guarded against either by efficient earthing or by employing earth leakage circuit breakers.</p>

                        <p>This overcomes the disability of ordinary fuses of destroying themselves in the event of a heavy overload.the fuse element here is a silver strip of special shape with a low melting point riveted in the centre. The strip is entirely sorrounded by chemically purified silica to prevent arc formation in the event that a fault current flows to operate the fuse. This overheating of the fuse and its surrounding is prevented. These fuses are often used to protect large industrial loads mains cables and in other situations where very large fault currents can occur.</p>

                        <p>The basic principle of operation depends upon more current flowing into the live side of primary winding than leaves the neutral or the return [earth] conductor. The essential part of it is a TX with opposed wdgs carrying the incoming and outgoing current. In a healthy cct where values of current in the wdgs are equal the magnetic effects cancel each other out but when a fault occurs it will cause an out of balance condition and create a magnetic effect In the tx core which links with the turns of a small sec wdg. An e.m.f is induced in this wdg which is permanently connected to the trip coil of the c.b and causes a current to flow in the trip coil which energizes the coil to trip the breaker contacts.</p>
