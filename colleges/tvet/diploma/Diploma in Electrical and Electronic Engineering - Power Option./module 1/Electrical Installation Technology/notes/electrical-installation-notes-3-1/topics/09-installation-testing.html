                        <p>These instruments are used for testing the resistance of the earth electrode resistance area. The principle involved in the tests is that a current is passed thru the electrode under test and the earth to a distance auxiliary electrode. The potential is measured btwn the electrode under test and a central potential electrode. The resistance is obtained by dividing the voltage reading thus obtained by the current flowing in the cct.</p>
