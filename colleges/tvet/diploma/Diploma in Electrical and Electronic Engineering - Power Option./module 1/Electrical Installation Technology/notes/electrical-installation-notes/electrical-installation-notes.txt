\section*{Safety}

Definition; -
$>$ Safety is defined as a state of being free from any risks e.g., injury, electric shock, fire, and damage of equipment's or machines.
$>$ If safety precautions are not observed then accidents are likely to occur which would result to the above-mentioned risks. Therefore, in any engineering field safety is of great importance.

\section*{Workshop safety regulations}

The following are some of the workshop safety precautions to be observed and also in electrical field: -
- Ensure that you understand instructions before starting any work. If you are in doubt please ask for clarifications.
- Use the right tools for the right task or job.
- Use tools which are in good conditions
- Keep gangways and access to fire appliances
- Know where the nearest fire exit is and what to do when there is an outbreak of fire.
- Learn how to give first aid treatment for electric shocks.
- Never ran in the workshop.

\section*{Safety in the electrical field or workshop}

With regard to safety in this field, it is that electricity is a good servant but a very bad master. For that reason, the electricians have to be good master in order to take full control of electricity safety. The following rules should be observed in any electrical work be it in installation to avoid electrical shocks and other associated accidents.
- When carrying out repair on any point of installation, put off the main switch that supplies that part.
- If not sure of what to do, it is advisable not to do it.
- Observe the color codes when terminating cables.
- Replace fuses with the right sizes of fuses.
- Avoid touching bare conductors or metallic parts with bare hands
- Don't touch electrical appliances with wet hands or when standing on wet ground.
- Don't not overload sockets outlets by plugging too many appliances in one outlet.
- Replace faulty electrical accessories immediately to avoid more serious accidents.
- Avoid making combustible materials from or near electrical appliances or sockets outlets.
- Put off immediately electrical appliances after use.
- Avoid using long trailing flexible cables or codes.
- Never use 2 pin plugs for a 3-wire flexible cable
- Never play near or climb electrical pythons.
- Avoid practical jokes in the workshop because electricity may cost your life.
- Avoid insertion of unauthorized materials in electrical outlets to avoid severe electrical shock.

\section*{Protective clothing}

Give reasons why we need protective clothing as engineers and electricians; -
i) $\quad \mathrm{To}$
ii) To
iii) To
iv) To
v) To

The protective clothing expected in the workshop for electrician are: -
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Part of the body & Protective clothing required \\
\hline Head & Helmet \\
\hline Eyes & Goggles \\
\hline Nose and mouth & Nose and mouth pad \\
\hline Hands & Hand gloves \\
\hline Feet & Heavy rubber soles shoes \\
\hline Whole body & Dust coat or overall \\
\hline Ears & Earpads \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Location and operations of safety equipment's}
i. First aid box

First aid kit should be placed in area whereby everybody can be able to access it when needs arise. These areas can be near the main workshop doors, on the working benches and any area which is visible to everyone in the workshop.

\section*{ii. Fire extinguisher}

These are very vital in a workshop; incase fire breaks out. They should be located in areas of ease accessibility to everyone and especially near the main doors and emergency doors. N/B- - everybody should know how to operate the available fire extinguishers.

\section*{Main causes of accidents}

These are the main causes of accidents in the workshop. Their include: -

\section*{i. Carelessness}

When any job is done, it often enough that it tends to become boring and boredom easily leads to careless work e.g., a maintenance electrician may continually check control equipment's when they are live and become unconscious of the danger.

\section*{ii. Ignorance}

Accidents often occurs on workshop due to ignorance and inexperience of the workers or students. Remember that most task looks easy when done by the experts. Do not attempt a difficult task unless under supervision

\section*{iii. Skylarking}

Skylarking may lead to serious and sometimes fatal accidents in a workshop. Many people may go to a workshop as a way of letting off stress without full realization of the hazards present.
iv. Drunkedness
v. Laziness
vi. Panic
vii. Lack of concentration
viii. Electric hazards e.g. electric shocks

Sources of danger
i. Portable equipment's and tools

Portable equipment's and tools are of greatest sources of multiple causes of serious accidents in an electrical installation. Particular points of note are: -
a) Effectiveness of earth conductors

This should be regularly checked. Danger signs are fragged cables at the plug and lead, faulty or incorrect joining of cables. Low voltage equipment's should be use whenever possible.
b) Water and chemicals

Moisture impregnates insulation and is often the cause of breakdown. Portable tools should be handled with great care in atmospheres containing inflammable chemicals. Fire may result from sparks of the commutators of a pistol drill in a garage. Portable lamps should not be used in garage pits, even if an earthed shield is used as mechanical damage to the lamp may lead to the ignition of petrol vapor.
c) Temporary installation

These tend to be fruitful sources of electrical accidents. Common causes are as follows:
i) Use of cables without mechanical protection e.g., V.R.I
ii) Lack of protective covering on switch boxes,
iii) Cables run over sharp edges
iv) Use of unearthed brass of unsaturated lamp holders
v) Unauthorized additions to circuits resulting in overloading with a consequent fire risk
vi) Circuits over-fused.

\section*{Other sources of danger}
a) Unprotected electrical heating elements.
b) Overloaded and over-fused cables particularly Flexible cables.
c) Unguarded crane trolley wire or bare overhead conductors, particularly where nonelectrical workers are in the vicinity.
d) Unprotected or unearthed socket outlets.
e) Poor or broken earth connections leading to live metalwork under fault conditions.

\section*{Points of danger for the electricians}

These are as follows: -
Burns: - electrical burns are generally more dangerous and more painful than normal burns, as they are usually caused by an arc containing molten metal.
Falls: - a greater percentage of industrial workshop accidents are caused by falls, either from a height or by workers tripping over equipment's and tools left lying everywhere.
Ladders: - points worthy noting,
i. Ladders should always be placed at a reasonable angle to the vertical.
ii. They should be anchored on a non-risky surface or effectively wedged.
iii. Aluminum Ladders should be used with great caution, particularly near bare conductors
iv. Don't attempt to lift heavy or unwieldy equipment's e.g., conduit lengths up or down a ladder unaided
v. Don't attempt acrobatic features. You may endanger your life and the lives of other and undermine your right to compensation.
Strains: - they occur through attempts to lift over-heavy weight on by lifting weights incorrectly. To lift heavy objects from ground level: - place your feet apart, get a good grip with the fingers, keep the back straight and lift by straightening the knees
Electric shock: - this is the main hazard in an electrical workshop. It is not always to work on dead conductors, but certainly precautions may be considered: -
a) Never assume that an installation is dead, instead check thoroughly before operating equipment's, and do not check by touching conductors with bare fingers.
b) Check circuit thoroughly before replacing a reloaded fuse in a live conductor D.F.B. and If still in doubt, replace with gloves, always keep your face clear.
c) If working on an installation to which other people have access e.g., a crane, remove fuses and place them in your pockets.

\section*{Types of electric shocks}
i) Hand to hand electric shocks; - it cuts across the chest where the body parts are situated and it happens where conductors are held by both hands. This type of shock may result death.
ii) Hand to foot; - this occurs when the conductors is between the hand and the foot. It usually not that serious though it may result to paralysis.
Factors that determine the severity of an electric shock
- Amount of current flowing through the body.
- The time of contact with the victim.

\section*{Moving machines}
$>$ Great care should be taken when working with moving machines e.g., motors.
> Oil rags and ties should be kept well clear (away). Do not remove guard and if it becomes necessary do so when the machine is stationary. Replace all guards before leaving the machine
$>$ Goggles should always be worn when operating a grinder and particularly drilling and grinding soft metal. E.g., brass and copper.

\section*{First aid}

First aid is only meant to be a temporary measure of saving a life as you seek medical attention from a skilled and trained personnel.

\section*{First aid kit}

Every industry workshop is legally bound to possess a first aid kit. Industrial first aid kit should contain the following: -
i) Sterilized dressings materials,
ii) Cotton wool,
iii) Adhesive plaster,
iv) Roller bandage ( 25 mm and 50 mm ),
v) Sal volatile,
vi) Eye drops,
vii) Gloves,
viii) Firm bandage,
ix) Scissors

\section*{Treatment for cuts}
> Elevate the injured part.
$>$ Wash the affected area/areas with clean water.
$>$ Do not wash wounds directly using water and soaps, although the skin around it may be cleansed using water and soaps.
> Apply a sterilized dressing, or an adhesive wound dressing as quickly as possible.

\section*{Treatment for burns}
$>$ If serious, send for a doctor or an ambulance. Cover the wound with a sterilized dressing.
$>$ Do not apply adhesive dressing or ointments

\section*{Chemical burns}
$>$ Flush with cold water immediately and apply a sterilized dressing.
> Use antidote if available (a solution of Bicarbonate or sodas for Acids, diluted vinegar for alkaline or buffered phosphates solutions for both types of burns).
$>$ Alkaline burns are more severe than Acids burns and should be medically attended to as quickly as possible.

\section*{Treatment for electric shock}
$>$ An electric shock is caused by the passage of current through the body (generally hand to hand or hand to feet) causing a paralysis of the muscles, particularly heart muscle.
$>$ Currents as low as 0.020 A have been known to be fatal. The severity of the shock will depend on: -
i. Voltage between the live metal and the earthed body.
ii. Moisture contents of skin or wetness of the body under shock
iii. Proximity of the body to effective earth
iv. Length of time of contact of the body to the live conductor.

N/B: - speed is essential in the treatment of electric shock. A few minutes delay may make all the difference between recovery and death.

\section*{Procedures of treating electric shock}
i. Switch off current before attempting to remove the casualty or if this not possible, remove him with an insulated material e.g., dry wood, belt or dry newspaper. Do not touch or attempt to grasp casualty's skin.
ii. Remove any obstructions to breathing e.g., tight collar, tie or false teeth
iii. Commence artificial respiration if the victim is unconscious
iv. At the same time call for a doctor or help, or take the victim to the doctor (hospital) without stopping artificial respiration.

\section*{The artificial respiration methods are: -}
a) Holger Nielsen method
b) Kiss of life method (mouth to mouth)
c) Silvester method

\section*{Holger Nielsen method}
$>$ Lay the victim on his/her stomach with elbows bent and projecting sideways.
$>$ The head is rested with one cheek on the hands.
$>$ The operator kneels In-front of the casualty.
> The operator now straightens out his arm and places his palms, finger outstretched, on the flat of the casualty's back.

\section*{Movements}
> Press down on casualty's back, counting slowly.
> Slide hands to casualty's elbows 3 times
$>$ Raise elbows counting 4 and 5.
$>$ Lower elbow and slide hands to patients back counting 6.
$>$ Repeat this cycle of action until the patient recovers or a doctor certifies death.

\section*{Kiss of life method}
$>$ Lay the victim on his or her back.
$>$ Place folded under the shoulder so that the head faces well back. This allows air to flow easily.
$>$ Pull the chin forward making sure that air passage is clear.
$>$ Seal off the nose with your hand and pinch the nostril.
$>$ Then breath steadily through the mouth into the victim chest until the chest rise.
$>$ Then move away to allow exhalation.
$>$ Resume deep inhalation for 6 to 7 breath a minute.
$>$ Repeat at the rate of 10 times a minute until the victim Starts breathing naturally or the doctor certifies death.

\section*{Procedures}
1. Place the victim or patient in his or her back and sit on by the side of his head.
2. The head should be held with both hands. One hand should place upwards while the other push the chest up and forward. This position ensures the patients lungs get the maximum oxygen.
3. Seal your lips round the patients' mouth.
4. Blow the air steadily into the patients' mouth and observe if the chest raise.
5. Remove your mouth and turn the patient lean aside and take a deep breath.
6. Repeat this cycle 6 times as quickly as possible continuously at about to an interval of one second.
7. Take the patient to the hospital for further treatment.

\section*{Silvester method}
> The patient is lied flat on his back with the shoulder raised on a cushion and his head falling back.
$>$ The rescuers kneeling In-front of the victim grip his hand wrists and places them outstretched crossing them at the lower part of the chest.
$>$ The victim chest then holding the wrist swings them outwardly as for as possible
$>$ Repeat this cycle until the patient recovers or doctor certifies death.

\section*{Fire safety}

In order to prevent the risk of fire, it is advisable to make sure that;
a) All appliances are switched off after use.
b) All highly combustible/flammable are kept away from any source of heat.
c) Smoking should be prohibited in some areas i.e. near batteries

\section*{TOPIC 2}

\section*{ELECTRICAL TOOLS}

A tool is an instrument used by a person to perform a task. They enable one to perform many tasks which would be extremely difficult without them. A practicing electrician and an electrical craftsman are concerned and the most compelled person to use electrical tools and build up his or she during the years of training.

\section*{Electrical tools are classified into the following categories: -}
> Cutting tools
$>$ Stripping tools
$>$ Fastening tools
$>$ Fixing tools
> Measuring tools
$>$ Holding tools
$>$ Other general-purpose tools

\section*{Cutting tools}

There include the following tools: -
- Hacksaw: - originally and principally made for cutting metals, but can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with the hacksaw.
- Stock and die: - stock and die are tools used to create screwing threads on steel conduits for easier joining of steel conduits and the steel boxes. This process of is known as threading.
- Side cutter pliers: - useful for cutting copper, brass, iron, aluminium and steel conductors and wires.
- Long nose pliers: - used for both cutting and bending, re-position and snip wires. Their name sake long nose gives excellent control while the cutting edge near the plier's joint provides one- tool convenience. Because of their long shape they are useful for reaching into small areas where cables or other materials have become stuck or unreachable with fingers or other means.

\section*{Stripping tools}

They include the following tools: -
i. Utility knife: - used for removing cable insulation
ii. Wire stripper: - a wire-stripper is a small, hand-held device used to strip the electrical insulation from electric wires.

\section*{Measuring tools}

They include the following tools: -
i. Engineer's ruler: - a scaled ruler for measuring distances and transferring measurement at a fixed ratio of length.
ii. Vanier Calipers: - an instrument for measuring external or internal dimensions, having two hinged legs resembling a pair of compasses and in- turned or out-turned points.
iii. Micrometer screw gauge: - a gauge which measures small distances or thickness between its two faces, one of which can be moved away from or towards the other by turning a screw with a fine thread.
iv. Try square: - an implement used to check and mark right angles in constructional work
v. Spirit level: - a device of a sealed glass tube partially filled with alcohol or other liquids, containing an air bubble whose position reveals whether a surface is perfectly level.
vi. Scriber: - a pointed instrument used for making marks on wood, bricks etc. To guide a saw or in signwriting.
vii. Center punch: - a tool consisting of a metal rod with a conical point for making an indentation, to allow a drill to make a hole at the same spot without slipping over.
viii. Plumb line: - a line with a plumb attached to it, used for finding the depth of water or determining the vertical on an upright surface. A Bob of lead or other heavy material forming the weight of a plumb line.
ix. Measuring tape: - a length of tape or thin flexible metal, marked at graded intervals for measuring.

\section*{Fixing and fastening tools}

They include the following tools
i. Screw driver: - a screw driver is a tool, manual or powered, for screwing and unscrewing (driving and removing) screws from surfaces. A screw driver is classified by its tip, which is shaped to fit the driving surface- - slot, grooves, recesses, etc. On the corresponding screw head. Proper use requires that the screwdriver's tip engage the head of a screw of the same size and type designation as the screwdriver tip. Screwdriver tips are available in a wide variety of types and sizes.
ii. Spanner: - a tool with a shaped opening or jaws for gripping and turning a nut or bolt.
iii. Adjustable pipe: - the pipe wrench (us), stills in wrench still sons (UK) is an adjustable wrench/ spanner used for turning soft iron and fittings with a rounded surface.

\section*{Drilling tools}

There include the following tools
a) A gimlet is a hand tool for drilling small holes, mainly in wood, without splitting.
b) Masonry drills: - is a typically used with a hammer $\square$ drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Power drill with variable speed and hammer action.
c) Raw plug tools and bits: - used for making holes in bricks wall or concrete to insert raw plug.

\section*{Other general-purpose tools}
i) Bending springs: - used for bending PVC conduits.
ii) Reamer: - used for removing burrs from inside edge of the conduits.
iii) Crimping tool: - used for preparation of conductors for termination.
iv) Bench vice: - to clamp or hold piece of conduit or metals when cutting or holding tightly a piece of metal while working on it.
v) Pot and ladle: - used to solder bit joint by heating the solder in the pot and then pouring it over joint by ladle.
vi) Chisel: - used to cut or shape metal in the workshop.
a) Also used for cutting away concrete, brick and other building materials to make way for pve and steel conduits.
b) For effective with a chisel requires a knowledge of the material to be cut. I.e. the angle or rake and clearal must be considered.
c) The following is a guiding table on angles selection: -

Table 2. 1 chisel cutting angles
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline MATERIALS & CUTTING ANGLES IN DEGREES \\

\hline Brass & 50 \\
\hline Copper & 45 \\
\hline Aluminium & 30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
d) A flat chisel is a general-purpose tool.
e) Cross-cut chisel is used for grooving materials, cutting keyway slot and for cutting places where the flat chisel is not convenient
vii) File: - is a cutting tool. The most usual form of file that has cross-cut teeth i.e. the groove of the face of file run into direction dividing small diameter of teeth. The single cut file has only one series of group.
Types of files
i. Flat file: - is parallel for about $2 / 3^{6}$ of its length and..., ........ It is used for cutting on both faces and both edges.
ii. The hand file: - has a parallel width throughout its length. Bot faces are double cut, one edge is only......... The safe (the uncut edge) prevents cutting into or a square corner while the face has been filed. Both the hand and flat file are used for general purpose. Hand file used when filing up to increase sharpness of other tools, it must be kept straight and square.
iii. Square file: - it is parallel for two thirds $2 / 3 \ldots$.... It has double cutting on all sides and is used for filling corners and slots where a hand file cannot enter.
iv. Round file tapers: - as does square file: it is used for filing out holes producing rounded corners, round-ended.
v. The three-square file: - is used for corners less than one position where awkward corners have to be taken and are graded as rough, bastard, second cut, smooth.
viii) The scrapper: - the flat scrapper resembles the file but is used...... Metal is removed from a surface by scrapping rather than cutting.
ix) The conduits vice: - is used for holding work piece while it is being operated on. There are two types of vices in electrical workshop which are: -
a) Bench vice: - used for bench work.
b) Pipe vice: - used for holding pipework and is probably looks more familiar vice to the electrician outride workshop.
x) The hammer: - there are many shapes of hammer heads, each designed for a specific type of work. The striking face is called pen.
Types of hammer
- They include the following
i. Ball pen hammer: - used for rivoting over the ends of pins and riven
ii. Engineer's hammer: - are made in weights varying from 100 g to $1 / 2 \mathrm{~kg}$. When choosing a hammer, you choose according to the weight.
iii. Light hammer: - are used for lighter and more delicate operations such as center punches, riveting, driving in small pins.
iv. Heavy hammer: - are necessary to do heavy chipping, driving and collars into shafts and driving in large pins into holes.
v. Hammer shafts: - should be made from well- seasoned straight grained hickery and be free from knots and off defects.
vi. Sledge hammer
vii. Claw hammer
viii. Cross and straight pen
ix. Club hammer
xi) The center punch: - is used when a circular dot marks are required. Are also used for marking the Centre point of a drilled holes to give the drill a good start and for marking the center of circles to provide a suitable point for placing on the leg of a divider to scribe the circle.

\section*{Use and care for TOOLS}
i) All tools should receive regular care and attention at frequent intervals through their working life.
ii) This is necessary if the tools are expected to perform their duties effectively and efficiently.
iii) A tool need sharpening at the edge where it becomes full.
iv) Hammer heads become loose and require tightening.
v) Screwdriver blades become distorted and tapered and need grounded carefully to restore and efficient working edges.
vi) Twist drill require grinding correctly for quick, clean and accurate work.
vii) Tools used as gauges should be kept a side when not in used so that their surfaces are not damaged in any way.
viii) When soft metals are filed the file, tooth tend to become filled with lamped with metal. If the teeth are not cleared the filing operation will prove difficult. If the metal is not firmly wedged it may be removed using a file card.
ix) Tightly wedged lumps of metal must be laboriously picked with the point of a scriber.
x) File teeth are very brittle. Thus, files should never be mixed with other tools but kept separately.
xi) When the thread on an electrical conduit is cut, the end should be filed to remove the left behind sharp surfaces as it could damage cable insulation when drawing them inside the conduits.
xii) The quality of an electrician in most cases can be simple in appearance and tool kit. Its clothing should be neat and with no loose ends hanging around. There should be sufficient,

\section*{Workshop practice}
i) First aid facilities and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers equipment's should be provided and placed at strategic places in the workshop.
ii) All power machines must be grounded and provided with emergency stopping options.
iii) Permit to work firms must be obtained when there is the possibility of live circuits or apparatus to be worked on.
iv) There must be free access to work areas at all times.
v) All accidents must be reported and recorded.
vi) For marking out and measurement of materials use: rulers, scribers, Centre punches, calipers, squares, gauges and micrometers.
vii) Cutting of materials requires shears, hacksaw, files, drills and grinding wheel.
viii) Internal screw threads are cut with wrenches and taps. External screw threads are cut with stocks and dies.
ix) Soldering process use blow lamps or gas torches for components with a suitable soldering flux and solder for the joints.

\section*{Site practice}
i) Electrician general tools are required for cable installation, operation and accessories fixing.
ii) Access to work areas requires steps, Ladders and thistles.
iii) First fix is the installation of cables and enclosures, carried out when building is yet to finishing stage.
iv) Second fix is the fixing of accessories and luminaries when the surface is completed.
v) The application form for the power supply feed gives all information of the installation and must be submitted to the power supply authority.

\section*{HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER STATION}

A hydro-electric power station refers to a generating station which utilizes the potential energy of water at a high level for the generation of electrical energy.
- Hydro-electric power stations are generally located in hilly areas where dams can be built conveniently and large water reservoirs can be obtained.
- In a hydro-electric power station, water head is created by constructing a dam across a river or lake. From the dam, water is led to a water turbine.
- The water turbine captures the energy in the falling water and changes the hydraulic energy (i.e., product of head and flow of water) into mechanical energy at the turbine shaft.
- The turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The depletion and the reservation of coal \& oil has promoted hydro-electric power stations in the world today.
- They have the added importance for flood control, storage of water for irrigation and water for drinking purposes.

\section*{Schematic Arrangement of Hydro-electric Power Station}

Although a hydro-electric power station simply involves the conversion of hydraulic energy into electrical energy, yet it embraces many arrangements for proper working and efficiency as shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-23.jpg?height=555&width=1063&top_left_y=465&top_left_x=505)

Figure 3.1 schematic arrangement of Hydro-electric power station
A dam is constructed across the river or lake and a water catchment area collects at the back of the dam to form a reservoir. A pressure tunnel is taken off from the reservoir to direct water to the valve house at the start of the penstock. The valve house contains the main sluice valves \& automatic isolating valves. The former controls the water flow to the power house and the latter cuts off supply of water when the penstock bursts. From the valve house, water is taken to water turbine through a huge steel pipe known as penstock. The water turbine converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. The turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
A surge tank (open from top) is built just before the valve house and protects the penstock from bursting in case the turbine gates suddenly close due to electrical load being thrown off. When the gates close, there is a sudden stopping of water at the lower end of the penstock and consequently the penstock can burst like a paper log. The surge tank absorbs this pressure swing by increase in its level of water.

\section*{Components of hydro-electric plants}

There are classified into two main categories: -
i) Hydraulic structures
ii) Water turbines
iii) Electrical equipment

Hydraulic structures in a hydro-electric power station include dam, spillways, headworks, surge tank, penstock and accessory works.
i) Dam; - this is a barrier which stores water and creates water head. Dams are built of concrete or stone masonry, earth or rock fill.
ii) Spillways: - during heavy rainfalls, a times the river flow exceeds the storage capacity of the reservoir. In order to discharge the surplus water from the reservoir, a spillway is used to get the surplus water down the stream.
iii) Headworks: - they are diversion structures at the head of water intake point. They are used for smooth controlling of water flow to the turbines.
iv) Surge tank: -
v) Penstock: - Penstocks are open or closed conduits which carry water to the
turbines. They are generally made of reinforced concrete or steel. water turbines used to convert the energy of falling into mechanical energy. They classified into; - impulse and reaction.
Impulse water turbines - used for high heads. In an impulse turbine, the entire pressure of water is converted into kinetic energy in a nozzle and the velocity of the jet drives the wheel.
Reaction water turbines; - used for low and medium heads. They include; -
- Francis turbines - used for low to medium heads. It consists of an outer ring of stationary guide blades fixed to the turbine casing and an inner ring of rotating blades forming the runner. The guide blades control the flow of water to the turbine.
- Kaplan turbines - is used for low heads and large quantities of water. It is similar to Francis turbine except that the runner of Kaplan turbine receives water axially.
Electrical equipment. They include the following; - alternators, transformers, circuit breakers and other switching and protective devices.
Advantages
i) It requires no fuel as water is used for the generation of electrical energy.
ii) It is quite neat and clean as no smoke or ash is produced.
iii) It requires very small running charges because water is the source of energy which is available free of cost.
iv) It is comparatively simple in construction and requires less maintenance.
v) It does not require a long starting time like a steam power station. In fact, such plants can be put into service instantly.
vi) It is robust and has a longer life.
vii) Such plants serve many purposes. In addition to the generation of electrical energy, they also help in irrigation and controlling floods.
viii) Although such plants require the attention of highly skilled persons at the time of construction, yet for operation, a few experienced persons may do the job well.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) It involves high capital cost due to construction of dam.
ii) There is uncertainty about the availability of huge amount of water due to dependence on weather conditions.
iii) Skilled and experienced hands are required to build the plant.
iv) It requires high cost of transmission lines as the plant is located in hilly areas which are quite away from the consumers.

\section*{Factors to consider when setting up hydro-electric power stations}
i) Availability of water: - Since the primary requirement of a hydro-electric power station is the availability of huge quantity of water, such plants should be built at a place (e.g., river, canal).
ii) Storage of water: - The storage helps in equalizing the flow of water so that any excess quantity of water at a certain period of the year can be made available during times of very low flow in the river.
iii) Cost and type of land: - The land for the construction of the plant should be available at a reasonable price \& the ground should be adequately withstand the weight of heavy equipment to be installed.
iv) Transportation facilities: - The site selected for a hydro-electric plant should be accessible by rail and road so that necessary equipment and machinery could be easily transported.

A diesel power station refers to a generating station in which diesel engine is used as the prime mover for the generation of electrical energy.

A diesel engine is used as the prime mover. The diesel burns inside the engine and the products of this combustion act as the "working fluid" to produce mechanical energy. The diesel engine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Due to the high cost of diesel, this power plants are used to produce small power.

\section*{Schematic arrangement of diesel power station}
- Below is a diesel power station set up

Figure 3.2 schematic arrangement of Diesel power station

\section*{Components of a diesel power station}
i) Fuel supply system: - It consists of storage tank, strainers, fuel transfer pump and allday fuel tank. The fuel oil is supplied at the plant site by rail or road. This oil is stored in the storage tank. From the storage tank, oil is pumped to smaller all-day tank at daily or short intervals. From this tank, fuel oil is passed through strainers to remove suspended impurities. The clean oil is injected into the engine by fuel injection pump.
ii) Air intake system: - This system supplies necessary air to the engine for fuel combustion. It consists of pipes for the supply of fresh air to the engine manifold. Filters are provided to remove dust particles from air which may act as abrasive in the engine cylinder.
iii) Exhaust system: -This system leads the engine exhaust gas outside the building and discharges it into atmosphere. A silencer is usually incorporated in the system to reduce the noise level.
iv) Cooling system. The heat released by the burning of fuel in the engine cylinder is partially converted into work. The remainder part of the heat passes through the cylinder walls, piston, rings etc. and may cause damage to the system. In order to keep the temperature of the engine parts within the safe operating limits, cooling is provided. The cooling system consists of a water source, pump and cooling towers. The pump circulates water through cylinder and head jacket. The water takes away
heat form the engine and itself becomes hot. The hot water is cooled by cooling towers and is recirculated for cooling

\section*{Advantages}
i) The design and layout of the plant are quite simple.
ii) It occupies less space as the number and size of the auxiliaries is small.
iii) It can be located at any place.
iv) It can be started quickly and can pick up load in a short time.
v) There are no standby losses.
vi) It requires less quantity of water for cooling.
vii) The overall cost is much less than that of steam power station of the same capacity.
viii) The thermal efficiency of the plant is higher than that of a steam power station.
ix) It requires fewer operating staff.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) The plant has high running charges as the fuel (i.e., diesel) used is costly.
ii) The plant does not work satisfactorily under overload conditions for a longer period.
iii) The plant can only generate small power.
iv) The cost of lubrication is generally high.
v) The maintenance charges are generally high.
i) Oct-Nov 2018 KNEC QUESTION: - Draw a labelled block diagram of a diesel power station.
ii) Outline three factors to be considered when selecting the site for a diesel power station

\section*{NUCLEAR POWER STATION}

A nuclear power station is a generating station in which nuclear energy is converted into electrical energy.
In kind of a power station, heavy elements such as Uranium $\left(U^{235}\right)$ or Thorium $\left(T^{232}\right)$ are subjected to nuclear fission* in a special apparatus known as a reactor. The heat energy thus released is utilized in raising steam at high temperature and pressure. The steam runs the steam turbine which converts steam energy into mechanical energy. The turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
---The most important feature of a nuclear power station is that huge amount of electrical energy can be produced from a relatively small amount of nuclear fuel as compared to other conventional types of power stations.

\section*{Schematic arrangement of a nuclear power station}

The schematic arrangement is as shown below; -
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-27.jpg?height=778&width=1557&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=255)

Figure 3.3 schematic arrangement of Nuclear power plant
i) Nuclear reactor: - It is an apparatus in which nuclear fuel $\left(\mathrm{U}^{235}\right)$ is subjected to nuclear fission. It controls the chain reaction* that starts once the fission is done. If the chain reaction is not controlled, the result will be an explosion due to the fast increase in the energy released.
ii) Heat exchanger: - The coolant gives up heat to the heat exchanger which is utilized in raising the steam. After giving up heat, the coolant is again fed to the reactor.
iii) Steam turbine: - The steam produced in the heat exchanger is led to the steam turbine through a valve. After doing a useful work in the turbine, the steam is exhausted to condenser. The condenser condenses the steam which is fed to the heat exchanger through feed water pump.
iv) Alternator: - The steam turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The output from the alternator is delivered to the busbars through transformer, circuit breakers and isolators

\section*{Factors to consider when setting up a nuclear power station}
i) Availability of water: - As sufficient water is required for cooling purposes, therefore, the plant site should be located where ample quantity of water is available, e.g., across a river or by sea-side.
ii) Disposal of waste: - The waste produced by fission in a nuclear power station is generally radioactive which must be disposed-off properly to avoid health hazards. The waste should either be buried in a deep trench or disposed-off in sea quite away from the sea shore. Therefore, the site selected for such a plant should have adequate arrangement for the disposal of radioactive waste.
iii) Distance from populated areas: - The site selected for a nuclear power station should be quite away from the populated areas as there is a danger of presence of radioactivity in the atmosphere near the plant.
iv) Transportation facilities: - The site selected for a nuclear power station should have adequate facilities in order to transport the heavy equipment during erection and to facilitate the movement of the workers employed in the plant

\section*{Advantages}
i) The amount of fuel required is quite small. Therefore, there is a considerable saving in
the cost of fuel transportation.
ii) A nuclear power plant requires less space as compared to any other type of the same size.
iii) It has low running charges as a small amount of fuel is used for producing bulk electrical energy.
iv) This type of plant is very economical for producing bulk electric power.
v) It can be located near the load centre's because it does not require large quantities of water and need not be near coal mines. Therefore, the cost of primary distribution is reduced.
vi) There are large deposits of nuclear fuels available all over the world. Therefore, such plants can ensure continued supply of electrical energy for thousands of years.
vii) It ensures reliability of operation.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) The fuel used is expensive and is difficult to recover.
ii) The capital cost on a nuclear plant is very high as compared to other types of plants.
iii) The erection and commissioning of the plant requires greater technical know-how.
iv) The fission by-products are generally radioactive and may cause a dangerous amount of radioactive pollution.
v) Maintenance charges are high due to lack of standardization.
vi) They are not suitable for varying loads as the reactor does not respond to load fluctuations efficiently.

\section*{Gas turbine power station}

A gas turbine power station is a generating station which employs gas turbine as the prime mover for the generation of electrical energy. Air is used as the working fluid.
The air is compressed by the compressor and is led to the combustion chamber where heat is added to air, thus raising its temperature. Heat is added to the compressed air either by burning fuel in the chamber or by the use of air heaters. The hot and high-pressure air from the combustion chamber is then passed to the gas turbine where it expands and does the mechanical work. The gas turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

\section*{Schematic arrangement of gas turbine power plant}

Below is the schematic arrangement of a gas turbine power plant: -
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-29.jpg?height=729&width=1317&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=375)

Figure 3.4 schematic arrangement of a Gas turbine power plant

\section*{Components of a gas power station}
i) Compressor: - used in the plant is generally of rotatory type. The air at atmospheric pressure is drawn by the compressor via the filter which removes the dust from air. The rotatory blades of the compressor push the air between stationary blades to raise its pressure. Thus, air at high pressure is available at the output of the compressor.
ii) A regenerator: - is a device which recovers heat from the exhaust gases of the turbine. The exhaust is passed through the regenerator before wasting to atmosphere. A regenerator consists of a nest of tubes contained in a shell.
iii) Combustion chamber: - The air at high pressure from the compressor is led to the combustion chamber via the regenerator. In the combustion chamber, heat* is added to the air by burning oil.
iv) Gas turbine: - The products of combustion consisting of a mixture of gases at high temperature and pressure are passed to the gas turbine. These gases in passing over the turbine blades expand and thus do the mechanical work.

\section*{Advantages}
i) It is simple in design as compared to steam power station since no boilers and their auxiliaries are required.
ii) It is much smaller in size as compared to steam power station of the same capacity.
iii) The initial and operating costs are much lower than that of equivalent steam power station.
iv) It requires comparatively less water as no condenser is used.
v) The maintenance charges are quite small.
vi) Gas turbines are much simpler in construction and operation than steam turbines.
vii) It can be started quickly form cold conditions.
viii) There are no standby losses.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) There is a problem for starting the unit. It is because before starting the turbine, the compressor has to be operated for which power is required from some external source.
ii) Since a greater part of power developed by the turbine is used in driving the compressor, the net output is low.
iii) The overall efficiency of such plants is low (about 20\%) because the exhaust gases from the turbine contain sufficient heat.
iv) The temperature of combustion chamber is quite high $\left(3000^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ so that its life is comparatively reduced.

\section*{SOLAR ENERGY}

\section*{Advantages of solar energy}
- It is a renewable source of energy.
- It reduces the cost of electricity bills since it is less costly / expensive.
- It has low maintenance cost.
- It has a universe application since you can use by producing light and heat.
- It has developed the technology.

Disadvantages of solar energy
- The purchasing amount of solar system is high.
- Solar energy is a weather dependent hence it only works on a sunny season.
- Solar energy storage system is very expensive.
- It uses a lot of space for its implementation.
- It is a pollutant since it causes greenhouse effect.

\section*{GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANT}

Geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine in that heat from a fuel source (in geothermal case, the Earth's core) is used to heat water or another working fluid. The working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator, thereby producing electricity. The fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source.

\section*{Dry steam power stations}

Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design. This type of power station is not found very often, because it requires a resource that produces dry steam, but is the most efficient, with the simplest facilities. In these sites, there may be liquid water present in the reservoir, but no water is produced to the surface, only steam. Dry Steam Power directly uses geothermal steam of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or greater to turn turbines. As the turbine rotates it powers a generator which then produces electricity and adds to the power field. Then, the steam is emitted to a condenser. Here the steam turns back into a liquid which then cools the water. After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that conducts the condensate back into deep wells, where it can be reheated and produced again.

\section*{Flash steam power stations}

Flash steam stations pull deep, high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines. They require fluid temperatures of at least $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, usually more. This is the most common type of station in operation today. Flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than $360^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(182^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource.

\section*{Binary cycle power stations}

Binary cycle power stations are the most recent development, and can accept fluid temperatures as low as $57^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water. This causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize, which then drives the turbines. This is the most common type of
geothermal electricity station being constructed today. Both Organic Rankine and Kalina cycles are used. The thermal efficiency of this type of station is typically about $10-13 \%$.

\section*{Advantages}
a) Comparatively ecologically clean. Unlike coal-fired power plants, geothermal ones use a renewable heat source with a constant supply. The amount of greenhouse gas from geothermal power plants is only $5 \%$ in the contrary with coal-fired power plants.
b) More energy. Geothermal power stations have great capacity - they can gravely help in meeting the demand for energy that grows every year, both in developed and developing countries.
c) Stable prices. Simple power plants depend on fuel, so the cost of their electricity is varying, based on the market price of fuel. Since geothermal power plants do not use fuel, they do not need to consider its cost, and they can offer their customers stable electricity costs.
d) Low operating costs. Geothermal installations require minimal maintenance compared to conventional power plants. As a result, they are reliable and cheap in operation.
e) Renewable and sustainable source. Geothermal energy will never end, unlike nonrenewable energy sources. As long as the earth supports our lives, geothermal energy will exist and geothermal power will work.
f) Permanent power supply. Unlike other renewable energy sources, geothermal one can provide a constant supply of energy - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, regardless of external factors. For example, solar panels can produce electricity only during the day, and wind turbines produce energy only with sufficient wind.
g) Small area. They occupy less space than their coal, oil and gas equivalents. Although they will reach far below the earth's surface, their area will be negligible.
h) Low noise work. There is a little noise in the production of geothermal energy. The main source of noise is the fans that are in the cooling systems. To reduce its level, engineers can install in the generator shops materials with high damping properties. It helps to reduce noise pollution.
i) Energy security. Using local geothermal resources, the need to supply sources from other countries reduces, which, in turn, lowers dependence on external influences and helps to increase our energy security.

\section*{Disadvantages}
a) Ecological problem. High environmental consumption of fresh water can be a loss for the environment, which will ultimately lead to its deficit. Liquids extracted from the earth during drilling contain a large number of toxic chemicals (including arsenic and mercury), as well as greenhouse gases (such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and radon). If they are incorrectly disposed or treated, they can get into the atmosphere or leak into groundwater and damage the environment and human health.
b) Geographical limits. Geothermal activity is the highest along the tectonic fault lines in the earth's crust. Exactly in these places the geothermal energy has the greatest potential. The drawback is that only few countries can use geothermal resources. Therefore, while having a look at their geographical peculiarities, such countries are the main producers of geothermal energy: the USA, Iceland, Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico
c) Seismic instability. There are reasons to believe that geothermal structures have caused underground shakings in different parts of the world. Despite the fact that seismic activity is often insignificant, it can lead to building damage, injuries and death.
d) Expensive construction. Geothermal power plants requires significant investments.

Although they have low operating costs, the cost of their construction may be much higher than coal, oil and gas plants. Much of these expenses concerns the exploration and drilling of geothermal energy resources. What is more, geothermal power plants require specially developed heating and cooling systems, as well as other equipment that can withstand high temperatures.
e) Possible exhaustion. Studies show that without careful management, geothermal tanks can be exhausted. In such cases, the geothermal power plant will become unnecessary until the tank is restored. The only inexhaustible option is to get geothermal energy directly from the magma, but this technology is still in the process of development. This option is worth investing at least because the magma will exist billions of years.

\section*{WIND POWER PLANT}

This generating station employs wind turbine as the prime mover for the generation of electrical energy. Winds turns the propeller-like blades of the wind turbine around a rotor. These blades drive the wind turbine which converts wind energy into mechanical energy. The wind turbine (which is a set of gears) drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

\section*{Advantages}
- Wind energy is a green energy source. Harnessing wind energy does not pollute the environment nearly as much as fossil fuels, coal and nuclear power do.
- As mentioned in the introduction of this article, the potential of wind power is absolutely incredible. Several independent research teams have reached the same conclusions: The worldwide potential of wind power is more than 400 TW (terawatts)
- Wind energy is a renewable source of energy. Wind is naturally occurring and there is no way we can empty the energy resources. Wind energy actually originates from the nuclear fusion processes that take place on the sun.
- Space efficient. The wind turbines can't be placed too close to each other, but the land inbetween can be used for other things.
- Although wind power only accounts for about $\mathbf{2 . 5 \%}$ of total worldwide electricity production, the capacity is growing at an incredible rate of $25 \%$ per year (2010). This does not only contribute in the fight against global warming, but also helps lowering costs:
- Prices have decreased over $\mathbf{8 0 \%}$ since 1980. Thanks to technological advancements and increased demand, prices are expected keep decreasing in the foreseeable future.
- It is generally true that operational costs tend to be low once the turbines first have been manufactured and erected. However, not every wind turbine is created equal some are more susceptible to maintenance than others.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Aesthetic impact: Many people are concerned with the visual effects that wind turbines have on the beautiful scenery of nature. They believe that giant wind turbines distract viewers from the beautiful surroundings.
- The initial cost is high.
- Wildlife: Wind turbines may be dangerous to flying animals. Many birds and bats have
been killed by flying into the rotors. Experts are now conducting research to learn more about the effects that wind turbines have on marine habitats.
- Remoteness of location: Although this may be an advantage (placing wind turbines in desolate areas, far away from people), it may also be a disadvantage. The cost of travel and maintenance on the turbines increases and is time consuming. Offshore wind turbines require boats and can be dangerous to manage.
- Noise: Some wind turbines tend to generate a lot of noise which can be unpleasant
- Safety at Sea: In the darkness/at night it may be difficult for incoming boats to see wind turbines thus leading to collisions.
ELECTRICAL POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
What is electric supply system
It refers to the conveyance of electric power from a power station to the consumers' premises.

An electric supply system consists of three principal components which are: - the power station, the transmission lines and the distribution system. Electric power is produced at the power stations which are located at favorable places, generally quite away from the consumers. It is then transmitted over large distances to load centres with the help of conductors known as transmission lines. Finally, it is distributed to a large number of small and big consumers through a distribution network.

A large network of conductors between the power station and the consumers can be broadly divided into two parts which are: transmission system and distribution system.

Each part is further sub-divided into two: primary transmission and secondary transmission and primary distribution and secondary distribution. As shown in the single line diagram
i) Generating station: In Fig 3.5, G.S. represents the generating station where electric power is produced by 3-phase alternators operating in parallel. The usual generation voltage is 11 kV . For economy purpose, during transmission,
the generated 11 kV is stepped up to 132 kV or more at the generating station with the help of 3-phase transformers. The transmission at high voltages has several advantages such as saving of conductor material and high transmission efficiency.
ii) Primary transmission: The electric power at 132 kV is transmitted by 3phase, 3-wire overhead system to the outskirts of the city. This forms the primary transmission.
iii) Secondary transmission: The primary transmission line terminates at the receiving station (RS) which usually lies at the outskirts of the city. At the receiving station, the voltage is reduced to 33 kV by step-down transformers. From this station, electric power is transmitted at 33 kV by 3 phase, 3-wire overhead system to various sub-stations (SS) located at the
strategic points in the city. This forms the secondary transmission.
iv) Primary distribution: The secondary transmission line terminates at the substation (SS) where voltage is reduced from 33 kV to 11 kV , 3-phase, 3-wire.

The 11 kV lines run along the

Figure 3. 6 Typical a.c. power supply scheme
important road sides of the city. This forms the primary distribution. It may be noted that big consumers (having demand more than 50 kW ) are generally supplied power at 11 kV for further handling with their own substations.
v) Secondary distribution: The electric power from primary distribution line $(11 \mathrm{kV})$ is delivered to distribution sub-stations (DS). These sub-stations are located near the consumers' localities and step down the voltage to $400 \mathrm{~V}, 3$-phase, 4-wire for secondary distribution. The voltage between any
two phases is 400 V and between any phase and neutral is 230 V . The singlephase residential lighting load is connected between any one
phase and neutral, whereas 3-phase, 400 V motor load is connected across 3-phase lines directly.
$\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{b}$ the secondary distribution consists of; feeders, distributors \& service mains.

\section*{Comparison of D.C. and A.C. Transmission}

The electric power can be transmitted either by means of d.c. or a.c. Each system has its own merits and demerits. It is, therefore, desirable to discuss the technical advantages and disadvantages of the two systems for transmission of electric power.
1. D.C. transmission. For some years past, the transmission of electric power by d.c. has been receiving the active consideration of engineers due to its numerous advantages. Advantages; - The high voltage d.c. transmission has the following advantages over high voltage a.c. transmission:
i) It requires only two conductors as compared to three for a.c. transmission.
ii) There is no inductance, capacitance, phase displacement and surge problems in d.c. transmission.
iii) Due to the absence of inductance, the voltage drops in a d.c. transmission line is less than the a.c. line for the same load and sending end voltage. For this reason, a d.c. transmission line has better voltage regulation.
iv) There is no skin effect in a d.c. system. Therefore, entire cross-section of the line conductor is utilized.
v) For the same working voltage, the potential stress on the insulation is less in case of d.c. system than that in a.c. system. Therefore, a d.c. line requires less insulation.
vi) A d.c. line has less corona loss and reduced interference with communication circuits.
vii) The high voltage d.c. transmission is free from the dielectric losses, particularly in the case of cables.
viii) In d.c. transmission, there are no stability problems and synchronising difficulties.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) Electric power cannot be generated at high d.c. voltage due to commutation problems.
ii) The d.c. voltage cannot be stepped up for transmission of power at high voltages.
iii) The d.c. switches and circuit breakers have their own limitations.
2. A.C. transmission; - Now-a-days, electrical energy is almost exclusively generated, transmitted and distributed in the form of a.c.

\section*{Advantages}
i) The power can be generated at high voltages.
ii) The maintenance of a.c. sub-stations is easy and cheaper.
iii) The a.c. voltage can be stepped up or stepped down by transformers with ease and efficiency. This permits to transmit power at high voltages and distribute it at safe potentials.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) An a.c. line requires more copper than a d.c. line.
ii) The construction of a.c. transmission line is more complicated than a d.c. transmission line.
iii) Due to skin effect in the a.c. system, the effective resistance of the line is increased.
iv) An a.c. line has capacitance. Therefore, there is a continuous loss of power due to charging current even when the line is open

\section*{Advantages of High Transmission voltage (high voltage transmission)}

The transmission of electric power is carried at high voltages due to the following reasons: -
i) Reduces volume of conductor material. Consider the transmission of electric power by a three-phase line.
$$\begin{aligned}
P & \text { Let } \\
V & =\text { power transmitted in watts } \\
\cos \phi & =\text { line voltage in volts } \\
l & =\text { power factor of the load } \\
R & =\text { length of the line in metres } \\
\rho & =\text { resistance per conductor in ohms } \\
a & =\text { resistivity of conductor material } \\
\text { Load current, } I & =\frac{P}{\sqrt{3} V \cos \phi} \\
\text { Resistance/conductor, } R & =\rho / / a \\
\text { Total power loss, } W & =3 I^{2} R=3\left(\frac{P}{\sqrt{3} V \cos \phi}\right)^{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{a} \\
& =\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi a} \\
\therefore \quad \text { Area of X-section, } a & =\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{W V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned}$$

Total volume of conductor material required
$$\begin{aligned}
& \quad=3 a l=3\left(\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{W V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}\right) l \\
& =\frac{3 p^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}=\frac{3 p^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

It is clear from exp. (i) that for given values of $\mathrm{P}, 1, \rho$ and W , the volume of conductor material required is inversely proportional to the square of transmission voltage and power factor. In other words, the greater the transmission voltage, the lesser is the conductor material required.
ii) Increases transmission efficiency
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Input power } & =P+\text { Total losses } \\
& =P+\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi a}
\end{aligned}$$

Assuming $J$ to be the current density of the conductor, then,
$$\begin{aligned}
a & =I / J \\
\therefore \quad \text { Input power } & =P+\frac{P^{2} \rho l J}{V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi I}=P+\frac{P^{2} \rho l J}{V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{1}{I} \\
& =P+\frac{P^{2} \rho l J}{V^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{* \sqrt{3} V \cos \phi}{P} \\
& =P+\frac{\sqrt{3} P \cdot I \rho l}{V \cos \phi}=P\left[1+\frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot l \rho l}{V \cos \phi}\right] \\
\text { Transmission efficiency } & =\frac{\text { Output power }}{\text { Input power }}=\frac{P}{P\left[1+\frac{\sqrt{3} J \rho l}{V \cos \phi}\right]}=\frac{1}{\left[1+\frac{\sqrt{3} J \rho l}{V \cos \phi}\right]} \\
& =\left[1-\frac{\sqrt{3} J \rho l}{V \cos \phi}\right] \text { approx. }
\end{aligned}$$

As $J, \rho$ and $l$ are constants, therefore, transmission efficiency increases when the line voltage is increased.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
* & I=\frac{P}{\sqrt{3} V \cos \phi} \\
* * & \text { Binomial theorem. }
\end{array}$$
iii) Decreases percentage line drop
$$\begin{array}{rlr}
\text { Line drop } & =I R=I \times \frac{\rho l}{a} \\
& =I \times \rho l \times J / I=\rho l J & {[\because a=I / J]} \\
\text { \%age line drop } & =\frac{J \rho l}{V} \times 100 & \ldots(i i i)
\end{array}$$

As $J, \rho$ and $l$ are constants, therefore, percentage line drop decreases when the transmission voltage increases.

\section*{Limitations of high transmission voltage}

From the above discussion, it might appear advisable to use the highest possible voltage for transmission of power in a bid to save conductor material. However, it must be realized that high transmission voltage results in; -
- the increased cost of insulating the conductors,
- the increased cost of transformers, switchgear and other terminal apparatus.

Therefore, there is a limit to the higher transmission voltage which can be economically employed in a particular case. This limit is reached when the saving in cost of conductor material due to higher voltage is offset by the increased cost of insulation, transformer, switchgear etc. Hence, the choice of proper transmission voltage is essentially a question of economics.

\section*{Various systems of power transmission}

As discussed earlier it is clear that for transmission of electric power, 3-phase, 3-wire a.c. system is universally adopted. However, other systems can also be used under special conditions for transmission which are: -
1. D.C. system
- D.C. Two-wire
- D.C. Two-wire with mid-point earthed
- D.C. Three-wire
2. Single-phase A.C. system
- Single-phase two-wire.
- Single-phase two-wire with mid-point earthed.
- Single-phase three-wire.
3. Two-phase A.C. system
- Two-phase four-wire.
- Two-phase three wire.
4. Three-phase A.C. system
- Three-phase three-wire.
- Three-phase four-wire.
D.C. system

\section*{D.C. Two-wire with one conductor earthed}

In the 2-wire d.c. system, one is the outgoing or positive wire and the other is the return or negative wire as shown in Fig. 7.4. The load is connected between the two wires.
```
Max. voitage between conductors $=V_{n}$
    Power to be transmitted $=P$
$\therefore \quad$ Load current, $I_{1}=P V_{m}$
If $R_{1}$ is the resistance of each line conductor, then,
            $R_{1}=\rho \| a_{1}$
where $a_{1}$ is the area of X -section of the conductor.
    Line losses, $\quad W=2 l_{1}^{2} R_{1}=2\left(\frac{P}{V_{m}}\right)^{2} \rho \frac{l}{a_{1}}$
```
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-39.jpg?height=318&width=251&top_left_y=1836&top_left_x=1349)
```
$\therefore \quad$ Area of X -section, $a_{1}=\frac{2 P^{2} \rho l}{W V_{m}^{2}}$
Volume of conductor material required
        $=2 a_{1} l=2\left(\frac{2 P^{2} \rho I}{W V_{m}^{2}}\right) I=\frac{4 p^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{n}^{2}}$
```

It is a usual practice to make this system as the basis for comparison with other systems. Therefore, volume of conductor material required in this system shall be taken as the basie quantity ie.
$$\frac{4 P^{2} \rho I^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}}=K(\text { say })$$

\section*{Two-wire d.c. system with mid-point earthed}

The maximum voltage between any conductor and earth is $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}$ so that maximum voltage between conductors is $2 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{m}}$. as shown below; -
$$\text { Load current, } \quad I_{2}=P / 2 V_{w n}$$

Let $a_{2}$ be the area of X-section of the conductor.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \quad \text { Line losses, } W=2 I_{2}^{2} R_{2}=2\left(\frac{p}{2 V_{m}}\right)^{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{a_{2}} \\
& \therefore \quad \begin{aligned}
& \\
& \therefore \quad=\frac{P_{2}^{2} \rho l}{2 a_{2} V_{m}^{2}} \\
& \therefore \quad \text { Area of } \mathrm{X} \text {-section, } a_{2}=\frac{P^{3} \rho l}{\left.2 W V_{2}\right]} \\
& \therefore \quad \text { Volume of conductor material required } \\
&=2 a_{2} l=2\left(\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{2 W V_{m}^{2}}\right) l=\frac{P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{3. Three-wire d.c. system}

In a 3-wire d.c. system, there are two outers and a middle or neutral wire which is earthed at the generator end as shown in Fig. 7.6. If the load is balanced, the current in the neutral wire is zero. Assuming balanced loads.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-40.jpg?height=641&width=1275&top_left_y=1563&top_left_x=425)

\section*{4. Single phase 2-wire a.c. system with one conductor earthed}

Fig. alongside shows a single phase 2 -wire a.c. system with one conductor earthed. The maximum voltage between conductors is $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}$ so that r.m.s. value of voltage between them is $\frac{V_{m} V_{m}}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{2}}$. Assuming the load power factor to be $\cos \varphi$,
$$\text { Load current, } I_{4}=\frac{P}{\left(V_{m} / \sqrt{2}\right) \cos \phi}=\frac{\sqrt{2} P}{V_{m} \cos \phi}$$

Let $a_{a}$ be the area of X -section of the conductor.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad \text { Line lonsen, } W=2 l_{4}^{2} R_{4}=2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2} P}{V_{n} \cos \phi}\right)^{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{a_{4}}=\frac{4 P^{2} \rho l}{\cos ^{2} \phi V_{=}^{2} a_{4}} \\
& \therefore \quad \text { Area of } \mathrm{X} \text {-section } a_{4}=\frac{4 p^{2} \rho l}{\cos ^{2} \phi W \Gamma_{n}^{2}} \\
& \text { Volame of conductor matcrial requirad } \\
& -2 a_{2} t-2\left(\frac{4 P^{2} \rho!}{V_{n}^{2} W \cos ^{2} \varphi}\right) t \\
& =\frac{2}{\cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{4 P^{2} \rho r^{2}}{\pi V_{n}^{2}} \\
& =\frac{2 K}{\cos ^{2} \phi} \\
& {\left[\because K-\frac{4 P^{2} \rho f^{2}}{W V_{\sim}^{2}}\right]}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-41.jpg?height=299&width=473&top_left_y=601&top_left_x=1357)

Hence, the volume of conductor material required in this system is $2 \cos 2 \varphi$ times that of 2 -wire d.c. system with the one conductor earthed.

\section*{5. Single phase 2-wire system with mid-point earthed}

The fig. alongside shows a single phase a.c. system with mid-point earthed. The two wires possess equal and opposite voltages to earth (i.e., $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}$ ). Therefore, the maximum voltage between the two wires is $2 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{m}}$. the r.m.s value of voltage between conductors
is $=2 V_{m / \sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2 V_{m}}=2 V_{m / \sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2 V_{m}}$
$$\text { Load current, } I_{5}=\frac{P}{\sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}$$

Let $a_{5}$ be the area of X -section of the conductor.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Line losses, } W & =2 I_{5}{ }^{2} R_{5}=2\left(\frac{P}{\sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}\right)^{2} R_{5} \\
\therefore \quad W & =\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{a_{5} V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\therefore \quad \text { Area of X-section, } a_{5}=\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}$$

Fig. 7.8

Volume of conductor material required
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2 a_{5} l=2\left(\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}\right) l=\frac{2 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \\
& =\frac{2}{\cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}} \\
& =\frac{K}{2 \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned}$$
6. Single phase, 3-wire system: - The single phase 3-wire system is identical in principle with 3 -wire d.c. system. The system consists of two outers and neutral wire taken from the mid-point of the phase winding as shown in Fig. 7.9. If the load is balanced, the current through the neutral wire is zero. Assuming balanced load,

Max. voltage between conductors $=2 V_{m}$
R.M.S.value of voltage between conductors $=2 V_{m} / \sqrt{2}=\sqrt{2} V_{m}$ If the p.f of the load is $\cos \phi$, then,
$$\text { Load current, } I_{6}=\frac{P}{\sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}$$

Let $a_{6}$ be the area of X -section of each outer conductor.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Line losses, } \begin{aligned}
W & =2 I_{6}^{2} R_{6}=2\left(\frac{p}{\sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}\right)^{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{a_{6}} \\
& =\frac{p^{2} \rho l}{a_{6} V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \\
\therefore \quad \text { Area of X-section, } a_{6} & =\frac{p^{2} \rho l}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned}, l
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-42.jpg?height=687&width=489&top_left_y=426&top_left_x=1390)

Assuming the area of X -section of neutral wire to be half that of the outer wire, Volume of conductor material required
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2 \cdot 5 a_{6} l=2 \cdot 5\left(\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}\right) l=\frac{2 \cdot 5 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \\
& =\frac{2 \cdot 5}{\cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}} \\
& =\frac{5 K}{8 \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned} \quad\left[\because K=\frac{4 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}}\right]$$

Hence, the volume of conductor material required in this system is $5 / 8 \cos 2 \varphi$ times that required in a 2 -wire d.c. system with one conductor earthed.
7. Two phase, 4-wire a.c. system

The four wires are taken from the ends of the two-phase windings and the mid-points of the two windings are connected together. This system can be considered as two independent single-phase systems, each transmitting one half of the total power.

Max. voltage between outers $A$ and $B=2 V_{m}$
R.M.S. value of voltage $=2 V_{m} / \sqrt{2}=\sqrt{2} V_{m}$

Power supplied per phase ( $1 . e_{\text {, }}$, by outers $A$ and $B$ ) $=P / 2$
Assuming p.f. of the load to be $\cos \phi$,
$$\text { Load current, } I_{7}=\frac{P / 2}{\sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}=\frac{P}{2 \sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}$$

Let $a_{7}$ be the area of X-section of one conductor.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Linc losses, } W & =4 I_{7}^{2} R_{7}=4\left(\frac{P}{2 \sqrt{2} V_{m} \cos \phi}\right)^{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{a_{7}} \\
\therefore & W & =\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{2 a_{7} V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi} \\
\therefore & \text { Area of X-section, } a_{7} & =\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{2 W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}
\end{aligned}$$
$\therefore$ Volume of conductor material required
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-43.jpg?height=633&width=449&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=1250)
$=4 a_{7} l$
$=4\left(\frac{P^{2} \rho l}{2 W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}\right) l=\frac{4 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{2 W V_{m}^{2} \cos ^{2} \phi}$
$=\frac{1}{2 \cos ^{2} \phi} \times \frac{4 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}}$
$=\frac{K}{2 \cos ^{2} \phi}$
$$\left\lceil\because K=\frac{4 P^{2} \rho l^{2}}{W V_{m}^{2}}\right\rceil$$

\section*{8. Third phase, 3-wire system}

The third or neutral wire is taken from the junction of two-phase windings whose voltages are in quadrature with each other. Obviously, each phase transmits one half of the total power. The R.M.S. voltage between outgoing conductor and neutral.

\section*{9. 3-phase, 3-wire system}

This system is almost universally adopted for transmission of electric power. The 3-phase, 3wire system may be star connected or delta connected. The neutral point N is earthed.

\section*{10. 3-phase, 4-wire system}

In this case, 4th or neutral wire is taken from the neutral point as shown in Fig. below..., The area of X-section of the neutral wire is generally one-half that of the line conductor. If the loads are balanced, then current through the neutral wire is zero. Assuming balanced loads and p.f. of the load as $\cos \varphi$

\section*{TOPIC 8}

\section*{EARTHING AND PROTECTION}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the topic, the learner should be to; -
i. Explain the terms used in earthing
ii. Purposes for earthing
iii. Parts of an earthing system
iv. Different methods of earthing
v. Over current protection
vi. Test for an earthing system
vii. Relevant IEE regulations
- Earthing refers to the connection to the general mass of the earth.
- A conductor or other metal is said to be earthed when it's effectively connected to the general mass of the earth by means of metal rod or other conducting materials.
- Solid earthing is when the metal is connected to earth without the intervention of a fuse, switch, circuit breakers, resistances, reactor or a solenoid.

\section*{REASONS FOR EARTHING}
1. To prevent or minimize the risks of electric shocks to human beings and livestock by providing a common resistance discharge path after currents which would otherwise prove an injury or fatal to a person in contact with the metal-work associated with the faulty circuits.
2. To reduce the risks of fire hazards
3. To permit sufficient current to flow to earth in case of a fault, to operate the protective device.

\section*{GENERAL PROVISION FOR EARTHING}
- The I.E.E Regulation requires that every item, apparatus, appliances and conductor shall be prevented from giving rise to dangerous earth leakages current by all insulated construction, by double insulation, by insolation or by earthing of all exposed metal parts. This is required for insulation where the voltage exceeds low voltage.
- Provision of consumers earthing terminals adjacent to the consumers terminals and an earth continuity conductor throughout the insulation.
- Connection of all metalwork of wiring system other than current carrying parts..., e.g. cable sheaths and armour, conduits, ducts, trunking and catenary.........., to the earth continuity conductor. This doesn't apply to isolated metal parts such as: -
i. Short length of metal used for machines protection of cables having a nonmetallic sheath.
ii. Metal clips for fixing cables,
iii. Metal laps caps,
iv. Screws, nameplates and catenary wires where insulated hangers are used.
- Connection of all exposed metal-work to the earth continuity conductor.
- Connection of every earthing terminals of the socket outlets to the Earthing Continuity Conductor (E.C.C)
- Provision and connection to the Earthing Continuity Conductor (E.C.C)

PARTS OF AN EARTHING SYSTEM
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-46.jpg?height=816&width=1462&top_left_y=584&top_left_x=329)

Fig 8. 1 parts of an earthing system
i. Consumer Earthing Terminal: -it is a terminal fixed at the consumer's control unit (C.C.U) at the intake point. The terminal is directly attached to the casing of the consumer's intake point without any point of insulation. It connects both the earth Continuity Conductor (E.C.C.) from electrical appliances and accessories and the earthing lead, electrode to the general mass of the earth.
ii. Earthing lead: - It connects the consumer's earthing terminal to the earthing electrode that is fixed in the general mass of the earth. The earthing lead is made of copper and sizes to be used are given in a table provided by the IEE regulations subject to a maximum of $70 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. For this reason, the connection of earth leakage circuit breaker of a cross-sectional area of $25 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ need to be exceeded. The connection of an earthing lead to the earthing electrode must be accessible but mechanically protected from mechanical damage by use of either PVC/ Steel conduits where applicable. Joining should be professionally soldered, or clamped. Copper clad, aluminium conductors shall not be used.
iii. Earthing electrode: - refers to as a metal rod or rods, a system of underground metal pipes or other conducting objects. Used for providing an effectual connection with the general mass of the earth, and is buried in the ground.
iv. Earthing Continuity Conductor [E.C.C]: - these are very vital linking conductors which runs from the consumer's intake point to various electrical accessories and appliances such as socket outlets, fluorescent lamps fittings, cooker's intake points heating element's intake points. Always ensure the following: -
- Regularly check, inspect and test the viability of the earthing continuity conductor for various power outlets and intake points.
- Replace fault Earthing Continuity Conductor immediately you discover its faultiness.
- Always provide an Earthing Continuity Conductor [E.C.C] to all newly installed machines, accessories and appliances if the machine or appliances has an earth link terminal.
- Use the correct cable size as per the IEE regulations (depending on the amount of current required by the machine or appliances). This prevents the melting up of conductors before the excess current reaches the earth surface.
- Always ensure all the earthing terminals, plates and links are commonly interconnected at the consumer's intake point; from all the appliances and accessories.

\section*{[CRAFT] VARIOUS METHODS USED TO ACHIEVE EARTHING OF AN INSTALLATION}
1. Connection to the metal sheath and armoring of a supply authority's underground supply cable.
2. Connection to a continuous earth wire (CEW) provided by a supply authority where the distribution of electricity is by overhead lines.
3. Connection to an earth electrode.
4. Installation of a protective multiple earthing (PME) system.
5. Installation of automatic fault protection., i.e. Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers (ELCB).

\section*{FORMS OF EARTHING ELECTRODE}

The earthing electrodes can be any one of the following forms: -
a) Pipes: - a pipe of 200 mm diameter cast iron, 2 m long which is buried in a coke filled pit.
b) Plates: - a plate electrodes are normally of cast iron buried vertically with the centre about one metre below the surface. Copper plates may also be used.
- Plate electrodes provides a large surface area and are used mainly where the ground is shallow (where resistivity is low)
c) Strip: - a copper strip is mostly useful in shallow soil, overlying rocks. The strip should be buried to a depth of not less 50 cm or nearly 2 feet's.
d) Rods: - Rod electrode are very economical and require no excavation for their installation.
- Rods are driven into the ground so that the soil contact with the rod is close and definite.
- Rods are made hard drawn copper with hardened steel tip and a steel driving cap.

\section*{TYPES OF EARTH ELECTRODES}
a) Plates: -generally made of copper, zinc, steel or cast iron and may be the solid type or lattice type. Because of their mass, they have to be costly with steel or cast-iron type. Care must be taken to prevent corrosion of plates and are generally installed at the edge of houses in the ground (verandas of houses) to about a depth of 2.3 metres deep. The plates are installed relatively very near the surface of the ground which leads to resistance fluctuations due to seasonal changes throughout the year.
b) Rods: - they are less costly than other electrodes to install. They don't require much space, convenient to test and do not create large voltage gradient because the earth fault current is dissipated vertically.
- Deeply installed rods are not subject to seasonal resistance changes. The solid copper rods give excellent conductivity and is resistant to corrosion, but its not ideal for driving into deep soil as its soft and may bend when it comes into contact with an obstacle.
- The bimetallic rod has a steel core-card and copper on them. The steel core gives the necessary rigidity and copper extremely gives good conductivity and high resistance to corrosion.
c) Strips: - copper strips used where the soil is shallow and outlies rocks. It should be buried in a trench to a depth of not less than 50 cm and should be not used where there is a possibility of the ground being disturbed e.g. on farmland. The strip electrode is most effective if buried in clinches under hedge rooms where the biological action arising from the decay or vegetation maintains a conducive soil resistance.
d) The earth mats: - it consists of copper buried in trenches up to 1 m deep. The mat can be laid out either linearly or in start-form and terminated at the down leads from the transformer or other items or equipment to be earthed. The total length of conduction used can be expensive. The most common areas where this system is used are where rocks are present near the surface of the soil, making deep excavation impracticable. As with the plate electrodes, this method of earthing is subject to seasonal changes in resistance.
e) The cable sheaths: - these form a metallic return path and are provided by the supply undertaking. They are particularly useful where an extensive underground cable system is available, the combination of sheath and armoring forms a mass effective earth electrode. In most cases, the resistance to earth of such a system is less than $1 \Omega$, cable sheath is $\qquad$ more used to provide a direct metallic connection for the return of fault current to the neutral of a supply system rather as means of direct connection with earth; thus, even though such cables are served with gradual deterioration of the final jute or hessian serving.

\section*{METHODS OF EARTHING}

There are various methods of earthing such as: -
- Direct method of earthing
- Protective multiple earthing [PME] system.

\section*{DIRECT EARTHING METHOD}
- This means connecting to an earth electrode of some recognized types of reliance on the effectiveness of overcurrent protection devices.
- For protection against shock and fire hazards in the event of an earth fault.
- A potential difference will exist between earthed metal work and the general mass of the earth to which the electrode is connected in case of an earth fault.
- This potential difference will depend on the line voltage, the sub-station or supply transformer, earth resistance, the line resistance, the fault resistance and earth resistance at the point of installation.
- Direct earthing connection are made with electrodes in the earth at the consumer's premises or the use of sheaths in underground cables, but the latter method is more generally used to provide a direct-metallic connection for the return of earth fault current to the neutral of the supply system. The earth electrode can take a number of forms and can be either a single connection or a network of multiple electrodes

PROTECTIVE MULTIPLE EARTHING [PME]

Fig 8. 2 a typical protective multiple earthing system(PME)
- This form of earthing is also known as continuous neutral earthing [C.N.E.]. The system uses the neutral of the mains power supply as the earthing point in all the protected metal-work in an installation to this common point.
- The consumers earthing terminals, all on to earth, first are converted to neutral points, with an intention to ensure that sufficient current flows under fault conditions to operate the excess current protective devices. There are two main hazards associated with protective multiple earthing (P.M.E] system.
- First, due to the increased earth fault current is encouraged to flow; there is an enhanced fire risk during the time it takes for the protective device to operate. Also, it's essential to ensure that the neutral conductor cannot rise up to dangerous potential with respect to earth. This is because the interconnection of neutral and protective metal-work would automatically extend
the resultant shock risk to all the protected metalwork on every installation connected to this particular supply distribution network.
- Due to this hazard, the following requirements must be met: -
a) The neutral conductor must be earthed at a number of points in the systems and the maximum resistance from neutral to earth must not exceed $10 \Omega$. An earth electrode should also be installed at every consumers installation.
b) There must be no fusible cut-out, single pole switch, removable links or automatic circuit breakers in the neutral conductor in the consumers installation.
c) The neutral conductor at any point must be made of same materials and be at least of equal cross-sectional area as the phase conductor.
- P.M.E. can only be applied to a consumer's installation, if the supply authority's feeder is multiple earthed.

\section*{Advantages of protective multiple earthing system}
$\checkmark$ There is low impedance path for fault current to flow to the mass of the earth via the neutral conductor.
$\checkmark$ Impedance to earth is low even though individual earth impedances may be high due to multiple earthing connections.

\section*{Disadvantages of protective multiple earthing system}
$\checkmark$ One needs to seek authorization from the supply authority in order to use this earthing method.
$\checkmark$ Earth current may circulate both multiple earth electrodes.
$\checkmark$ Shock may arise if any earth metal work associated with the system is not bonded to the neutral conductor.

\section*{ELECTRICAL PROTECTION}
- Protection refers to the process of. $\qquad$

\section*{REASONS FOR ELECTRICAL PROTECTION}
(i) To avoid
(ii) To
(iii) To
(iv) To
- All electrical equipment's, appliances and circuits must be protected against damage arising from one or more of the following abnormal conditions such as; -
(i) Overloading or overcurrent,
(ii) Short circuit or insulation failure,
(iii) Earth fault,
(iv) Over voltage,
(v) Low voltage,
(vi) Reverse power flow in case of parallel feeders.
- Excess current protection is one of the requirements of statutory and I.E.E Regulations. The IEE Regulation states that; - every consumer's installation shall be adequately controlled by switchgears that are readily accessible to the consumers which shall incorporate means of excess current protection.
- The means of excess current protection required by the regulations shall comprise of a fuse placed in each live conductor of the supply or a circuit breaker having an excess current release fitted in each live conductor of the supply.
- The means of excess current referred above may be omitted if: -
i. The rating of all cables connected between the supply undertaking fuse or circuit breaker and the consumer's sub-circuit fuses or CBs is not loss than the rating of the supply undertaking's fuse or CBs,
ii. The excess current protective devices protecting all circuits controlled by the switchgear are located within the same enclosure as the switchgear or alternatively are located immediately adjacent to it.
- All circuit's requires protection against the effects of excess current which includes increased temperatures in conductors (leading to deterioration of insulation), hence increased fire hazards, excess voltage drop and deterioration of conductor joints and termination.

\section*{TERMS USED IN ELECTRICAL PROTECTION}
a) A fuse; - a device for opening a circuit by means of a fuse element designed to melt when an excessive current flow through it. It consists of a fuse base and a fuse link.
b) A circuit breaker; - a mechanical device for making and breaking a circuit both under normal and under-abnormal circumstances such as those of a short-circuit. The circuit is being broken automatically.
c) Current rating; - this is a current, less than the minimum fusing current stated by the manufacturers as current that the fuse can carry continuously without deterioration of the fusing element or the maximum current that a fuse will carry indefinitely without undue deterioration of the fuse-element.
d) Fusing/fuse element; -
e) Fusing current; - this is the minimum current that will cause the fuse to operate in a specified time under the prescribed conditions, or the minimum current that will blow the fuse.

g) Breaking capacity; - this is the greatest prospective current that may be associated with a fuse under prescribed conditions of voltage and power factor or time constant.
h) Discrimination; - the ability of fuses and circuit breakers to interrupt the supply of a faulty circuit without interfering with the source of supply of the healthy circuits. This requires that a larger fuse near the source supply will remain unaffected by fault currents which would cause a smaller fuse, for that form the same, to operate.
i) Close excess current protection; - excess current protection which will operate four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the circuit which it protects.
j) Coarse excess current protection; - excess current protection which will not operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the circuit which it protects.

\section*{PROTECTION BY USE OF FUSES}
- Fuse offers a means of excess current protection in its basic form; the fuse consists of a short length conductor of a suitable material. In most cases, it is in the form of a wire which has a very small cross-sectional area compared to the circuit conductor.
- A current flow which is greater than the current rating of the wire (fusing element); the fusing element(wire) will get very hot and eventually melt.

\section*{TYPES OF FUSES}

\section*{i. Cartilage fuses; -}
- It consists of a ceramic or porcelain tube containing the fusing element.
- The fuse is filled with a non-fusible sand which serves the purpose of quenching the resultant heat produced(generated) when the element melts, the fusing factor is between 1.25 to 1.75 depending on the type of the fusing/ fuse elements.

Fig 8. 3 a typical cartilage fuse

\section*{Advantages of cartilage fuses}
a) The fuse is designed in such a way that it is enclosed hence no destruction of the fuse element.
b) The fuse rating is accurately given.

\section*{Disadvantages of cartilage fuses}
a) The fusing element is more expensive to replace.
b) They are designed in such a way that they cannot be interchanged expect with their own group.
c) They are unsuitable for use for high rated voltage-current circuits.
ii. Rewireable fuses; -
- A rewireable fuse is a simple and relatively cheaper type of over-current protective device.
- It consists of a porcelain bridge and a fuse base.
- The fusing/fuse element is connected between the terminals of the bridge.
- An asbestos tube is fitted in the fuse to minimize the effects of arcing formed when the fuse element melts.
- The fusing factor of a rewireable fuse is roughly 2 with a protective asbestos pad which eventually reduces the factor to 1.9 . This implies that a fuse-element rated at 10A will melt when $10 \times 2=20 \mathrm{~A}$ flows in the circuit. It also implies that a $1.00 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ conductor (which has a current rating of 11 A ) may, in an overload condition, be made to carry as much as 50 percent overload without the fuse coming into action; the cable is thus run on overload which may lead eventually to a fault.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-55.jpg?height=315&width=860&top_left_y=1111&top_left_x=242)

Fig 8. 4 A typical rewireable fuse

\section*{Advantages of a rewireable fuses}
a) It is not expensive.
b) It is easy to replace the fusing element.
c) It is simple in construction.

\section*{Disadvantages of a rewireable fuses}
a. The ease with which an inexperienced person can replace a 'blown' fuse element with a wire of incorrect gauge or type.
b. It takes time before blowing or melting hence it can cause physical damage to circuit conductors and equipment's being protected.
c. It doesn't offer discrimination between a surge and a continuous fault current; - this means it is possible, in certain installation conditions, for a 15A fuse-element to melt before a 10A fuse-element. Also, a rewireable fuse is not capable of discriminating between a momentary high current e.g. motor starting current and a continuous fault current.
d. It's very difficult to know the rating, this renders this fuse unsuitable for circuits which requires discrimination protection.
e. The fuse element is always at a fairly high temperatures when in use, this leads to it's oxidization hence the fuse element deteriorates very fast.
f. They are classified by offering course and close excess current protection i.e., the device will take longer than 4 hours to come into operation when a current of 1.5 times the designed low current of the associated circuit flows through the fuse element.
iii. HIGH BREAKING CAPACITY FUSE (H.B.C)
- It has ceramic with some metal cups.
- The fuse element is silver of special shape stripes. The stripes are surrounded by chemically purified silver.
- When an overload occurs, breaking the fuse element, there is formation of an ore.
- These fuses are commonly used to protect current in large industry, mains cables, motor circuit for back-up protection for machinery.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-56.jpg?height=616&width=1077&top_left_y=787&top_left_x=554)

Advantages of high breaking capacity fuse (H.B.C)
a) There are discriminative in nature (will not blow when there is a surge).
b) Has a short time operation, hence can be used for short circuits.
c) Is able to

Disadvantages of high breaking capacity fuse (H.B.C)
a) It very expensive
b) Requires an experienced person to replace.
iv. Protection by circuit breakers
- It is a mechanical device for making and breaking of circuit both under normal and abnormal conditions.
- The circuit breaker is selected for a particular duty taking the following into consideration; -
$\checkmark$ The normal current it will have to carry,
$\checkmark$ The amount of current which the supply system will feed into the circuit fault.
Functions of a circuit breakers
- It permits the installation of appliances it will protect to be used up to its full rated capacity.
- To protect devices to be used in dangerous conditions.
- They are to provide a closer and more accurate degree of excess current protection.
- The circuit breaker has a mechanism which when it is in a closed position, holds the contact together. The contacts are separated when the release mechanism of a circuit breaker is operated by hand or automatically by magnetic or thermal means.

\section*{Magnetic tripping}
- It employs a solenoid which is a coil with an iron slug. The normal circuit current which flows through the coil is not sufficiently strong to produce a significant magnetic flux.
- As the circuit current increases the magnetic field strength increases to cause the iron slug to move within the solenoid and collapses the attached tripping linkage to open the contact.

\section*{Thermal tripping}
- It uses a heat sensitive bimetallic element. When the element is heated to a predetermined temperature, the resultant deflection is arranged to trip the circuit breakers.
- The time taken to heat the element to this temperature provides the necessary time-delay characteristics.
- The bimetal element may be arranged to carry the circuit current, and so be directly heated. When a heavier overload occurs, the magnetic trip coil operates quickly to disconnect the faulty circuit.

\section*{BATTERY CHARGING}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the topic the learner should be able to: -
i) Explain the constant voltage charging methods
- Constant current charging
- Constant voltage charging
- Float battery charging
- Trickle battery charging
ii) Describe the maintenance of various batteries
- Lead-acid cells
- Alkaline cells
- Zinc air

Battery charging methods

A rechargeable battery, storage battery or secondary cell is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged through a load and recharged many times as opposed to a disposable or primary battery, which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use.
Some of the charging methods includes: -
i. Constant current charging method
ii. Constant voltage charging method
iii. Float charging method
iv. Trickle charging method
v. Booster charging method
vi. Taper charging method
vii. Iui charging method
viii. Burp charging method
ix. Pulsed charging method
1. Constant current charging method

The charging current is kept constant by varying the supply voltage to voltage to overcome the increased back e.m.f of cells. If a charging booster (which is just a shunt dynamo directly driven by a motor) is used, the current supplied by it can be kept constant by adjusting its excitations. If charged on a d.c. supply, the current is controlled by varying the rheostat connected in the circuit. The value of charging current should be chosen appropriately to avoid excessive gassing during final stages of charging. This also maintains the cell temperature not avoid 45 degrees Celsius The method takes comparatively longer time.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-58.jpg?height=400&width=868&top_left_y=1402&top_left_x=623)

Figure 9. 1 constant-current charging system

\section*{2. Constant-Voltage charging method}

Here voltage is maintained constant but it results in very large charging current in the beginning when the back e.m.f of the cell is low and a small current when their back e.m.f increases on being charged.
When a secondary cell is being charged, then the e.m.f of the cell acts in opposition to the applied voltage. Taking V as the supply voltage and I as the charging voltage against the back e.m.f $E_{b}$, then input is VI but power send in overcoming the opposition is $E_{b} I$. The power $E_{b} I$ is converted into chemical energy which is stored in the cell.
The charging current is then given as: -
$$I=\frac{V-E_{b}}{R}$$

N/B- by varying R, the charging current can be kept constant throughout

\section*{3. TRICKLE CHARGING METHOD}

A trickle charger is a battery charger that delivers a very low voltage. This means that the battery will be charged slowly over a period of time. In trickle charging method, battery is not connected to the load during charging.
In trickle charging, the charger does not disconnect the battery when fully charged, hence it keeps continuously to maintain the battery fully charged.
Trickle charger charges the battery at the self-discharging rates of the battery.

\section*{4. FLOAT CHARGING METHOD}

Float charging is a technology and method of maintaining a battery in the charged condition by applying a continuous voltage and current at the minimum level to maintain a full or near full charge.
Float charging is most commonly used for backup and emergency power applications where the discharge of the battery is infrequent. During float charging, the charger, the battery and load are connected in parallel. The charger operates off the normal power supply which provides current to the load during charging and operation.
If normal power supply fails, the battery provides backup power until the normal power supply is restored. Float chargers are typical constant-voltage chargers that operates at a low voltage, less than 2.4 volts per cell, keeps the charging current low and thus minimizes the damaging effects of high-current overcharging.

Float charging versus level of charge
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-60.jpg?height=844&width=1639&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=243)

Figure 9.3 a graph of Float charging versus level of charge

\section*{Advantages of float charging method}
- As the battery, charger and load all are connected in parallel so that it is best for backup and emergency purposes, there is no power interruption for the load.
- As here reduced voltage, a low constant current is used so the battery has a high life span.
- Almost no chances of overcharging, overheating, automatic self-discharge or voltage drain.
- Float charger has a very simple circuit design generally a rectifier circuit and a low-cost device.

\section*{Disadvantages of float battery charging}
i. Battery takes more time to charge as it's working with low current charger.
ii. Most suitable for low power and low backup time applications, not suitable for high backup time applications.

\section*{BOOST CHARGING SYSTEM}
- It is a charging method of the battery where a boost voltage (more than float voltage) is applied temporarily to the battery to accept more current as it gets charged fully in a very short time.
- The voltage must be reduced to float voltage once the battery gets fully charged to avoid overcharging.
- Boost charger is mainly designed for fast charging purposes.

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF BOOST CHARGING}
a) Provides very fast or quick charging method.
b) Most suitable for low to high power application.
c) Battery can drive a heavy load such as high torque motors \& actuators.

\section*{DISADVANTAGES OF BOOST CHARGING}
a) High voltage \& current are applied to the battery hence reducing life span of the battery.
b) Not suitable for lead acid batteries hence suitable for LI-ION batteries.
c) It is complex in design since a timer circuit is required to reduce the boost voltage to float voltage when battery is fully charged.

\section*{MAINTENANCE OF LEAD CELLS}
i. Discharging should not be prolonged after the minimum value of the voltage for the particular rate of discharge is reached.
ii. It should not be left in discharge condition for long period of time.
iii. The level of electrolyte should always be 10 mm to 15 mm above the top of the plates which must not be left exposed to air. Evaporation of electrolyte should be made up by adding distilled water occasionally.
iv. Since acid doesn't vaporize, none should be added.
v. Vent openings in the filling plug should be kept open to prevent gases formed within from building a high pressure.
vi. The acid and corrosion on the battery $\square$ top should be washed off with a cloth moistened with baking soda or ammonia and water.
vii. The battery terminals and metal support should be cleaned down to bare metal and covered with vaseline or petroleum jelly.

\section*{MAINTENANCE OF ALKALINE BATTERY}
i. Correctly size your battery.
ii. Periodically check the voltage of your batteries.
iii. Don't try to charge alkaline battery.
iv. Prevent alkaline batteries from leaking.
v. Take care with parallel connection.
vi. Give VRLA batteries breathing space.
vii. Always take care to insert batteries correctly according to the designation of polarity on batteries and the equipment. Place batteries correctly into equipment to avoid short-circuit or be charged. This may result to rise in temperature and venting leading to leakage and explosion.
viii. Don't short-circuit batteries. Avoid direct connection of terminals of batteries to avoid excess current flow instantaneously, which leads to heat generation hence damaging internal structures of the battery.
ix. Don't charge batteries, they are not rechargeable, charging may result to leakage of electrolyte or damage.
x. Do not over discharge batteries.
xi. Don't forcibly discharge, when batteries are discharged by an external power supply, the battery voltage becomes extremely low.
xii. Do not dispose batteries into fire $\square$.
xiii. Exhausted batteries should be immediately removed from equipment's and disposed off properly.
xiv. Avoid crush the batteries.
xv. Don't directly solder the batteries.

$>$ This electromagnetic is also used in the in the operation of electric bell.

\section*{TYPES OF BELLS}

\section*{7. Single stroke bell}

The bell is made up of two coils, usually wound up with varnish-insulated or cotton insulated copper wire wound on an insulated bobbin. The bobbins are fitted on to a U-Shaped soft iron core and the magnetic circuit is completed by a soft-iron strip riveted to spring loaded armature. The armature carries the striker which hits the gong at the end of its movement.

Figure 10. 1 Single-Stroke bell circuit

\section*{Operation}
- Current passes through the coil when the push-button or switch is operated.
- The soft iron strip on the armature is drawn to the electromagnet against the pressure of a flat spring.
- The armature carries a striker which hits the gong.
- When the circuit is broken the coil becomes demagnetized and the spring pulls the armature back into its original position.
- The striker will only operate when the push is operated.

Chimer: the double note chimer is a variation of the single-stroke bell. Tubular chimes replace the gong and the second chime is struck by the re-bound of the striker.

\section*{8. Trembler Bell}

The construction is similar to that of single stroke bell, with the exception of a set of variable contacts at armature which are used to break the circuit when the armature is drawn towards the electromagnet. The contact points are made of German silver to minimize the effect of the
continual arcing during the operation. See the figure above.

\section*{Operation}
- When the push-button switch is operated, the coils form an electromagnet and attract the iron- soft strip.
- The movement of armature to the coil opens the contacts.
- The coil is then demagnetized and the spring pulls the armature back to its original position.
- The cycle is then repeated, giving a continual make and break action.

The speed of the stroke can be varied by varying the contact screw. The buzzer is similar in construction to that of trembler bell, the only difference being the striker and the gong.

\section*{3. Continuous ringing bell}

This bell differs from trembler bell in that a small lever is placed below the contact screw. When the current first flows through the coils the armature is attracted and so releases the catch allowing the contact arm to move under the influence of the auxiliary spring (lever). This (short-circuits) loses the contract thus completing the bell circuit independently of the bell-push and so the bell continues to ring even though the bell push may be released. The bell will continue to ring until the reset cord is pulled

Figure 10.4 continuous ringing bell

\section*{Operation}
- When the bell-push is operated the coil become an electromagnet and the armature is drawn towards them
- The lever drops on the first stroke and shorts the push.
- The bell now operates as a trembler bell.
- To stop the bell, pull the cord thus resetting the lever.

\section*{5. Polarized bell}

This bell operated by an alternating current such as may be obtained from the magnetos used in certain types of telephone circuit. When the current in the coils has one polarity, pole A of the magnet is strengthened and pole B weakened this causes the soft iron armature to pivot so that the striker rings bell 1 . When the current reverses, pole A is weakened and pole B , strengthened, so the armature moves back causing bell 2 to be struck. Thus, the bell produces two chimes for each cycle of alternating current.

\section*{Bell accessories}
1. Bell Pushes and contacts: the push button consists of two contacts, one fixed and one movable. The movable contact is either spring controlled or is itself in the form of a spring and is operated by press- knob or button. Bell contacts are used for a purpose as ringing a bell upon the opening of a door.
2. Bell transformers: the electric bell will operate not only from direct current but also from alternating current. Bell circuits may be supplied using a bell transformer instead of a battery. Class A bell transformers provide a choice of three secondary voltages, 4,8 or 12 volts. Class B bell transformers provide a single secondary voltage of 6 volts. The voltage depends upon the type of bell employed and the length of wiring run in the bell circuit.

\section*{3. Bell Relays:}
> when a bell circuit is long, it may be possible that the voltage drop is great along the wires that the bell may not operate efficiently. In this case, additional cells may be added however, this is not the most efficient solution to the problem. In such conditions, a bell relay is suitable.
$>$ A relay is a pair of electrical contacts operated by an electromagnet. A very small current is sufficient to energize the electromagnet and attracts the spring-controlled armature. The movement of the armature causes the two contacts to close and operate the bell. The relay maybe energized separately from its own supply or it may use the bell supply.
$>$ In normally open (NO) relay type, the contacts remain open until the coil is energized while for normally closed (NC) type, the contacts remain closed as along as the coil is de-energized. Relays are used in industry to control heavy currents from a distance to reduce power loss in the cables. Examples include; control of circuit in power stations, car starter, alarm circuits e.t.c.

\section*{4. Bell circuits}
> The simples possible bell circuit consists of the bell, battery and bell push connected in series.

Figure 10. 5 A simple bell circuit

\section*{IEE Regulations}
i. The transformer must be double-wound.
ii. The core of the transformer (metal case if used) and one point of the winding must be earthed.
iii. The transformer should be connected to a separate sub-circuit and in this event does not require a separate control switch.
iv. The cables used to supply the transformer must be of a grade suitable for the supply the voltage in use.
v. The secondary wiring need only be insulated for extra low voltage provided that it is completely segregated from power and lighting cables. If it is necessary to run the bell circuit wiring in the same conduit or duct as power or lighting.

\section*{BELL INDICATORS}
> A bell circuit is often arranged so that the bell may be operated from any one of a number of bell-pushes. An indicator board may be used to show which bell-push has been operated.
$>$ In this circuit, when any particular push is pressed current flows through the indicator element concerned to the bell.

\section*{Types of Indicators}
i) Pendulum type indicator: the element comprises a single-pole electromagnet with armature. The armature is pivoted to swing freely and colored flag is attached to the lower end. When the current flows through the coil, the armature is attracted. When current ceases the armature is released and the flag will then swing backwards and forwards for some time.
ii) Mechanical replacement indicator: when the current flows through the coil the armature is attracted. This releases the catch and the flag drops. When the current ceases, the armature returns to its normal position owing to the action of the spring, but the flag remains down until it is raised by operating the replacement button.
iii) Electrical replacement type: the element consists of two magnet coils, one of which is in series with the bell circuit. The second coil is connected in the replacement circuit. The armature is pivoted at its center about which it will rock. When current passes through the alarm circuit, one end of the armature is attracted, causing the flag to overbalance and fall to one side. To restore the flag, current is passed through the replacement coil which restores the flag to its original position.

\section*{Sounders}
> These are devices in which electrical signals are converted in to sound e.g. a bell, hooters, sirens etc.
> The types and locations of the sounders should be such the alarms are clearly audible to people using the building.
$>$ They must not have a similar sound to any other device on the premises.

\section*{Buzzers}
> An electric buzzer_uses a similar mechanism to an interrupter bell, but without the resonant bell. They are quieter than bells, but adequate for a warning tone over a small distance, such as across a desktop.
$>$ A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric. Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.
$>$ With the development of low-cost electronics from the 1970s onwards, most buzzers have now been replaced by electronic 'sounders'. These replace the electromechanical striker of a bell with an electronic oscillator and a loudspeaker, often a piezoelectric transducer.

\section*{The Telephone}

\section*{Principle of operation}
$>$ If the resistance of the variable resistor is varied, the current flowing in the circuit (ohm's
law).
These variations in current will cause the variations in in the strength of the electromagnet. Variations in the strength of magnet field will vary the pull on the soft iron diaphragm (or disc). The disc can be made to vibrate by varying the resistance in the circuit.

Figure 10. 6 Telephone, principle of operation

\section*{Microphone and receivers}

\section*{Construction and operation}
i) The transmitter/ microphone converts sound waves into electrical impulses.
$>$ The transmitter/Microphone consists of a sealed chamber containing carbon granules (powdered carbon). The cone-shaped diaphragm presses on the granules which are placed between two electrodes. The diaphragm vibrates whenever sound waves impinge upon it, the vibrations alternately compresses and releases carbon granules which form the connection between the diaphragm and the rear contact. This has the effect of varying the resistance of the microphone in sympathy with the sound waves.
> A transmitter or microphone takes the place of the variable resistor. Variations in the resistance are caused by the pressure of sound waves from the voice acting on the carbon granules thus varying current in the circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-69.jpg?height=372&width=652&top_left_y=1744&top_left_x=788)

Figure 10. 7 The transmitter diagram
ii) The receiver converts electrical impulses into sound waves.
$>$ The receiver (a common form) has mu-metal diaphragm which is held very close to the poles of a permanent magnet. The poles are fitted with coils so that whenever the current in the coils varies the resultant magnetic field strength also varies and so does
the pull on the diaphragm.
$>$ A current of one polarity will increase the pull on the diaphragm while a current of opposite polarity reduces the pull; hence if an alternating current is passed through the coil, the diaphragm moves to and fro in step with current.

Figure 10.9 Comparison between a transmitter \& a receiver
The electromagnet of the receiver changes these variations in current back into sound waves by attracting and repelling the soft-iron diaphragm. The soft iron is used because it does not retain magnetism.

\section*{One-way telephone system}

The figure below shows a circuit which can only transmit sound in one direction only. The battery causes a current to flow through the carbon type transmitter and low resistance primary of the induction coil. When sound waves act on the microphone, the variations in resistance result in variations of current flowing in the microphone. These variations in form of speech current induces a voltage in in the secondary winding (has more turns than primary one thus amplifying the current to a large value enough to be transmitted over a long transmission line) of the induction coil.

The induced secondary voltage causes a speech current to flow in the receiver circuit and so the receiver will reproduce the original sound wave.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-71.jpg?height=581&width=1026&top_left_y=344&top_left_x=544)

Figure 10. 10 simple Telephone Circuit

\section*{Two-way telephone system}

The figure below shows how a more advanced circuit required to offer a two-way speech communication-and method of ringing can be achieved.

In this circuit, the calling switch C , is held against the top contact by a spring and the hook switch H at the down the weight of the receiver. At each stage, the line at station is connected to a bell. If the call switch is pressed at station A, current flows from B2 to the bell at station B and similarly when pressed at station B. Thus, a caller at one station can attracts attention of the person on the other end.
When the receivers at each end are lifted up, the hook switches rise and so make a connection to the sound receiving and transmitting apparatus. Speech currents from either of the transmitters can now cause voltages to be induced in their respective induction coils which will operate the receivers at each end.

A 'Pressel' switch P, is included in each microphone circuit to save current when the apparatus is not in use.

\section*{Burglar and Fire alarm systems}
$>$ Burglar is a type of circuit in whereby the alarm bell is rung when a door-type contact is closed by opening of a window or door. The system is more of like a fire alarm system to bring to notice of any intruder.
> Fire alarms: All premises which come under the factories act must have installation to give warning of fire.

A work system may include a number of hard operated alarm switches, commonly of break glass type, automatic fire detectors at suitable points, alarm bells, and a fire indicator board. The electrical supply may be mains supply voltage, extra-low a.c voltage or trickle-charge accumulators.

\section*{Types of alarm circuits}

\section*{i) Open circuit}

The figure below shows a continuous ringing circuit, which can be as well used as alarm circuit by use of several bell pushes wired in parallel. This is known as 'open circuit' The closing of any detector point sounds the alarm bells to ring continuously.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-73.jpg?height=654&width=1096&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=501)

Figure 10. 12 A circuit to provide Continuous Ringing Action

\section*{Advantages}
- The circuit is simple.
- No current is consumed on stand-by.
- A broken connection or conductor will not result in false alarm.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- No indication is given if there is a break in the circuit which makes part or all of the system in operative.
- A short circuit between conductors may produce false alarm.
- The detector points are not monitored for breaks in the cable.

\section*{ii) Closed circuit}

This circuit employs a relay which is normally energized by the current flowing around a closed circuit. The opening of any detector de-energizes the relay and the closing of its contacts sounds the alarm bells. This circuit employs a relay with one 'normally closed' contact A and one 'normally open' contact B. In normal use, current flows through the alarm contacts, contact B of the relay and relay coil thus remaining energized condition so that contact A is kept open while b is closed. When any of the alarm contacts are operated, current in the relay coil is interrupted so that releasing the relay armature. This closes contact A and
rings the bell while contact B opens breaking the relay coil current. As B is open the relay cannot be energized again even if the alarm contact closes so that the bell continues to ring $r$ until the alarm contacts is returned to normal and reset button pressed.

Figure 10. 13 Closed alarm circuit system

\section*{Advantages}
- The circuit is simple
- The detector points are monitored.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Current is consumed continuously on stand-by.
- No indication is given if there is a break in the circuit which makes part or all of the system in operative.
- A short circuit between conductors may produce false alarm.

\section*{Detectors}
1. Manual fire detection is the oldest method of detection. In the simplest form, a person yelling can provide fire warning. In buildings, however, a person's voice may not always transmit throughout the structure. For this reason, manual alarm stations are installed. The
general design philosophy is to place stations within reach along paths of escape. It is for this reason that they can usually be found near exit doors in corridors and large rooms.

The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system. They are simple devices, and can be highly reliable when the building is occupied. The key disadvantage of manual stations is that they will not work when the building is unoccupied. They may also be used for malicious alarm activations. Nonetheless, they are an important component in any fire alarm system.
$>$ Automatic detectors operate at any time, day or night. A detector comprises a bimetallic strip which bends when heated to a predetermined temperature. A latch is released which allows a mercury switch to tilt and thus close the alarm circuit. The detectors are normally fixed to celling away from accidental or other damage at about 6 m intervals. They must be carefully sited away from direct sunlight, hot pipes or heating appliances.
$>$ Automatic detectors are meant to imitate one or more of the human senses of touch, smell or sight. Thermal detectors are similar to our ability to identify high temperatures, smoke detectors replicate the sense of smell, and flame detectors are electronic eyes. The properly selected and installed automatic detector can be a highly reliable fire sensor.
2. Thermal detectors are the oldest type of automatic detection device, having origin in the mid 1800's, with several styles still in production today.
> The most common units are fixed temperature devices that operate when the room reaches a predetermined temperature (usually in the $135^{\circ}-165^{\circ} \mathrm{F} / 57^{\circ}-74^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). The second most common type of thermal sensor is the rate-of-rise detector, which identifies an abnormally fast temperature climb over a short time period. Both of these units are "spot type" detectors, which means that they are periodically spaced along a ceiling or high on a wall.
$>$ The third detector type is the fixed temperature line type detector, which consists of two cables and an insulated sheathing that is designed to breakdown when exposed to heat.

The advantage of line type over spot detection is that thermal sensing density can be increased at lower cost.
$>$ Thermal detectors are highly reliable and have good resistance to operation from nonhostile sources. They are also very easy and inexpensive to maintain. On the down side, they do not function until room temperatures have reached a substantial temperature, at which point the fire is well underway and damage is growing exponentially.

Subsequently, thermal detectors are usually not permitted in life safety applications. They are also not recommended in locations where there is a desire to identify a fire before substantial flames occur, such as spaces where high value thermal sensitive contents are housed.
3. Smoke detectors are a much newer technology, having gained wide usage during the 1970's and 1980's in residential and life safety applications. As the name implies, these devices are designed to identify a fire while in its smoldering or early flame stages, replicating the human sense of smell.
> The most common smoke detectors are spot type units, that are placed along ceilings or high on walls in a manner similar to spot thermal units. They operate on either an ionization or photoelectric principle, with each type having advantages in different applications. For large open spaces such as galleries and atria, a frequently used smoke detector is a projected beam unit.
> This detector consists of two components, a light transmitter and a receiver, that are mounted at some distance (up to $300 \mathrm{ft} / 100 \mathrm{~m}$ ) apart. As smoke migrates between the two components, the transmitted light beam becomes obstructed and the receiver is no longer able to see the full beam intensity. This is interpreted as a smoke condition, and the alarm activation signal is transmitted to the fire alarm panel.
> A third type of smoke detector, which has become widely used in extremely sensitive applications, is the air aspirating system. This device consists of two main components: a control unit that houses the detection chamber, an aspiration fan and operation circuitry; and a network of sampling tubes or pipes. Along the pipes are a series of ports that are designed to permit air to enter the tubes and be transported to the detector.
> Under normal conditions, the detector constantly draws an air sample into the detection chamber, via the pipe network. The sample is analyzed for the existence of smoke, and then returned to atmosphere.
$>$ If smoke becomes present in the sample, it is detected and an alarm signal is transmitted to the main fire alarm control panel. Air aspirating detectors are extremely sensitive and are typically the fastest responding automatic detection method. Many high technology organizations, such as telephone companies, have standardized on aspiration systems. In cultural properties they are used for areas such as collections storage vaults and highly valuable rooms. These are also frequently used in aesthetically sensitive applications since components are often easier to conceal, when compared to other detection methods.
$>$ The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient. As such, they provide added opportunity for emergency personnel to respond and control the developing fire before severe damage occurs.
$>$ They are usually the preferred detection method in life safety and high content value applications. The disadvantage of smoke detectors is that they are usually more expensive to install, when compared to thermal sensors, and are more resistant to inadvertent alarms. However, when properly selected and designed, they can be highly reliable with a very low probability of false alarm.
4. Flame detectors represent the third major type of automatic detection method, and imitate the human sense of sight. They are line of sight devices that operate on either an infrared, ultraviolet or combination principle. As radiant energy in the approximate 4,000 to 7,700 angstroms range occurs, as indicative of a flaming condition, their sensing equipment recognizes the fire signature and sends a signal to the fire alarm panel.

The advantage of flame detection is that it is extremely reliable in a hostile environment. They are usually used in high value energy and transportation applications where other detectors would be subject to spurious activation. Common uses include locomotive and aircraft maintenance facilities, refineries and fuel loading platforms, and mines.
> A disadvantage is that they can be very expensive and labor intensive to maintain. Flame detectors must be looking directly at the fire source, unlike thermal and smoke
detectors which can identify migrating fire signatures. Their use in cultural properties is extremely limited.

\section*{Fire alarm devices detects the following;}
- Air temperature change
- Combustion products e.g. smoke
- Radiation of electromagnetic waves either infrared or UV rays

\section*{Intruder detection devices uses;}
- Pressure pads for vulnerable areas e.g. underfloor and covers,
- Micro-switches fitted entrance and windows
- Proximity capacitor devices
- Passive infra-red electromagnetic radiations which will activate when interrupted by movement or slight body heat.

\section*{Proximity switches/sensors}

A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks for changes in the field or return signal.
$>$ The object being sensed is often referred to as the proximity sensor's target. Different proximity sensor targets demands different sensors. For example, a capacitive proximity sensor or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always requires a metal target

\section*{Wiring requirements}

Suitable wiring systems include;
i) MIMS (PVC-sheathed for damp and corrosive conditions)
ii) PVC-insulated cables in metal conduit, duct or trunking or rigid PVC conduit.
iii) PVC armoured cables
iv) Insulated and sheathed cables surface laid where continuous monitoring is used.

\section*{Manual Call points}

Manual call points for fire only are usually of the 'BREAK THE GLASS' type and are coloured red.

Call points are to be located so that no one has to travel for more than 30 m from any position within the premises in order to raise the alarm. They should be located on exit routes particularly on floor landings of staircases and on exit streets.

They should be fixed at a height of 1.4 m above the floor at easily accessible, well illuminated, conspicuous positions free from obstruction.

\section*{Safety requirements.}
- As required for extra low voltage circuit to be kept apart from other circuits supplied directly from mains, so it is with the alarm circuits.
- Fire alarm installations should be kept completely separated from the wiring of any other circuit and as far as possible should not follow a common route with other cables.
- For loud ringing alarm bells maybe operated from the mains however, the conduit entry for the wiring should be provided together with an earthing terminal.

\section*{IEE regulations}
i. All new installations should be inspected and tested to ensure that work has done satisfactorily and to the required standard.
ii. Earth connections should be tested in accordance with IEE regulations and the insulation resistance between conductors and earth tested with a 500 V tester, minimum resistance 0.5 m Ohms.
iii. Fire alarms and emergency should not be drawn into the same enclosures with other circuits. They must be separated by metallic barriers when placed in common trunking or ducting or run in separate conduits. This is to ensure that spread of fire does not put the circuit out of action.
iv. Cables operating at extra low voltages such as those for bells must be run separately from mains (low) voltage circuits unless they are insulated to the same value.

\section*{KNEC QUESTIONS}
4. a) (Oct/nov- 2014) Explain why double wound transformers are used in bell circuits

This is the type of transformer used for domestic bell circuits. The transformer consists of two separate windings. These windings are electrically isolated from each other and therefore provide a safe output voltage which is totally isolated from the mains supply.
