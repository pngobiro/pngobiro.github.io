                        <p><dfn>A rechargeable battery, storage battery or secondary cell</dfn> is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged through a load and recharged many times as opposed to a disposable or primary battery, which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use.<br>

                        1. <dfn>Constant current charging method</dfn></p>
                        <p>The charging current is kept constant by varying the supply voltage to voltage to overcome the increased back e.m.f of cells. If a charging booster (which is just a shunt dynamo directly driven by a motor) is used, the current supplied by it can be kept constant by adjusting its excitations. If charged on a d.c. supply, the current is controlled by varying the rheostat connected in the circuit. The value of charging current should be chosen appropriately to avoid excessive gassing during final stages of charging. This also maintains the cell temperature not avoid 45 degrees Celsius The method takes comparatively longer time.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Float charging</dfn> is a technology and method of maintaining a battery in the charged condition by applying a continuous voltage and current at the minimum level to maintain a full or near full charge.<br>
                        Float charging is most commonly used for backup and emergency power applications where the discharge of the battery is infrequent. During float charging, the charger, the battery and load are connected in parallel. The charger operates off the normal power supply which provides current to the load during charging and operation.<br>
                        If normal power supply fails, the battery provides backup power until the normal power supply is restored. Float chargers are typical constant-voltage chargers that operates at a low voltage, less than 2.4 volts per cell, keeps the charging current low and thus minimizes the damaging effects of high-current overcharging.</p>

                        iii. Don't try to charge alkaline battery.<br>
                        iv. Prevent alkaline batteries from leaking.<br>
                        v. Take care with parallel connection.<br>
                        vi. Give VRLA batteries breathing space.<br>
                        vii. Always take care to insert batteries correctly according to the designation of polarity on batteries and the equipment. Place batteries correctly into equipment to avoid short-circuit or be charged. This may result to rise in temperature and venting leading to leakage and explosion.<br>
                        viii. Don't short-circuit batteries. Avoid direct connection of terminals of batteries to avoid excess current flow instantaneously, which leads to heat generation hence damaging internal structures of the battery.<br>
                        ix. Don't charge batteries, they are not rechargeable, charging may result to leakage of electrolyte or damage.<br>
                        x. Do not over discharge batteries.<br>
                        xi. Don't forcibly discharge, when batteries are discharged by an external power supply, the battery voltage becomes extremely low.<br>
                        xii. Do not dispose batteries into fire $\square$.<br>
                        xiii. Exhausted batteries should be immediately removed from equipment's and disposed off properly.<br>
                        xiv. Avoid crush the batteries.<br>
                        xv. Don't directly solder the batteries.</p>
