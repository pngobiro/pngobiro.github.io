                        i. <dfn>Consumer Earthing Terminal</dfn>: -it is a terminal fixed at the consumer's control unit (C.C.U) at the intake point. The terminal is directly attached to the casing of the consumer's intake point without any point of insulation. It connects both the earth Continuity Conductor (E.C.C.) from electrical appliances and accessories and the earthing lead, electrode to the general mass of the earth.<br>
                        ii. <dfn>Earthing lead</dfn>: - It connects the consumer's earthing terminal to the earthing electrode that is fixed in the general mass of the earth. The earthing lead is made of copper and sizes to be used are given in a table provided by the IEE regulations subject to a maximum of $70 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. For this reason, the connection of earth leakage circuit breaker of a cross-sectional area of $25 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ need to be exceeded. The connection of an earthing lead to the earthing electrode must be accessible but mechanically protected from mechanical damage by use of either PVC/ Steel conduits where applicable. Joining should be professionally soldered, or clamped. Copper clad, aluminium conductors shall not be used.<br>
                        iii. <dfn>Earthing electrode</dfn>: - refers to as a metal rod or rods, a system of underground metal pipes or other conducting objects. Used for providing an effectual connection with the general mass of the earth, and is buried in the ground.<br>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>a) Plates: -generally made of copper, zinc, steel or cast iron and may be the solid type or lattice type. Because of their mass, they have to be costly with steel or cast-iron type. Care must be taken to prevent corrosion of plates and are generally installed at the edge of houses in the ground (verandas of houses) to about a depth of 2.3 metres deep. The plates are installed relatively very near the surface of the ground which leads to resistance fluctuations due to seasonal changes throughout the year.<br>
                        b) Rods: - they are less costly than other electrodes to install. They don't require much space, convenient to test and do not create large voltage gradient because the earth fault current is dissipated vertically.<br>
                        - Deeply installed rods are not subject to seasonal resistance changes. The solid copper rods give excellent conductivity and is resistant to corrosion, but its not ideal for driving into deep soil as its soft and may bend when it comes into contact with an obstacle.<br>
                        - The bimetallic rod has a steel core-card and copper on them. The steel core gives the necessary rigidity and copper extremely gives good conductivity and high resistance to corrosion.<br>
                        c) Strips: - copper strips used where the soil is shallow and outlies rocks. It should be buried in a trench to a depth of not less than 50 cm and should be not used where there is a possibility of the ground being disturbed e.g. on farmland. The strip electrode is most effective if buried in clinches under hedge rooms where the biological action arising from the decay or vegetation maintains a conducive soil resistance.<br>
                        d) The earth mats: - it consists of copper buried in trenches up to 1 m deep. The mat can be laid out either linearly or in start-form and terminated at the down leads from the transformer or other items or equipment to be earthed. The total length of conduction used can be expensive. The most common areas where this system is used are where rocks are present near the surface of the soil, making deep excavation impracticable. As with the plate electrodes, this method of earthing is subject to seasonal changes in resistance.<br>
                        e) The cable sheaths: - these form a metallic return path and are provided by the supply undertaking. They are particularly useful where an extensive underground cable system is available, the combination of sheath and armoring forms a mass effective earth electrode. In most cases, the resistance to earth of such a system is less than $1 \Omega$, cable sheath is $\qquad$ more used to provide a direct metallic connection for the return of earth fault current to the neutral of a supply system rather as means of direct connection with earth; thus, even though such cables are served with gradual deterioration of the final jute or hessian serving.</p>

                        - This form of earthing is also known as continuous neutral earthing [C.N.E.]. The system uses the neutral of the mains power supply as the earthing point in all the protected metal-work in an installation to this common point.<br>
                        - The consumers earthing terminals, all on to earth, first are converted to neutral points, with an intention to ensure that sufficient current flows under fault conditions to operate the excess current protective devices. There are two main hazards associated with protective multiple earthing (P.M.E] system.<br>
                        - First, due to the increased earth fault current is encouraged to flow; there is an enhanced fire risk during the time it takes for the protective device to operate. Also, it's essential to ensure that the neutral conductor cannot rise up to dangerous potential with respect to earth. This is because the interconnection of neutral and protective metal-work would automatically extend<br>
                        the resultant shock risk to all the protected metalwork on every installation connected to this particular supply distribution network.<br>
                        - Due to this hazard, the following requirements must be met: -<br>
                        a) The neutral conductor must be earthed at a number of points in the systems and the maximum resistance from neutral to earth must not exceed $10 \Omega$. An earth electrode should also be installed at every consumers installation.<br>
                        b) There must be no fusible cut-out, single pole switch, removable links or automatic circuit breakers in the neutral conductor in the consumers installation.<br>
                        c) The neutral conductor at any point must be made of same materials and be at least of equal cross-sectional area as the phase conductor.<br>
                        - P.M.E. can only be applied to a consumer's installation, if the supply authority's feeder is multiple earthed.</p>

                        <p>- A rewireable fuse is a simple and relatively cheaper type of over-current protective device.<br>
                        - It consists of a porcelain bridge and a fuse base.<br>
                        - The fusing/fuse element is connected between the terminals of the bridge.<br>
                        - An asbestos tube is fitted in the fuse to minimize the effects of arcing formed when the fuse element melts.<br>
                        - The fusing factor of a rewireable fuse is roughly 2 with a protective asbestos pad which eventually reduces the factor to 1.9 . This implies that a fuse-element rated at 10A will melt when $10 \times 2=20 \mathrm{~A}$ flows in the circuit. It also implies that a $1.00 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ conductor (which has a current rating of 11 A ) may, in an overload condition, be made to carry as much as 50 percent overload without the fuse coming into action; the cable is thus run on overload which may lead eventually to a fault.</p>

                        b) It is easy to replace the fusing element.<br>
                        c) It is simple in construction.</p>

                        <p>a. The ease with which an inexperienced person can replace a 'blown' fuse element with a wire of incorrect gauge or type.<br>
                        b. It takes time before blowing or melting hence it can cause physical damage to circuit conductors and equipment's being protected.<br>
                        c. It doesn't offer discrimination between a surge and a continuous fault current; - this means it is possible, in certain installation conditions, for a 15A fuse-element to melt before a 10A fuse-element. Also, a rewireable fuse is not capable of discriminating between a momentary high current e.g. motor starting current and a continuous fault current.<br>
                        d. It's very difficult to know the rating, this renders this fuse unsuitable for circuits which requires discrimination protection.<br>
                        e. The fuse element is always at a fairly high temperatures when in use, this leads to it's oxidization hence the fuse element deteriorates very fast.<br>
                        f. They are classified by offering course and close excess current protection i.e., the device will take longer than 4 hours to come into operation when a current of 1.5 times the designed low current of the associated circuit flows through the fuse element.</p>

                        $\checkmark$ The normal current it will have to carry,<br>
                        $\checkmark$ The amount of current which the supply system will feed into the circuit fault.<br>

                        - They are to provide a closer and more accurate degree of excess current protection.<br>
                        - The circuit breaker has a mechanism which when it is in a closed position, holds the contact together. The contacts are separated when the release mechanism of a circuit breaker is operated by hand or automatically by magnetic or thermal means.</p>

                        <p>- It employs a solenoid which is a coil with an iron slug. The normal circuit current which flows through the coil is not sufficiently strong to produce a significant magnetic flux.<br>
                        - As the circuit current increases the magnetic field strength increases to cause the iron slug to move within the solenoid and collapses the attached tripping linkage to open the contact.</p>

                        <p>- It uses a heat sensitive bimetallic element. When the element is heated to a predetermined temperature, the resultant deflection is arranged to trip the circuit breakers.<br>
                        - The time taken to heat the element to this temperature provides the necessary time-delay characteristics.<br>
                        - The bimetal element may be arranged to carry the circuit current, and so be directly heated. When a heavier overload occurs, the magnetic trip coil operates quickly to disconnect the faulty circuit.<br>
