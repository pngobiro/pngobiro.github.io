                        <p><dfn>A hydro-electric power station</dfn> refers to a generating station which utilizes the potential energy of water at a high level for the generation of electrical energy.<br>
                        - Hydro-electric power stations are generally located in hilly areas where dams can be built conveniently and large water reservoirs can be obtained.<br>
                        - In a hydro-electric power station, water head is created by constructing a dam across a river or lake. From the dam, water is led to a water turbine.<br>
                        - The water turbine captures the energy in the falling water and changes the hydraulic energy (i.e., product of head and flow of water) into mechanical energy at the turbine shaft.<br>
                        - The turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The depletion and the reservation of coal &amp; oil has promoted hydro-electric power stations in the world today.<br>
                        - They have the added importance for flood control, storage of water for irrigation and water for drinking purposes.</p>

                        <p>Although a hydro-electric power station simply involves the conversion of hydraulic energy into electrical energy, yet it embraces many arrangements for proper working and efficiency as shown below.</p>

                        <p>Figure 3.1 schematic arrangement of Hydro-electric power station<br>
                        A dam is constructed across the river or lake and a water catchment area collects at the back of the dam to form a reservoir. A pressure tunnel is taken off from the reservoir to direct water to the valve house at the start of the penstock. The valve house contains the main sluice valves &amp; automatic isolating valves. The former controls the water flow to the power house and the latter cuts off supply of water when the penstock bursts. From the valve house, water is taken to water turbine through a huge steel pipe known as penstock. The water turbine converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. The turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.<br>
                        A surge tank (open from top) is built just before the valve house and protects the penstock from bursting in case the turbine gates suddenly close due to electrical load being thrown off. When the gates close, there is a sudden stopping of water at the lower end of the penstock and consequently the penstock can burst like a paper log. The surge tank absorbs this pressure swing by increase in its level of water.</p>

                        i) <dfn>Dam</dfn>; - this is a barrier which stores water and creates water head. Dams are built of concrete or stone masonry, earth or rock fill.<br>
                        ii) <dfn>Spillways</dfn>: - during heavy rainfalls, a times the river flow exceeds the storage capacity of the reservoir. In order to discharge the surplus water from the reservoir, a spillway is used to get the surplus water down the stream.<br>
                        iii) <dfn>Headworks</dfn>: - they are diversion structures at the head of water intake point. They are used for smooth controlling of water flow to the turbines.<br>

                        - <dfn>Francis turbines</dfn> - used for low to medium heads. It consists of an outer ring of stationary guide blades fixed to the turbine casing and an inner ring of rotating blades forming the runner. The guide blades control the flow of water to the turbine.<br>
                        - <dfn>Kaplan turbines</dfn> - is used for low heads and large quantities of water. It is similar to Francis turbine except that the runner of Kaplan turbine receives water axially.<br>
                        Electrical equipment. They include the following; - alternators, transformers, circuit breakers and other switching and protective devices.</p>

                        ii) <dfn>A regenerator</dfn>: - is a device which recovers heat from the exhaust gases of the turbine. The exhaust is passed through the regenerator before wasting to atmosphere. A regenerator consists of a nest of tubes contained in a shell.<br>
                        iii) <dfn>Combustion chamber</dfn>: - The air at high pressure from the compressor is led to the combustion chamber via the regenerator. In the combustion chamber, heat* is added to the air by burning oil.<br>
                        iv) <dfn>Gas turbine</dfn>: - The products of combustion consisting of a mixture of gases at high temperature and pressure are passed to the gas turbine. These gases in passing over the turbine blades expand and thus do the mechanical work.</p>

This type of power station is not found very often, because it requires a resource that produces dry steam, but is the most efficient, with the simplest facilities. In these sites, there may be liquid water present in the reservoir, but no water is produced to the surface, only steam. Dry Steam Power directly uses geothermal steam of $150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or greater to turn turbines. As the turbine rotates it powers a generator which then produces electricity and adds to the power field. Then, the steam is emitted to a condenser. Here the steam turns back into a liquid which then cools the water. After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that conducts the condensate back into deep wells, where it can be reheated and produced again.</p>

Flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than $360^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ($182^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$). The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource.</p>

                     <h3 id="topic-3-advantages-geothermal-heading" class="subsection-heading">Advantages</h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>a) Comparatively ecologically clean. Unlike coal-fired power plants, geothermal ones use a renewable heat source with a constant supply. The amount of greenhouse gas from geothermal power plants is only 5% in the contrary with coal-fired power plants.<br>
                        b) More energy. Geothermal power stations have great capacity - they can gravely help in meeting the demand for energy that grows every year, both in developed and developing countries.<br>
                        c) Stable prices. Simple power plants depend on fuel, so the cost of their electricity is varying, based on the market price of fuel. Since geothermal power plants do not use fuel, they do not need to consider its cost, and they can offer their customers stable electricity costs.<br>
                        d) Low operating costs. Geothermal installations require minimal maintenance compared to conventional power plants. As a result, they are reliable and cheap in operation.<br>
                        e) Renewable and sustainable source. Geothermal energy will never end, unlike nonrenewable energy sources. As long as the earth supports our lives, geothermal energy will exist and geothermal power will work.<br>
                        f) Permanent power supply. Unlike other renewable energy sources, geothermal one can provide a constant supply of energy - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, regardless of external factors. For example, solar panels can produce electricity only during the day, and wind turbines produce energy only with sufficient wind.<br>
                        g) Small area. They occupy less space than their coal, oil and gas equivalents. Although they will reach far below the earth's surface, their area will be negligible.<br>
                        h) Low noise work. There is a little noise in the production of geothermal energy. The main source of noise is the fans that are in the cooling systems. To reduce its level, engineers can install in the generator shops materials with high damping properties. It helps to reduce noise pollution.<br>
                        i) Energy security. Using local geothermal resources, the need to supply sources from other countries reduces, which, in turn, lowers dependence on external influences and helps to increase our energy security.</p>

                        <p>a) Ecological problem. High environmental consumption of fresh water can be a loss for the environment, which will ultimately lead to its deficit. Liquids extracted from the earth during drilling contain a large number of toxic chemicals (including arsenic and mercury), as well as greenhouse gases (such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and radon). If they are incorrectly disposed or treated, they can get into the atmosphere or leak into groundwater and damage the environment and human health.<br>
                        b) Geographical limits. Geothermal activity is the highest along the tectonic fault lines in the earth's crust. Exactly in these places the geothermal energy has the greatest potential. The drawback is that only few countries can use geothermal resources. Therefore, while having a look at their geographical peculiarities, such countries are the main producers of geothermal energy: the USA, Iceland, Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico<br>
                        c) Seismic instability. There are reasons to believe that geothermal structures have caused underground shakings in different parts of the world. Despite the fact that seismic activity is often insignificant, it can lead to building damage, injuries and death.<br>
                        d) Expensive construction. Geothermal power plants requires significant investments.</p>
                        <p>Although they have low operating costs, the cost of their construction may be much higher than coal, oil and gas plants. Much of these expenses concerns the exploration and drilling of geothermal energy resources. What is more, geothermal power plants require specially developed heating and cooling systems, as well as other equipment that can withstand high temperatures.<br>
                        e) Possible exhaustion. Studies show that without careful management, geothermal tanks can be exhausted. In such cases, the geothermal power plant will become unnecessary until the tank is restored. The only inexhaustible option is to get geothermal energy directly from the magma, but this technology is still in the process of development. This option is worth investing at least because the magma will exist billions of years.</p>

                        - Wind energy is a renewable source of energy. Wind is naturally occurring and there is no way we can empty the energy resources. Wind energy actually originates from the nuclear fusion processes that take place on the sun.<br>
                        - Space efficient. The wind turbines can't be placed too close to each other, but the land inbetween can be used for other things.<br>
                        - Although wind power only accounts for about $\mathbf{2.5\%}$ of total worldwide electricity production, the capacity is growing at an incredible rate of 25% per year (2010). This does not only contribute in the fight against global warming, but also helps lowering costs:<br>
                        - Prices have decreased over $\mathbf{80\%}$ since 1980. Thanks to technological advancements and increased demand, prices are expected keep decreasing in the foreseeable future.<br>
                        - It is generally true that operational costs tend to be low once the turbines first have been manufactured and erected. However, not every wind turbine is created equal some are more susceptible to maintenance than others.</p>

                        the generated 11 kV is stepped up to 132 kV or more at the generating station with the help of 3-phase transformers. The transmission at high voltages has several advantages such as saving of conductor material and high transmission efficiency.<br>
                        ii) <dfn>Primary transmission</dfn>: The electric power at 132 kV is transmitted by 3phase, 3-wire overhead system to the outskirts of the city. This forms the primary transmission.<br>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The electric power can be transmitted either by means of d.c. or a.c. Each system has its own merits and demerits. It is, therefore, desirable to discuss the technical advantages and disadvantages of the two systems for transmission of electric power.<br>
                        1. D.C. transmission. For some years past, the transmission of electric power by d.c. has been receiving the active consideration of engineers due to its numerous advantages. Advantages; - The high voltage d.c. transmission has the following advantages over high voltage a.c. transmission:
                        i) It requires only two conductors as compared to three for a.c. transmission.<br>
                        ii) There is no inductance, capacitance, phase displacement and surge problems in d.c. transmission.<br>
                        iii) Due to the absence of inductance, the voltage drops in a d.c. transmission line is less than the a.c. line for the same load and sending end voltage. For this reason, a d.c. transmission line has better voltage regulation.<br>
                        iv) There is no skin effect in a d.c. system. Therefore, entire cross-section of the line conductor is utilized.<br>
                        v) For the same working voltage, the potential stress on the insulation is less in case of d.c. system than that in a.c. system. Therefore, a d.c. line requires less insulation.<br>
                        vi) A d.c. line has less corona loss and reduced interference with communication circuits.<br>
                        vii) The high voltage d.c. transmission is free from the dielectric losses, particularly in the case of cables.<br>
                        viii) In d.c. transmission, there are no stability problems and synchronising difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages<br>
                        i) Electric power cannot be generated at high d.c. voltage due to commutation problems.<br>
                        ii) The d.c. voltage cannot be stepped up for transmission of power at high voltages.<br>
                        iii) The d.c. switches and circuit breakers have their own limitations.<br>
                        2. A.C. transmission; - Now-a-days, electrical energy is almost exclusively generated, transmitted and distributed in the form of a.c.</p>
                        <p>Advantages<br>
                        i) The power can be generated at high voltages.<br>
                        ii) The maintenance of a.c. sub-stations is easy and cheaper.<br>
                        iii) The a.c. voltage can be stepped up or stepped down by transformers with ease and efficiency. This permits to transmit power at high voltages and distribute it at safe potentials.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages<br>
                        i) An a.c. line requires more copper than a d.c. line.<br>
                        ii) The construction of a.c. transmission line is more complicated than a d.c. transmission line.<br>
                        iii) Due to skin effect in the a.c. system, the effective resistance of the line is increased.<br>
                        iv) An a.c. line has capacitance. Therefore, there is a continuous loss of power due to charging current even when the line is open</p>

                        <p>From the above discussion, it might appear advisable to use the highest possible voltage for transmission of power in a bid to save conductor material. However, it must be realized that high transmission voltage results in; -<br>
                        - the increased cost of insulating the conductors,<br>
                        - the increased cost of transformers, switchgear and other terminal apparatus.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, there is a limit to the higher transmission voltage which can be economically employed in a particular case. This limit is reached when the saving in cost of conductor material due to higher voltage is offset by the increased cost of insulation, transformer, switchgear etc. Hence, the choice of proper transmission voltage is essentially a question of economics.</p>
