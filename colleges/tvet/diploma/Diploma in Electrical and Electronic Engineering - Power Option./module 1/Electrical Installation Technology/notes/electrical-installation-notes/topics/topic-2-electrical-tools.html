                        <p><dfn>A tool</dfn> is an instrument used by a person to perform a task. They enable one to perform many tasks which would be extremely difficult without them. A practicing electrician and an electrical craftsman are concerned and the most compelled person to use electrical tools and build up his or she during the years of training.</p>

                        - <dfn>Hacksaw</dfn>: - originally and principally made for cutting metals, but can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with the hacksaw.<br>
                        - <dfn>Stock and die</dfn>: - stock and die are tools used to create screwing threads on steel conduits for easier joining of steel conduits and the steel boxes. This process of is known as threading.<br>
                        - <dfn>Side cutter pliers</dfn>: - useful for cutting copper, brass, iron, aluminium and steel conductors and wires.<br>
                        - <dfn>Long nose pliers</dfn>: - used for both cutting and bending, re-position and snip wires. Their name sake long nose gives excellent control while the cutting edge near the plier's joint provides one- tool convenience. Because of their long shape they are useful for reaching into small areas where cables or other materials have become stuck or unreachable with fingers or other means.</p>

                        <p>d) A flat chisel is a general-purpose tool.<br>
                        e) Cross-cut chisel is used for grooving materials, cutting keyway slot and for cutting places where the flat chisel is not convenient<br>
                        vii) <dfn>File</dfn>: - is a cutting tool. The most usual form of file that has cross-cut teeth i.e. the groove of the face of file run into direction dividing small diameter of teeth. The single cut file has only one series of group.<br>
                        Types of files<br>
                        i. <dfn>Flat file</dfn>: - is parallel for about $2/3^{6}$ of its length and..., ........ It is used for cutting on both faces and both edges.<br>
                        ii. <dfn>The hand file</dfn>: - has a parallel width throughout its length. Bot faces are double cut, one edge is only......... The safe (the uncut edge) prevents cutting into or a square corner while the face has been filed. Both the hand and flat file are used for general purpose. Hand file used when filing up to increase sharpness of other tools, it must be kept straight and square.<br>
                        iii. <dfn>Square file</dfn>: - it is parallel for two thirds $2/3\ldots$... It has double cutting on all sides and is used for filling corners and slots where a hand file cannot enter.<br>
                        iv. <dfn>Round file tapers</dfn>: - as does square file: it is used for filing out holes producing rounded corners, round-ended.<br>
                        v. <dfn>The three-square file</dfn>: - is used for corners less than one position where awkward corners have to be taken and are graded as rough, bastard, second cut, smooth.<br>
                        viii) <dfn>The scrapper</dfn>: - the flat scrapper resembles the file but is used...... Metal is removed from a surface by scrapping rather than cutting.<br>
                        ix) <dfn>The conduits vice</dfn>: - is used for holding work piece while it is being operated on. There are two types of vices in electrical workshop which are: -<br>
                        a) <dfn>Bench vice</dfn>: - used for bench work.<br>
                        b) <dfn>Pipe vice</dfn>: - used for holding pipework and is probably looks more familiar vice to the electrician outride workshop.<br>
                        x) <dfn>The hammer</dfn>: - there are many shapes of hammer heads, each designed for a specific type of work. The striking face is called pen.<br>
                        Types of hammer<br>
                        - They include the following<br>
                        i. <dfn>Ball pen hammer</dfn>: - used for rivoting over the ends of pins and riven<br>
                        ii. <dfn>Engineer's hammer</dfn>: - are made in weights varying from 100 g to $1/2 \mathrm{~kg}$. When choosing a hammer, you choose according to the weight.<br>
                        iii. <dfn>Light hammer</dfn>: - are used for lighter and more delicate operations such as center punches, riveting, driving in small pins.<br>

                        <p>i) All tools should receive regular care and attention at frequent intervals through their working life.<br>
                        ii) This is necessary if the tools are expected to perform their duties effectively and efficiently.<br>
                        iii) A tool need sharpening at the edge where it becomes full.<br>
                        iv) Hammer heads become loose and require tightening.<br>
                        v) Screwdriver blades become distorted and tapered and need grounded carefully to restore and efficient working edges.<br>
                        vi) Twist drill require grinding correctly for quick, clean and accurate work.<br>
                        vii) Tools used as gauges should be kept a side when not in used so that their surfaces are not damaged in any way.<br>
                        viii) When soft metals are filed the file, tooth tend to become filled with lamped with metal. If the teeth are not cleared the filing operation will prove difficult. If the metal is not firmly wedged it may be removed using a file card.<br>
                        ix) Tightly wedged lumps of metal must be laboriously picked with the point of a scriber.<br>
                        x) File teeth are very brittle. Thus, files should never be mixed with other tools but kept separately.<br>
                        xi) When the thread on an electrical conduit is cut, the end should be filed to remove the left behind sharp surfaces as it could damage cable insulation when drawing them inside the conduits.<br>
                        xii) The quality of an electrician in most cases can be simple in appearance and tool kit. Its clothing should be neat and with no loose ends hanging around. There should be sufficient,</p>

                        <p>2. (oct/nov-2014) - Explain the application of each of the following tools when used in electrical installation practice: -<br>
                        i) Long nose pliers</p>
                        <p>Used to grip small objects, reach awkward places, holding wires, bend loops and attach wires.<br>
                        ii) Side cutter</p>
                        <p>Used to cut wire and the leads (or legs) of components in electronics. They can also be used to strip the insulation from wire.<br>
                        iii) Ball-pein hammer</p>
                        <p>Peen hammers are used to shape, move, or stretch metal. The peening face is useful for rounding off edges of metal pins and fasteners, such as rivets.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_09_30ca02035d0b715ff917g-20-1.jpg" alt="Image illustrating various hammer types" class="content-image">
                        <p>The common ball peen hammer has two heads, one flat and the other, called the peen, rounded. It is distinguished from a cross-peen hammer, diagonal-peen hammer, point-peen hammer, or chisel-peen hammer. Peening is normally a cold work process, but peening may also be performed after welding to help relieve the stresses that develop on cooling in the welded metal.</p>
