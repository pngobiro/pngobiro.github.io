                        <h3 id="topic-10-single-stroke-bell-heading" class="subsection-heading">Single stroke bell</h3>
                        <p>The bell is made up of two coils, usually wound up with varnish-insulated or cotton insulated copper wire wound on an insulated bobbin. The bobbins are fitted on to a U-Shaped soft iron core and the magnetic circuit is completed by a soft-iron strip riveted to spring loaded armature. The armature carries the striker which hits the gong at the end of its movement.</p>

                        <h4 id="topic-10-single-stroke-bell-operation-heading" class="subsubsection-heading">Operation</h4>
                        <p>- Current passes through the coil when the push-button or switch is operated.<br>
                        - The soft iron strip on the armature is drawn to the electromagnet against the pressure of a flat spring.<br>
                        - The armature carries a striker which hits the gong.<br>
                        - When the circuit is broken the coil becomes demagnetized and the spring pulls the armature back into its original position.<br>
                        - The striker will only operate when the push is operated.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Chimer</dfn>: the double note chimer is a variation of the single-stroke bell. Tubular chimes replace the gong and the second chime is struck by the re-bound of the striker.</p>

                        <h3 id="topic-10-trembler-bell-heading" class="subsection-heading">Trembler Bell</h3>
                        <p>The construction is similar to that of single stroke bell, with the exception of a set of variable contacts at armature which are used to break the circuit when the armature is drawn towards the electromagnet. The contact points are made of German silver to minimize the effect of the<br>
                        continual arcing during the operation. See the figure above.</p>
                        <h4 id="topic-10-trembler-bell-operation-heading" class="subsubsection-heading">Operation</h4>
                        <p>- When the push-button switch is operated, the coils form an electromagnet and attract the iron- soft strip.<br>
                        - The movement of armature to the coil opens the contacts.<br>
                        - The coil is then demagnetized and the spring pulls the armature back to its original position.<br>
                        - The cycle is then repeated, giving a continual make and break action.</p>
                        <p>The speed of the stroke can be varied by varying the contact screw. The <dfn>buzzer</dfn> is similar in construction to that of trembler bell, the only difference being the striker and the gong.</p>

                        <h3 id="topic-10-continuous-ringing-bell-heading" class="subsection-heading">Continuous ringing bell</h3>
                        <p>This bell differs from trembler bell in that a small lever is placed below the contact screw. When the current first flows through the coils the armature is attracted and so releases the catch allowing the contact arm to move under the influence of the auxiliary spring (lever). This (short-circuits) loses the contract thus completing the bell circuit independently of the bell-push and so the bell continues to ring even though the bell push may be released. The bell will continue to ring until the reset cord is pulled</p>

                        <p>- When the bell-push is operated the coil become an electromagnet and the armature is drawn towards them<br>
                        - The lever drops on the first stroke and shorts the push.<br>
                        - The bell now operates as a trembler bell.<br>
                        - To stop the bell, pull the cord thus resetting the lever.</p>

                        <h3 id="topic-10-polarized-bell-heading" class="subsection-heading">Polarized bell</h3>
                        <p>This bell operated by an alternating current such as may be obtained from the magnetos used in certain types of telephone circuit. When the current in the coils has one polarity, pole A of the magnet is strengthened and pole B weakened this causes the soft iron armature to pivot so that the striker rings bell 1 . When the current reverses, pole A is weakened and pole B , strengthened, so the armature moves back causing bell 2 to be struck. Thus, the bell produces two chimes for each cycle of alternating current.</p>

                        <p>1. <dfn>Bell Pushes and contacts</dfn>: the push button consists of two contacts, one fixed and one movable. The movable contact is either spring controlled or is itself in the form of a spring and is operated by press- knob or button. Bell contacts are used for a purpose as ringing a bell upon the opening of a door.<br>
                        2. <dfn>Bell transformers</dfn>: the electric bell will operate not only from direct current but also from alternating current. Bell circuits may be supplied using a bell transformer instead of a battery. Class A bell transformers provide a choice of three secondary voltages, 4,8 or 12 volts. Class B bell transformers provide a single secondary voltage of 6 volts. The voltage depends upon the type of bell employed and the length of wiring run in the bell circuit.</p>
                        <p>3. <dfn>Bell Relays</dfn>:<br>
                        > when a bell circuit is long, it may be possible that the voltage drop is great along the wires that the bell may not operate efficiently. In this case, additional cells may be added however, this is not the most efficient solution to the problem. In such conditions, a bell relay is suitable.<br>
                        > A relay is a pair of electrical contacts operated by an electromagnet. A very small current is sufficient to energize the electromagnet and attracts the spring-controlled armature. The movement of the armature causes the two contacts to close and operate the bell. The relay maybe energized separately from its own supply or it may use the bell supply.<br>
                        > In normally open (NO) relay type, the contacts remain open until the coil is energized while for normally closed (NC) type, the contacts remain closed as along as the coil is de-energized. Relays are used in industry to control heavy currents from a distance to reduce power loss in the cables. Examples include; control of circuit in power stations, car starter, alarm circuits e.t.c.</p>

                        <p>> A bell circuit is often arranged so that the bell may be operated from any one of a number of bell-pushes. An <dfn>indicator board</dfn> may be used to show which bell-push has been operated.<br>

                        <p>i) <dfn>Pendulum type indicator</dfn>: the element comprises a single-pole electromagnet with armature. The armature is pivoted to swing freely and colored flag is attached to the lower end. When the current flows through the coil, the armature is attracted. When current ceases the armature is released and the flag will then swing backwards and forwards for some time.<br>
                        ii) <dfn>Mechanical replacement indicator</dfn>: when the current flows through the coil the armature is attracted. This releases the catch and the flag drops. When the current ceases, the armature returns to its normal position owing to the action of the spring, but the flag remains down until it is raised by operating the replacement button.<br>
                        iii) <dfn>Electrical replacement type</dfn>: the element consists of two magnet coils, one of which is in series with the bell circuit. The second coil is connected in the replacement circuit. The armature is pivoted at its center about which it will rock. When current passes through the alarm circuit, one end of the armature is attracted, causing the flag to overbalance and fall to one side. To restore the flag, current is passed through the replacement coil which restores the flag to its original position.</p>

In normal use, current flows through the alarm contacts, contact B of the relay and relay coil thus remaining energized condition so that contact A is kept open while b is closed.

                        <p>1. Manual fire detection is the oldest method of detection. In the simplest form, a person yelling can provide fire warning. In buildings, however, a person's voice may not always transmit throughout the structure. For this reason, manual alarm stations are installed. The<br>
                        general design philosophy is to place stations within reach along paths of escape. It is for this reason that they can usually be found near exit doors in corridors and large rooms.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system. They are simple devices, and can be highly reliable when the building is occupied. The key disadvantage of manual stations is that they will not work when the building is unoccupied. They may also be used for malicious alarm activations. Nonetheless, they are an important component in any fire alarm system.<br>
                        > <dfn>Automatic detectors</dfn> operate at any time, day or night. A detector comprises a bimetallic strip which bends when heated to a predetermined temperature. A latch is released which allows a mercury switch to tilt and thus close the alarm circuit. The detectors are normally fixed to celling away from accidental or other damage at about 6 m intervals. They must be carefully sited away from direct sunlight, hot pipes or heating appliances.<br>
                        > Automatic detectors are meant to imitate one or more of the human senses of touch, smell or sight. Thermal detectors are similar to our ability to identify high temperatures, smoke detectors replicate the sense of smell, and flame detectors are electronic eyes. The properly selected and installed automatic detector can be a highly reliable fire sensor.<br>
                        2. <dfn>Thermal detectors</dfn> are the oldest type of automatic detection device, having origin in the mid 1800's, with several styles still in production today.<br>
                        > The most common units are fixed temperature devices that operate when the room reaches a predetermined temperature (usually in the $135^{\circ}-165^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ /$57^{\circ}-74^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$). The second most common type of thermal sensor is the rate-of-rise detector, which identifies an abnormally fast temperature climb over a short time period. Both of these units are "spot type" detectors, which means that they are periodically spaced along a ceiling or high on a wall.<br>
                        > The third detector type is the fixed temperature line type detector, which consists of two cables and an insulated sheathing that is designed to breakdown when exposed to heat.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of line type over spot detection is that thermal sensing density can be increased at lower cost.<br>
                        > Thermal detectors are highly reliable and have good resistance to operation from nonhostile sources. They are also very easy and inexpensive to maintain. On the down side, they do not function until room temperatures have reached a substantial temperature, at which point the fire is well underway and damage is growing exponentially.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, thermal detectors are usually not permitted in life safety applications. They are also not recommended in locations where there is a desire to identify a fire before substantial flames occur, such as spaces where high value thermal sensitive contents are housed.<br>
                        3. <dfn>Smoke detectors</dfn> are a much newer technology, having gained wide usage during the 1970's and 1980's in residential and life safety applications. As the name implies, these devices are designed to identify a fire while in its smoldering or early flame stages, replicating the human sense of smell.<br>
                        > The most common smoke detectors are spot type units, that are placed along ceilings or high on walls in a manner similar to spot thermal units. They operate on either an ionization or photoelectric principle, with each type having advantages in different applications. For large open spaces such as galleries and atria, a frequently used smoke detector is a projected beam unit.<br>
                        > This detector consists of two components, a light transmitter and a receiver, that are mounted at some distance (up to $300\mathrm{ft}$ /$100\mathrm{~m}$) apart. As smoke migrates between the two components, the transmitted light beam becomes obstructed and the receiver is no longer able to see the full beam intensity. This is interpreted as a smoke condition, and the alarm activation signal is transmitted to the fire alarm panel.<br>
                        > A third type of smoke detector, which has become widely used in extremely sensitive applications, is the air aspirating system. This device consists of two main components: a control unit that houses the detection chamber, an aspiration fan and operation circuitry; and a network of sampling tubes or pipes. Along the pipes are a series of ports that are designed to permit air to enter the tubes and be transported to the detector.<br>
                        > Under normal conditions, the detector constantly draws an air sample into the detection chamber, via the pipe network. The sample is analyzed for the existence of smoke, and then returned to atmosphere.<br>
                        > If smoke becomes present in the sample, it is detected and an alarm signal is transmitted to the main fire alarm control panel. Air aspirating detectors are extremely sensitive and are typically the fastest responding automatic detection method. Many high technology organizations, such as telephone companies, have standardized on aspiration systems. In cultural properties they are used for areas such as collections storage vaults and highly valuable rooms. These are also frequently used in aesthetically sensitive applications since components are often easier to conceal, when compared to other detection methods.<br>
                        > The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient. As such, they provide added opportunity for emergency personnel to respond and control the developing fire before severe damage occurs.</p>
                        <p>> They are usually the preferred detection method in life safety and high content value applications. The disadvantage of smoke detectors is that they are usually more expensive to install, when compared to thermal sensors, and are more resistant to inadvertent alarms. However, when properly selected and designed, they can be highly reliable with a very low probability of false alarm.<br>
                        4. <dfn>Flame detectors</dfn> represent the third major type of automatic detection method, and imitate the human sense of sight. They are line of sight devices that operate on either an infrared, ultraviolet or combination principle. As radiant energy in the approximate 4,000 to 7,700 angstroms range occurs, as indicative of a flaming condition, their sensing equipment recognizes the fire signature and sends a signal to the fire alarm panel.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of flame detection is that it is extremely reliable in a hostile environment. They are usually used in high value energy and transportation applications where other detectors would be subject to spurious activation. Common uses include locomotive and aircraft maintenance facilities, refineries and fuel loading platforms, and mines.<br>
                        > A disadvantage is that they can be very expensive and labor intensive to maintain. Flame detectors must be looking directly at the fire source, unlike thermal and smoke<br>

                        <p><dfn>A proximity sensor</dfn> is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks for changes in the field or return signal.<br>
                        > The object being sensed is often referred to as the proximity sensor's target. Different proximity sensor targets demands different sensors. For example, a capacitive proximity sensor or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor always requires a metal target</p>
