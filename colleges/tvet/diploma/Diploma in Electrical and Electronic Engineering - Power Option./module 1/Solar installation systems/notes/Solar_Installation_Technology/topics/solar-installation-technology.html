                        <p>It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global.</p>

                        <p>About half the incoming solar energy reaches the Earth's surface. The Earth receives 174 petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately $30 \%$ is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Earth's land surface, oceans and atmosphere absorb solar radiation, and this raises their temperature. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle.</p>

                        <p>The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones.

By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemical energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.</p>

                        <p>In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.</p>
                        <p>Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt between 1912 and 1913. Shuman's plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45-52 kilowatt (60-70 H.P.) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy. In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying: "We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun".</p>

Solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends. However, all renewable energies, other than geothermal and tidal, derive their energy from the sun. Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight. Active solar techniques use photovoltaic panels, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.</p>

                        <p>Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany won the 2007 Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C. with this passive house designed specifically for the humid and hot subtropical climate. Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history. Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese, who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth. The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion, selective shading and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.</p>
                        <p>Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures are a result of increased absorption of the Solar light by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and plant trees.</p>

Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields.</p>

                        <p>While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm.</p>
                        <p>Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.</p>
                        <p>Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.</p>

                        <p>Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the Pathfinder (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocketpropelled aircraft at 29,524 metres ( $96,864 \mathrm{ft}$ ) in 2001 . The Zephyr, developed by BAE Systems, is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft, making a 54-hour flight in 2007, and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010.</p>
                        <p>A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.</p>

Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, day-lighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.</p>
                        <p>A solar chimney is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses. Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.</p>

A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas. The plant, which had solar collection area of $4,700 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, could produce up to $22,700 \mathrm{~L}$ per day and operated for 40 years. Individual still designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications.</p>

                        <p>Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.</p>

                        <p>The widespread use of fossil fuels has brought numerous benefits to industrialized societies. Large amounts of agricultural, domestic and industrial wastes generated in these countries as a result of development, have potentially detrimental effects both on the environment. The importance of protecting the environment and restoring environmental damage cannot be overemphasized.In recent years, environmental pollution has become a global problem. Internationalization of industrial and social activities has given rise to problems such as global warming, desertification, and acid deposition. These global problems are rooted in the materially-rich lifestyles which are supported by abundant and wasteful use of fossil fuels in industrialized countries. The recycling of materials, and thus minimizing the generation of waste, is a basic concept which must be implemented in order to meet the new demands of sustainable development in both industrialized and developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Mechanisms for implementing this concept and for establishing environmentally compatible technologies which support the future "recycling" world are required. Systems, which utilize energies produced from biomass are typical examples of energy recycling systems. Biotechnology is one of the future-oriented technologies, and one that will play a major role in the exploitation of biomass energy. All biomass (plant, animal and microbial), originates through $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ fixation by photosynthesis. Biomass utilization is consequently included in the global carbon cycle of the biosphere. Biomass energy in developing countries, originates from fuelwood, animal wastes, and agricultural residues, and is primarily utilized for activities which are essential to survival, such as cooking and obtaining water. Improvements in the living standards in these countries will result in the non-essential use of energy. Development of technologies that efficiently produce biomass, and convert it to more convenient forms of energy is therefore very important.</p>

Approximately two thirds of the net global photosynthetic productivity worldwide is of terrestrial origin, while the remainder is produced mainly by phytoplankton in the oceans which cover approximately $70 \%$ of the total surface area of the earth.

In Japan, large amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are released into the atmosphere from electric power plants and industry. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ generated by these large point sources could potentially be recovered with relative ease through the use of an established technology such as chemical absorption. The enormity of the amounts of potentially recoverable $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would however necessitate the development of technologies for sequestering or, more favorably, utilizing this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.</p>

The derivation of energy from algal biomass is an attractive concept in that unlike fossil fuels, algal biomass is rather uniformly distributed over much of the earth's surface, and its utilization would make no net contribution to increasing atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels. Although algal biomass is regarded as a low-grade energy source owing to its high moisture content, through biological processes, it may be converted to modem gaseous and liquid fuels such as hydrogen, methane, ethanol, and oils.</p>

Biological $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production has thus recently received renewed attention owing to urban air pollution and global warming concerns (2).

The total carbon content of all biomass growing on land is estimated to be $5.6 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~kg}$ and, as Figure 10 shows, about one-fifth of this mass is renewed each year. Figure 6 shows how modern plant biomass is distributed across the continents. Clearly, biological conversion of solar energy to a chemical form in combustible materials presents a potentially vast resource. Using biomass as a fuel need not add to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because its products, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water vapour, are exactly the same as those of natural aerobic decay. If plant photosynthesis is carefully managed to renew carbon consumed by using vegetable matter as an energy source, the natural balance of the carbon cycle can be sustained.

                        <p>Solar chemical refers to a number of possible processes that harness solar energy by absorbing sunlight in a chemical reaction. The idea is conceptually similar to photosynthesis in plants, which converts solar energy into the chemical bonds of glucose molecules, but without using living organisms, which is why it is also called artificial photosynthesis. A promising approach is to use focused sunlight to provide the energy needed to split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a metallic catalyst such as zinc. This is normally done in a two step process so that hydrogen and oxygen are not produced in the same chamber, which creates an explosion hazard. Another approach involves taking the hydrogen created in this process and combining it with carbon dioxide to create methane. The benefit of this approach is that there is an established infrastructure for transporting and burning methane for power generation, which is not true for hydrogen. The problem with this approach is that carbon dioxide must be produced to release the stored energy, so it does not truly give "clean" energy.</p>

The oblique sunbeam distributes its light energy over twice as much area. The insolation into a surface is largest when the surface directly faces the Sun. As the angle increases between the direction at a right angle to the surface and the direction of the rays of sunlight, the insolation is reduced in proportion to the cosine of the angle; see effect of sun angle on climate.</p>
                        <p>The angle between the ground and the sunbeam rather than between the vertical direction and the sunbeam, a sunbeam one mile ( 1.6 km ) wide falls on the ground from directly overhead, and another hits the ground at a $30^{\circ}$ angle to the horizontal. Trigonometry tells us that the sine of a $30^{\circ}$ angle is $1 / 2$, whereas the sine of a $90^{\circ}$ angle is 1 . Therefore, the sunbeam hitting the ground at a $30^{\circ}$ angle spreads the same amount of light over twice as much area. This 'projection effect' is the main reason why the polar regions are much colder than equatorial regions on Earth. On an annual average the poles receive less insolation than does the equator, because at the poles the Earth's surface are angled away from the Sun.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Direct insolation</dfn> is the solar irradiance measured at a given location on Earth with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun's rays, excluding diffuse insolation. Direct insolation is equal to the solar constant minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. While the solar constant varies with the Earth-Sun distance and solar cycles, the losses depend on the time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the Solar elevation angle), cloud cover, moisture content, and other impurities. Insolation is a fundamental abiotic factor affecting the metabolism of plants and the behavior of animals.</p>
                        <p>Over the course of a year the average solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere at any point in time is roughly 1366 W . The radiant power is distributed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, although most of the power is in the visible light portion of the spectrum. The Sun's rays are attenuated as they pass through the atmosphere, thus reducing the irradiance at the Earth's surface to approximately $1000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ for a surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays at sea level on a clear day.</p>
                        <p>The actual figure varies with the Sun angle at different times of year, according to the distance the sunlight travels through the air, and depending on the extent of atmospheric haze and cloud cover. Ignoring clouds, the daily average irradiance for the Earth is approximately $250 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ taking into account the lower radiation intensity in early morning and evening, and its nearabsence at night.</p>
                        <p>The insolation of the sun can also be expressed in <dfn>Suns</dfn>, where one Sun equals $1000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ at the point of arrival, with $\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^{2} /$ day expressed as hours $/$ day. When calculating the output of a photovoltaic panel, the angle of the sun relative to the panel needs to be taken into account as well as the insolation. One Sun is a unit of power flux, not a standard value for actual insolation.</p>

                        <p>Photovoltaic's is normally associated with images of rooftop mounted solar panels or a vast expanse of solar panel arrays spread out over a desert floor. This is probably because so much emphasis is placed on photovoltaics as an alternative way to generate electrical power. Solar cells not only generate little electrical power but also generate a lot of information of very great interest for the photovoltaic researchers or thin film analysists. Solar cells are the smallest photovoltaic devices ever fabricated that are used either as irradiance sensors or as samples for studying new photovoltaic materials and/ or processes including reaction mechanisms. Solar cells range in size from a few square millimeters up to 156 mm square and even more for the case of silicon wafers. A research prototype solar cell usually requires probing but lacks the encapsulation so important for protecting solar modules from the degrading atmospheric and weather effects. A research prototype solar cell therefore, can have a rather crude looking construction compared to the sleek panels on display at any solar energy convention or any home where it is installed. It may simply be a thin film of a photovoltaic material sandwiched between two glass microscope slides with a silver paint used as electrical contacts. On the other hand, a solar reference cell is simply a small area ( $2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) solar cell packaged in a metal housing under a glass window intended for use in-doors to set simulated sunlight levels.</p>
                        <p>The National ASTM standard E948 and international IEC standard 60904-1 both specifies a set of common test conditions and methods for measuring the electrical performance parameters of photovoltaic cells. The aptly named Standard Testing Conditions (<dfn>STC</dfn>) includes the following: (1). Temperature of the device under test (DUT) must be $25 \pm 1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; (2). Spectral distribution of the light must be AM1.5 $\pm 25 \%$ and (3) Irradiance measured at the plane of the solar cell must be 1 Sun $\pm 2 \%$.</p>
                        <p>The Sun is take as a unit of irradiance, one of which is equivalent to $1000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ or $100 \mathrm{~mW} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The amount of atmosphere through which sunlight passes to reach a given location on Earth is called Air Mass (AM) and it varies with that location's air pressure, elevation, latitude, date and time of day. In a given day, AM is minimum when the sun is at its zenith and largest near the horizons. The test condition 1 Sun of AM 1.5 represents the average situation for the United States but for some combinations of locations and dates 1 Sun of AM1.5 may not occur. Given an AM of 1.5, testing out-doors may proceed only under a clear sky i.e. when there are no clouds within an angle of $30^{\circ}$ around the sun.</p>
                        <p>When the measured photocurrent is plotted against the bias voltage, the result obtained is a characteristic "I-V curve" for the solar cell. Three of the five performance parameters, the short-circuit current $I_{s c}$, the open-circuit voltage $V_{oc}$, the maximum power point $P m$, are derived from mathematical fits to different portions of the I-V curve. The parameters $V_{oc}$ and $I_{sc}$ are the intercepts of least-square fitted lines. $P_{m}$ is the point at which the derivative with respect to voltage is zero for a fifth-order polynomial fit to power, the product of current and voltage. Fitting helps to reduce measurement noise and the Oriel I-V Test software automatically performs this fitting and analysis. The parameters, $I_{sc}$, $Vo_{c}$, and Pm are then used to calculate FF and PCE. $I_{sc}$ and $V_{oc}$ are the intercepts where the I-V curve crosses the current and voltage axes respectively, and the "knee" point at $(V_{m}, I_{m})$ is where the solar cell delivers maximum power $P_{m}$. The FF or fill factor is the ratio of the area determined by $P_{m}$ to the area determined by $V_{oc}$ and $I_{sc}$. Power Conversion Efficiency is calculated by the following formula:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$PCE=\frac{P_{m}}{E_{m} \text { Area }}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>where, $E_{m}$ is the measured irradiance at the working plane of the solar cell, and Area is the surface area of the cell. For the purposes of research and early stage solar cells the PCE is the parameter of interest but for solar cells intended to be used as irradiance sensors, then the short circuit current is what matters most.</p>

                        <p>The STC are expressed as ranges centered on the nominal conditions so that, the DUT temperature is allowed to be within $24-26^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and so that irradiance may actually be between 1.98-1.02 Sun. Test conditions may be in tolerance but it worth to note that the performance parameters derived from I-V data under those conditions will still be in error.

                        <p>Solar radiation represents the largest energy flow entering our terrestrial ecosystem. After reflection and absorption in the atmosphere, some $10^{5}$ TW hit the surface of Earth and undergo conversion to all forms of energy used by humans with the exception of nuclear, geothermal, and tidal energy. This resource is enormous and corresponds to almost 6,000 fold the current global consumption of primary energy (13.7 TW). Thus, solar energy has the potential of becoming a major component of a sustainable energy portfolio with constrained greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                        <p>Solar radiation is a renewable energy resource that has been used by humanity in all ages and for various uses. The discovery of photovoltaic effect by Becquerel in 1839 and the creation of the first photovoltaic cell in the early 1950s opened entirely new perspectives on the use of solar energy for the production of electricity. Since then, the evolution of solar technologies continues at an unprecedented rate. Nowadays, there exist an extremely large variety of solar technologies and photovoltaics have been gaining an increasing market share for the last 20 years. Nevertheless, global generation of solar electricity is still small compared to the potential of this resource. The current cost of solar technologies and their intermittent nature make them hardly competitive on an energy market still dominated by cheap fossil fuels. From a scientific and technological viewpoint, the great challenge is finding new solutions for solar energy systems to become less capital intensive and more efficient.</p>

                        <p>Solar radiation is an electromagnetic wave emitted by the Sun's surface that originates in the bulk of the Sun where fusion reactions convert hydrogen atoms into helium. Every second 3,891,026 Joules of nuclear energy is released by the Sun's core. This nuclear energy flux is rapidly converted into thermal energy and transported toward the surface of the star where it is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The power density emitted by the Sun is of the order of $64 \mathrm{MW} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ of which $\sim 1370 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ reaches the top surface of the Earth's atmosphere with no significant absorption in the space. The latter quantity or amount of power is called the <dfn>solar constant</dfn>. The spectral range of the solar radiation is very large and encompasses nanometric wavelengths of gamma- and $x$ - rays through metric wavelengths of radio waves. The energy flux is divided unevenly among the three large spectral categories. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation ( $\lambda<400 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) accounts for less than $9 \%$ of the total; visible light (VIS) $(400 \mathrm{~nm}<\lambda<700 \mathrm{~nm})$ for $39 \%$; and infrared (IR) for about $52 \%$.</p>

                        <p>The global solar energy potential ranges from 2.5 to 80 TW . The lowest estimate represents around $18 \%$ of the total current primary energy consumption (13.7 TW) and exceeds $10 \%$ of the estimated primary energy demand by 2030 (21.84 TW). More optimistic assumptions give a potential for solar energy exceeding 5 fold the current global energy consumption. Despite the relatively low power density of the solar flux, solar energy has the potential of supplying a nonnegligible fraction of our energy needs. In the case of the US for example, the total electricity demand ( 418 GW ) in 2002 could be satisfied by covering a land surface of 180 km square with photovoltaics.</p>
                        <p>Current electricity generation from PVs is only of the order of 2.6 GW compared to 36.3 GW for all renewable energies, hydroelectric power excluded. Developed countries are steadily increasing their investments in solar power plants, and IEA projections for 2030 give an enhancement of solar electricity generation up to 13.6 GW ( $80 \%$ of which will be from photovoltaics, and the rest (2.4 GW) from solar thermal plants). However, this amount will not exceed $6 \%$ of the total electricity production from non-hydro renewable energies. It is worth noting that passive solar technologies for water heating, not included in these statistics, represent a fairly large amount of power. IEA estimates a power production of 5.3 GW in 2002 and an increase up to 46 GW by 2030. The major causes of the slow deployment of solar technologies are: (i) The current relative high capital cost per kW installed compared with other fossil fuel based and renewable technologies; (ii) The intermittent nature of the energy input, and hence the requirement for energy storage systems to match the energy supply with the electricity demand and to decrease the capital cost.</p>

                        <p>Despite the notable progress made in the improvement of the efficiencies of all these technologies, achieved values are still far from the thermodynamic efficiency limits of $\sim 31 \%$ for single junctions, $50 \%$ for 3-cell stacks, impurity PVs, or up- and down converters, and 54 - 68 \% for hot carrier- or impact ionization-based devices. Furthermore, the efficiencies of commercial (or even the best prototype) modules are only about $50 \%$ to $65 \%$ of these "champion" cells. Closing these gaps is the subject of ongoing research. The solar-to-electric efficiency of solar thermal technologies varies largely depending upon the solar flux concentration factor, the temperature of the thermal intermediary and the efficiency of the thermal cycle for the production of mechanical work and electricity.</p>
                        <p>Parabolic troughs and power towers reach peak efficiencies of about 20 \%. Dish-Stirling systems are the most efficient with about $30 \%$ solar-to-electric demonstrated efficiency. The performance of these systems is highly influenced by the plant availability. In the case of parabolic troughs and power towers, thermal storage increases the annual capacity factor from typically 20 \% to 50 \% and $75 \%$, respectively.</p>

                        <p>Photovoltaic devices allow the direct production of electricity from light absorption. The active material in a photovoltaic system is a semiconductor capable of absorbing photons with energies equal to or greater than its band-gap. Upon photon absorption, an electron of the valence band is promoted to the conduction band and is free to move through the bulk of the semiconductor. In order for this free charge to be captured for current generation, decay to the lower energy state, i.e. recombination with the hole in the valence band, has to be prevented through charge separation. In photovoltaic devices made of inorganic semiconductors, charge separation is driven by the built-in electric field at the $p-n$ junction. As a consequence, their efficiency is determined by the ability of photo-generated minority carriers to reach the $p-n$ junction before recombining with the majority carriers in the bulk of the material. Thus, bulk properties such as crystallinity and chemical purity often control the device efficiency.</p>

                        <p>One of the most critical requirements for a single junction cell is that the band-gap energy must be optimized to transfer maximum energy from the incident light to the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The simultaneous optimization of the cell voltage proportional to band-gap, the photo-generated current density, decreases with band-gap and of the fill factor where optimal value of band-gap is in the range of $1.1-1.4 \mathrm{eV}$. The band-gap energy of silicon ( $1.12 \mathrm{eV}$ ) is almost ideal and allows absorption of photons in the near-infrared (NIR), visible, and ultraviolet spectrum. However, the indirect band-gap of crystalline silicon causes relatively poor light absorption ( less than $10^{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) for photons with energies below $3.4 \mathrm{eV}$, which is equivalent to the silicon direct band-gap energy. Typical sc-Si wafers must be $100-300 \mu \mathrm{m}$ thick for achieving efficient light absorption. Thin-film photovoltaic materials have a major advantage over silicon since most of them have direct band-gap resulting in higher optical absorption. This allows thin film PV devices to use very thin layers of active material (about $1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ ) that can thus be of lower quality.</p>
                        <p>Today's most successful materials for thin-film photovoltaics are $\alpha$-Si where the optical absorption is increased by impurity scattering, CdTe with a band-gap of $1.48 \mathrm{eV}$, and CIGS, whose band-gap can be tuned around the nominal value of $1.04 \mathrm{eV}$ by controlling its composition and that has the highest absorption constant ( $3-6 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) reported for any semiconductor. More effort is required to find new semiconductor materials combining optimal band-gap, inactive grain boundaries, stability properties, and ease in processing. Spectrum splitting through multijunction cells with band-gap energies designed to match the solar spectrum is a very effective route to achieve increased efficiency since this method reduces the energy loss driven by the thermalization of hot electrons generated by the absorption of photons with energy greater than the band-gap.</p>

Consequently, good material with high chemical purity and structural perfection is required to fight recombination. The surfaces used must be effectively passivated to reduce recombination and impurities and imperfections in the bulk state must be avoided as they can absorb extra energy of the conduction-band electrons and convert it into heat energy. Bulk recombination is caused by lattice imperfections derived from doping the bulk Si (e.g. with phosphorus and boron). Main recombination mechanisms are the Shockley-Read recombination which is the electron-hole recombination through imperfections giving up the recombination energy as photons or phonons and the Auger recombination in which the recombination energy is given up to another free carrier.</p>

Crystalline silicon technologies have a potential for further incremental improvement in performance and cost reduction. The most successful c-Si cell designs of the last 15 years with efficiencies above $20 \%$ are the photolithographically-based Passivated Emitter Solar Cell (PESC), the Back PointContact (BCP) cell of 22.3 \% efficiency) and the Passivated Emitter Rear Locally-Diffused (PERL) of 24.7 \%.</p>

                        <p>There are a number of options available at different stages of development. The most developed technologies are the parabolic dish, the parabolic trough, and the power tower. The parabolic dish is already commercially available. This system is modular and can be used in single dish applications with output power of the order of 25 kWe or grouped in dish farms to create large multi-megawatt plants. Parabolic troughs are already a proven technology and will most likely be used for deployment of solar energy in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Various large plants are currently in operation like in California with 354 MW output or in the planning process in the USA and in Europe. Power towers with low cost and efficient thermal storage promise to offer dispatchable high capacity factor power plants in the future.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Parabolic trough systems use single-axis tracking parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight on thermally efficient receiver tubes that contain a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The receiver tubes are usually metallic and embedded into an evacuated glass tube that reduces heat losses. A special high-temperature coating reduces radiation heat losses and the working fluid (e.g. thermo-oil) is heated above $400 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pumped through a series of heat exchangers to produce superheated steam which powers a conventional turbine generator to produce electricity. It is also possible to produce superheated steam directly using solar collectors. This makes the thermo-oil unnecessary and also reduces costs because the relatively expensive thermo-oil and the heat exchangers are no longer needed. However, direct steam generation (DSG) is still in the prototype stage and more research is required to solve the thermo-mechanical issues related to working pressures above 100 bar and the presence of a two-phase fluid in the receivers.</p>
                        <p>The efficiency of a solar thermal power plant is the product of the collector efficiency, field efficiency and steam-cycle efficiency. The collector efficiency depends on the angle of incidence of the sunlight and the temperature in the absorber tube and can reach values up to 75 \%. Field losses are usually below $10 \%$. Altogether, solar thermal trough power plants can reach annual efficiencies of about 15 \%; the steam-cycle efficiency of about $35 \%$ and has the most significant influence. Central receiver systems such as solar thermal tower plants can reach higher temperatures and therefore achieve higher efficiencies. Current research in parabolic trough systems aims at improving performance, lifetime, reducing manufacturing, operation and maintenance costs as well as improved designs. These activities concern all critical components of the system namely the support and tracking structure, the reflector which could be glass mirrors, polymeric reflectors and other alternative reflectors, and the receiver tubes (absorbers, glass/metal seals, etc). A more fundamental research field concerns the development of new heat transfer fluids with good stability properties at higher temperatures and compatible with thermal storage systems discussed.</p>
                        <p>In the case of DSG plants, a phase- change thermal storage may be better adapted than current thermal storage concepts. A technical assessment of parabolic troughs and power towers by NREL including forecasts for cost and performance can be found in reference.</p>

                    <h3 id="power-towers-conversion-heading" class="subsection-heading">Power towers</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In a power tower plant, hundreds of two-axis tracking heliostats are installed around a tower where they focus sunlight with concentrations ranging from 100 to 10,000 suns. The absorber is located on the top of the tower and can reach temperatures from $200 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $3000 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Hot air or molten salt are usually used to transport the heat from the absorber to a steam generator where superheated steam is produced to drive a turbine and an electrical generator. Power towers are suited for large-output applications, in the 30 to 400 MWe range and need to be large to be economical.</p>
                        <p>Thermal storage can be easily integrated with this type of solar systems allowing the enhancement of the annual capacity factor from $25 \%$ to $65 \%$ and the stabilization of the power output through fluctuations in solar intensity until the stored energy is depleted. Since early 1980s, power towers were built in Russia, Italy, Spain, Japan, France, and the USA, with power outputs ranging from 0.5 MWe to 10 MWe (like the Solar Two in Southern California) and using various combinations of heat transfer fluids (steam, air, liquid sodium, molten nitrate, molten nitrate salt) and storage media (water/steam, nitrate salt/water, sodium, oil/rock, ceramic).</p>
                        <p>The Solar Two plant has proven the feasibility of molten-salt power towers, achieving turbine operation at full capacity for three hours after sunset thanks to the two-tank ( $290 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}/570 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) molten salt storage system (with a capacity of 110 MWh ). The main design challenge for this system was identifying the materials that work with molten salt, since this fluid has relatively high freezing point ( $\sim 220^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), low viscosity, wets metal surfaces extremely well, and is corrosive. Solar Tres (Spain, 2002) is the first commercial power tower and is a follow-up of the technologies developed for Solar Two. Its size is three fold larger, the electrical power output is 15 MWe, and the thermal storage capacity 600 MWh (16 hours).</p>
                        <p>The efficiency of a solar-powered steam turbine electric generator used in the power tower concept is a critical function of the temperature TR of the receiver, which is influenced not only by the incident energy but also of several factors including the heliostat optical performance, the mirror cleanliness, accuracy of the tracking system and wind effects. For an ambient temperature of 340 K , the efficiency is $35 \%$ for TR = 800 K and 62 \% for TR = 3000 K . Solar Two achieved 13 \% peak efficiency with TR = $570 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The development of heat transfer fluids working at high temperature is a key issue for increasing the overall efficiency of power towers.</p>
                        <p>Alternative systems for converting thermal energy into electricity have been explored, such as liquid metal magnetohydrodynamic generators (LMMHD). These systems were first investigated in the early 1980s and offer significant increases in the system thermal efficiency over the $33 \%$ considered attainable with conventional turbo-machinery with sodium at a temperature of $650 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the theoretical efficiency is $39.5 \%$. A peak efficiency of $46.5 \%$ is predicted for lithium at $760^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The thermodynamic efficiency at maximum power with an ambient temperature of 300 K and a black-body source temperature of 6000 K is $64 \%$ and occurs at a receiver optimal temperature of 2900 K . Other potential advantages are that the sodium/steam heat exchanger is eliminated in liquid metal systems and where LMMHD systems employ the same working fluid as the solar receiver, no re-circulating pump is required as pumping power is provided directly by the cycle.</p>
                        <p>The development of new heat transfer fluids (HTFs) is crucial for increasing the operating temperature of a solar thermal plant and hence the efficiency of the steam cycle. Stability at high temperature, low flammability, low vapor pressure at high temperature, low corrosivity in standard materials, low freezing point, high boiling point, and low cost are the main required characteristics. Various thermal storage options are currently being considered for parabolic troughs and power towers. Some of them have already been demonstrated but many need further research, particularly concerning the optimization of the HTF materials.</p>

If the solar collector field cannot produce enough heat to drive the turbine, the molten salt is pumped back from the hot to the cold tank and heats up the heat transfer fluid. The molten salt as it was used in the Solar-Two solar tower pilot demonstration plant is a binary mixture of $60 \%$ sodium nitrate ($\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$) and $40 \%$ potassium nitrate ($\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$) salt. The feasibility of this system was proven and the concept seems to have low technological risk despite the relatively high freezing point ( $\sim 225^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) of the salt.</span>

                        <p>Dish-engine systems can be used to generate electricity in the kilowatts range. A parabolic concave mirror concentrates sunlight where the two-axis tracked mirror must follow the sun with a high degree of accuracy in order to achieve high efficiencies. At the focus is a receiver which is heated up over $700 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The absorbed heat drives a thermal engine which converts the heat into motive energy and drives a generator to produce electricity. If sufficient sunlight is not available, combustion heat from either fossil fuels or biofuels can also drive the engine and generate electricity. The solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of dish-engine systems can be as high as $30 \%$ with large potential for low cost deployment. For the moment, the electricity generation costs of these systems are much higher than those for trough or tower power plants and only series production can achieve further significant cost reductions for dish-engine systems.</p>
                        <p>A number of prototype dish-engine systems are currently operating in Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Spain. High levels of performance have been established; durability remains to be proven although some systems have operated for more than 10,000 hours. Most research and development efforts aim at incrementally enhancing the reliability, performance, and costeffectiveness of all major components of these systems like the concentrators, receivers, and engines. The development of high-efficiency low-cost thermal engines or alternative heat-toelectric conversion systems is the most critical requirement for these systems to become economical. Various thermodynamic cycles have been considered for dish-engine systems. Stirling and open Brayton (gas turbine) cycles have shown the best performances to date. Modern high-performance Stirling engines use hydrogen or helium working gas at temperatures over $700 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pressures as high as 20 MPa , resulting in thermal-to-electric conversion efficiencies of about $40 \%$.</p>
                        <p>The main disadvantage of these types of engines is their manufacturing cost mainly determined by the materials used for the hot part heat exchanger which usually requires stainless steel, hightemperature alloys or ceramic materials and by the design of the cooling system. In a dishBrayton system, solar heat is used to replace or supplement the fuel at the entrance of the gas turbine. Current designs include pressure ratios of of about 2.5, turbine inlet temperatures of about $850 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and recuperation of waste heat with predicted efficiencies over $30 \%$. DishBrayton systems are still at an early stage of development. Alternative dish systems replace the thermal engine with high-efficiency above $30 \%$ in multijunction photovoltaic cells working with concentrated sunlight or with thermoelectric or thermionic devices for direct current extraction from the high temperature receiver. Thermoelectrics can convert thermal energy into electrical energy through the Seeback effect.</p>
                        <p>The development of nano-technologies led to realization of devices with inter-electrode spacing as small as 1-10 nm, allowing tunneling of hot electrons and thus higher conversion efficiencies. As in the case of thermoelectric devices, extensive research efforts are now focused on low temperature applications such as cooling at temperatures below room temperature or power generation from waste-heat at temperatures of the range of 400-500 K. For high temperature applications, effective high-energy electron selectivity, and decreasing the large (up to 50 %) power losses caused by the charge-space effect are among the main fundamental issues that are currently being addressed to enhance the efficiency of thermionics.</p>

                        <p>In contrast with the previously described thermal technologies, solar chimneys convert into electricity not only direct normal irradiance but global irradiance. A solar chimney power plant has a high chimney up to 1000 m and is surrounded by a large collector roof up to 130 m in diameter that consists of glass or resistive plastic supported on a framework. Towards its centre, the roof curves upwards to join the chimney creating a funnel. The sun heats up the ground and the air underneath the collector roof and the heated air follow the roof until it reaches the chimney. There, it flows at high speed ( 35 mph ) through the chimney and drives multiple wind turbines at its bottom. The ground under the collector roof behaves as a storage medium and can even heat up the air for a significant time after sunset. The efficiency of the solar chimney power plant is below $2 \%$ and depends mainly on the height of the tower. However, the whole power plant is not without other uses as the outer area under the collector roof can also be utilized as a greenhouse for agricultural purposes.

                        <p>Concentration of solar light in solar thermal plants reaches 5,000 suns and produces temperatures of several hundred degrees. Therefore, it can be used for some specific thermal or thermochemical processes where high-temperature is required. The spectrum of applications is wide and includes: Hybrid solar/fossil processes such as (a) carbo-thermic reduction of metal oxides using coke or natural gas as chemical reducing agent. The deployment of such processes could substantially reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in industrial applications (up to 59% of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-equivalent emission reductions for zinc production); (b) solar thermal decomposition, or "pyrolysis" of fossil fuels or biomass, solar steam reforming of natural gas (950-1200 K with efficiency ranging from 65-75 %, or solar steam gasification of heavy hydrocarbons or coal ( $1350-1600 \mathrm{~K}$ ).</p>

Hydrogen production through thermochemical cycles were proposed to bypass the $\mathrm{H}_{2}/\mathrm{O}_{2}$ separation problem of direct water dissociation since hydrogen and oxygen are produced at different steps. Two-step systems with theoretical efficiencies above $30 \%$ are based on metal oxide redox reactions: (1) solar reduction of the metal oxide at elevated temperatures either in thermal or carbon thermal, where C or $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ are reducing agents; (2) exothermic oxidation of the metal below 800 K . To time of writing this book, the highest potential cycles in this category are the $\mathrm{ZnO}/\mathrm{Zn}$ cycle with theoretical efficiencies of about 50 \% at 2300 K , and $\mathrm{Fe}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{4}/\mathrm{FeO}$ cycle with theoretical efficiencies of about 60 \% at 1900 K had been recorded. In both cases, separation of the product gases from the intermediate chemical agents is limiting the yield of the latter and the overall energy efficiency.</p>

                        <p>Artificial lighting accounts for the largest component of electricity use in commercial U.S. buildings and security systems. Hybrid solar lighting provides an exciting new means of reducing energy consumption while also delivering significant benefits associated with natural lighting in commercial buildings. It contributes to meeting the requirements set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for renewable energy consumption by the federal government in the USA to be not less than 3 \% in FY 2007 - 2009, 5 \% in FY 2010 - 2012, and 7.5 \% in 2013 and thereafter. The hybrid lighting technology was originally developed for fluorescent lighting applications but recently has been enhanced to work with incandescent accent-lighting sources, such as the parabolic aluminized reflector (PAR) lamps commonly used in retail spaces. Commercial building owners use the low-efficiency PAR lamps because of their desirable optical properties and positive impact on sales. Yet the use of this inefficient lighting results in some retailers' spending 55-70 % of their energy budgets on lighting and lighting-related energy costs.</p>
                        <p>Hybrid lighting has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption while also maintaining or exceeding lighting quality requirements. Implementation of the hybrid solar lighting technology across the United States would represent significant energy savings to the country and would provide building managers with a near-term, energy-efficient, higher quality, economically viable alternative to incandescent lamps. Artificial lighting accounts for almost a quarter of the energy consumed in commercial buildings and 10-20 % of energy consumed by industry. Solar lighting can significantly reduce artificial lighting requirements and energy costs in many commercial and industrial buildings and in institutional facilities such as schools, libraries, and hospitals. Future R&D is aimed at enhancing the performance and reliability of the technology as well as extending the application of the system to work with newly emerging solid-state lighting sources. The hybrid solar lighting technology delivers the benefits of natural lighting with the advantages of an electric lighting system which include flexibility, convenience, reliability, and control and these overcomes the constraints that marginalized the use of day lighting in the $20^{\text {th }}$ century.</p>

                        <p>The hybrid solar lighting system uses a roof-mounted solar collector to concentrate visible sunlight into a bundle of plastic optical fibers. The optical fibers penetrate the roof and distribute the sunlight to multiple "hybrid" luminaires within the building. The hybrid luminaires blend the natural light with artificial light to maintain a constant level of room lighting. One collector powers about eight fluorescent hybrid light fixtures which can illuminate about 1000 square feet. When sunlight is plentiful, the fiber optics in the luminaires provides all or most of the light needed in an area. During times of little or no sunlight, a sensor controls the intensity of the artificial lamps to maintain a desired illumination level.</p>
                        <p>Unlike conventional electric lamps, the natural light produces little to no waste heat having an efficacy of 200 lumens/ Watt (l/W) and is cool to the touch. This is because the system's solar collector removes the infrared (IR) light from the sunlight: the part of the spectrum that generates much of the heat in conventional bulbs. Because the optical fibers lose light as their length increases, it makes sense right now to use hybrid solar lighting in top-story or single-story spaces. The current optimal optical fiber length is 50 feet or less. The hybrid solar lighting technology can separate and use different portions of sunlight for various applications. Thus, visible light can be used directly for lighting applications while IR light can be used to produce electricity or generate heat for hot water or space heating. The optimal use of these wavelengths is the focus of continued studies and development efforts.</p>

                        <p>Electric lighting is the greatest consumer of electricity in commercial buildings and the generation of this electricity by conventional power plants is the building sector's most significant cause of air pollution. Hybrid lighting can help conserve electricity in proportion to the amount of sunlight available. Hybrid solar lighting technology could benefit federal buildings particularly in the Sunbelt where cooling is a significant source of energy use. Full-spectrum solar energy systems provide a new and realistic opportunity for wide-ranging energy, environmental and economic benefits. Because hybrid solar lighting has no infrared component, it can be considered as a high-efficiency light source. Other advantages include;</p>

Hybrid solar lighting can be used both for direct ambient lighting and for indirect lighting, task lighting, and accent lighting. In retrofit applications, hybrid solar lighting is easily incorporated into existing building designs, and the optical fibers can be rerouted to different locations as lighting needs change. By intentionally misaligning the solar collector from the sun, occupants can even dim or curtail distributed sunlight.</span>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The concept of hybrid lighting has existed since the early 1970s but it has been difficult to make the technology practical. Japanese researchers had earlier developed solar collectors with glass optical fibers which are more heat-resistant but also more expensive and harder to work with. The glass-based system costs about $40,000 to illuminate 1000 square feet. Through the use of plastic optical fibers and components ORNL has been able to cut the system cost significantly moving closer to a target of $3,000 for a system that illuminates 1000 square feet. When that target price is reached, a building owner in Hawaii could pay for implementing the new technology in just 2-3 years with the savings on electricity bills alone. In other parts of the country where sunlight is less abundant and utility costs are lower, this payback would obviously take longer.</p>
                        <p>The payback period for hybrid solar lighting lengthens in proportion to the efficiency of the electric lamps used in combination with distributed sunlight. Because linear fluorescent lamps are very efficient (65-90 lm/W), the models indicate that a hybrid configuration used with such lamps will require more than 10 years to pay for itself in most regions of the country during the early years of commercialization. As prices fall, hybrid solar lighting has the potential to become cost-competitive in most in-door lighting scenarios. A hybrid configuration is likely to extend the typical life of incandescent and/or halogen lamps. When incandescent lamps are dimmed, filament temperatures decrease and as filament temperatures decrease, life expectancy increases. Although the lamps will last longer, a penalty in efficiency occurs because cooler filaments are generally less efficient at radiating visible light.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In solar technology, the controller compares the actual direction it is pointing to the actual computed position of the sun and then determines if the collector needs to be moved to match its position with that of the sun (tracking system). The motors then move at a speed proportional to the difference in the actual and computed positions. This process is performed continuously throughout the day in order to track the sun accurately. The control board operates on a 12 V or 24 V dc supply and uses less than 2 Watts or a photovoltaic solar cell can also be used to power the board. The development of a re-designed and less expensive tracking mechanism for the solar collector was also begun in FY 2005. Among suggested design modifications from an initial "manufacturability" analysis was the use of a high-precision linear actuator in combination with a gear-train drive to reduce cost while still providing high tracking accuracy.</p>
                        <p>Prototypes are already proving that the hybrid solar lighting concept is viable both technically and economically. The latest prototype provides lighting practitioners with unprecedented design flexibility and control over where and how sunlight is used inside buildings. This prototype uses a bundle of 127 small optical fibers, each of which can distribute 350 lumens to several different hybrid luminaires on a sunny day making possible numerous day lighting applications. For example, some hybrid luminaires being developed allow hybrid solar lighting to be used with linear and compact florescent lamps and with incandescent/halogen lamps.</p>

The density of power radiated from the sun (referred to as solar energy constant) is $1.373 \mathrm{~kW} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Solar energy is available in abundance in most parts of the world. A Solar cell is a device which converts photons present in Solar rays to direct-current (DC) and voltage (V). This associated technology is called Solar/ Photovoltaic (SPV) technology.</p>
                        <p>A typical silicon PV cell is a thin wafer consisting of a very thin layer of phosphorous-doped ( N type) silicon on top of a thicker layer of boron-doped (P-type) silicon. In this set up, an electrical field is created near the top surface of the cell where these two materials are in contact and form a P-N junction. When sunlight hits the semiconductor surface, an electron springs up and is attracted towards the N-type semiconductor material. This causes more negative (electrons) in the n-type and more positive (holes) in the P-type semiconductors, generating a higher flow of electricity. This is known as <dfn>Photovoltaic effect</dfn>. The amount of current generated by a PV cell depends on its efficiency, its size or surface area and the intensity of sunlight striking these surfaces (Figure 7.1). For example, under peak sunlight conditions a typical commercial PV cell with a surface area of about 25 square inches will produce about 2 watts peak power.</p>

The TMY consists of a selection of each of the twelve months so that it best represents the average of that particular month over past years. The TMY is therefore a composite year with representative months selected from different years from the past data available. For Example, consider a representative month as January. Every January month of past years is compared with the average data of all the past years (January month) and the one closest to the average is considered. The selection is weighted $50 \%$ on solar radiation and $25 \%$ each on ambient temperature and wind speed. TMY data is useful for photovoltaic system, design and analysis.</p>

                        <p>In Thin Film Solar technology, a very thin layer of a chosen semiconductor material that has a range of some nanometer level to several micrometers in thickness is deposited onto either coated glass or stainless steel or a polymer substrate to produce a thin film coat. Various thinfilm technologies are being developed to reduce the amount of light-absorbing materials required to construct the solar cell. This has resulted in reduction of processing costs and energy content. However, conversion efficiencies are also lower in these cases by an average of 7-10 %. Their modules produced are of lesser efficiency at the same level of energy requirement and as a consequence, longer collector areas are required and consequently too more requirement of land to install them. This technology is therefore apt where non productive land is available for example deserts of Rajasthan or Sahara desert. They have become popular compared to wafer silicon due to their lower costs, flexibility, lighter weights and ease of integration. Figure 7.8</p>

The solar cells made from these materials tend to have lower energy conversion efficiency than bulk silicon but are also less expensive to produce.

Compared to other thin-film materials, CdTe is easier to deposit and more suitable for large-scale production. CdTe technology has been significantly been refined over the past few years. It is uniquely capable of producing highvolume, low-cost modules, making widespread and affordable solar electricity a reality. The physical characteristics of CdTe are such that it is almost perfectly matched to the solar spectrum. This allows CdTe modules to absorb more of the available solar energy in low and diffuse light situations such as dawn and dusk or under cloudy skies and convert it into electricity more efficiently than conventional cells. As a result, CdTe thin film modules will generally produce more electricity under real world conditions than conventional solar modules with similar power ratings.</p>

                        <p>Concentrating Solar Thermal technologies (CSP) is used to produce heat or electricity where their systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A concentrating collector system can have a stationary collector or tracking one to track the sun. In stationary systems, the reflector and absorber are in fixed positions usually oriented directly to true south. Tracking devices shift the position of the reflector and the receiver to maximize the amount of sunlight concentrated on to the receiver. Tracking collectors are either single-axis or double-axis. Single-axis tracking devices move the collector on one axis East to West or North to South while Dual-axis tracking devices track the sun on all axes. The entire collector, containing the reflector and receiver, generally moves as a unit in both types.</p>

Each concentration method is capable of producing high temperature and with correspondingly high thermodynamic efficiencies but they vary in the way in which they track the sun and focuses light.

                        <p>Stand-alone solar power plant for the power generation comprises of Solar PV module array, Module mounting structures, Charge controller, Battery bank, Inverter and Load circuitry. Power supply in most of the cities and towns is unreliable which has forced some people to use small generators and accumulators. These generators are operated with fossil fuels like kerosene, petrol and diesel which in turn cause air, water and soil pollution. It also leads to an increase in dependence on oil imports but a solar power plant is a good cheaper and clean option for electrification in areas that are located away from the grid line or where other sources are neither available nor can be harnessed in a techno-economically viable manner.</p>
                        <p>A solar power plant of the size 10-100 kW (kilowatt) depending on the load demand is preferable particularly with a liberal subsidy and low-interest soft loan from financial institutions. The idea is to raise the quality of life of the people subjected to poverty in such areas. This coupled with low-gestation remote areas of many states that need electrification. A typical stand-alone Solar PV power plant is shown in the figure 7.15 with a control panel (inset of photograph) with all the peripheral components housed.</p>

                        <p>Solar water heating system generally comprise of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to absorb the heat from the collector toughened glass shield, insulated storage tank, cold water supply tank and insulated piping. In a Solar water heating system water is heated by the use of solar energy. These systems use solar energy to heat either water or a heat-transfer fluid, such as a water-glycol antifreeze mixture in collectors generally mounted on a roof. The sun rays penetrate through the glass and fall on the absorber. The heat of the sunrays is absorbed by the cold water inside the absorber thereby increasing its temperature. The storage is either through the thermosyphon or the forced flow system. In the Thermosyphon system, up to 3000 liters per day can be installed however, for higher capacities it is necessary to use forced flow system. The water temperature can be raised up to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The solar water heating system can be used for bathing, washing, boiler feed water pre-heating and other similar purposes. The investment made can be recovered in 4 to 6 year time and the life of the system is around 10-15 years if maintained properly since operation and maintenance cost are negligible.</p>

                        <p>Solar radiation is the main fuel resource for solar energy systems. The availability of solar radiation directly determines the revenue of solar energy power plants all over the world. Knowledge of this resource is therefore crucial to determine the economically viability of any country. Direct normal irradiance is the amount of solar radiation received directly from the sun ignoring radiation from the rest of the sky falling onto a plane perpendicular to the direction of the sun. It can be converted and used for electricity generation via concentrating solar thermal power plants or concentrated PV. Direct irradiance has the advantage that it can be concentrated directly with mirrors to reach high temperature or high radiative flux. However, the disadvantage is that it is only available in cloud-free situations or areas. Therefore, energy systems that use direct irradiance are only possible in sunny regions where cloud-free conditions are prevalent. These regions are mostly along the tropical countries.</p>

                        <h3 id="solar-radiation-design-factor" class="subsection-heading">i. Solar Radiation</h3>
                        <p>Solar Energy is a perennial and pervasive source of energy. Solar electricity is ideal for remote electrification in the current context and therefore Stand-alone SPV power plants are the ideal choice for rural remote villages where conventional grid extension is not viable either due to inhospitable terrain or due to poor density of load. Solar technologies using concentrating systems for electrical production require sufficient direct beam radiation which is the beam radiation from the sun that passes through the planet's atmosphere without deviation and refraction. Consequently, appropriate site locations are normally situated in arid to semi-arid regions where there is intense sunlight most of the time. Acceptable production costs of solar electricity occur where radiation levels exceed about $1700 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ year.</p>
                        <h3 id="atmospheric-effect-solar-radiation-design" class="subsection-heading">ii. Atmospheric effect on Solar Radiation</h3>
                        <p>Air mass is the optical path length through the earth's atmosphere for light from a celestial source travel. As it passes through the atmosphere, light is attenuated by scattering and absorption and the more atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation. Celestial bodies on the horizon appear less bright than when they are at the zenith. The attenuation, known as atmospheric extinction is described quantitatively by the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law. It has been reported that for clear sky conditions, the fractions of direct solar radiation which is depleted due to various reasons are: Atmospheric scattering 9 %, Surface reflection 6 %. Other gases, smoke, dust etc. 3 %</p>
                        <h3 id="air-mass-design-factor" class="subsection-heading">iii. Air Mass</h3>
                        <p>Air mass normally indicated in practical use is the relative air mass i.e. the path length relative to that at the zenith at sea level. By definition then, the sea-level air mass at the zenith is one. Air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon (figure 8.1). Air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level. However, most closed-form expressions for air mass do not include the effects of elevation and so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means.</p>

                        <p>One of the most popular myths about the use of solar energy is that on cloudy days there will not be any electricity generation. However, this is not true. Consider the systems below;</p>
                        <h4 id="solar-pv-systems-design-factor" class="subsubsection-heading">Solar PV Systems</h4>
                        <p>In a cloudy day Solar PV panels produce electricity from diffused sunlight. The amount of energy that can be collected is certainly less than the amount that can be captured on a sunny day where the process of collection depends on degree of sunlight. This energy can be stored in batteries to cater to needs during the night.</p>
                        <h4 id="concentrating-solar-thermal-heating-systems-design-factor" class="subsubsection-heading">i. Concentrating Solar Thermal Heating Systems</h4>
                        <p>Concentrating collectors produce electricity from direct sunlight. So they work best in climates that have a high amount of direct solar radiation. They do not function on cloudy days when available solar radiation is mostly diffused. The amount of useful heat they produce is mainly a function of the intensity of solar radiation available, the size of the reflector, how well they concentrate solar energy onto the receiver, the characteristics of the absorber, and the control of the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid.</p>

                        <p>Accurate sizing of the load involves analyzing the various components in the load list in terms of energy level requirements. It includes the current drawn by each component, Operating voltage range of that component and its expected duty cycle.</p>

                        <p>For equipment loads that are variable or pulsating, identify "peak" current levels unless definite patterns or duty cycles are determinable. Consider it when designed any PV system.</p>
                        <h4 id="worst-case-scenarios-load" class="subsubsection-heading">iii. Worst case scenarios</h4>
                        <p>Assessment of worst case scenario is extremely important during the design process because any small increment in load apart from already assessed load can lead to system un-balance or a cycling down of battery capacity.

                        <h4 id="plan-future-load" class="subsubsection-heading">iv. Plan for the future</h4>
                        <p>The system must be designed focusing on the future needs. The system must be scalable to cater to the needs of expansion within its projected life cycle.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A Solar array is one of the major subsystems of any solar power generating system. Solar arrays are formed by connecting solar "modules" in a series and/or a parallel arrangement. These arrays produce direct current with respect to the incident solar radiation on them. The following are some of the factors that need to be considered in designing solar array for power generation:</p>
                        <h4 id="collector-size-array-design" class="subsubsection-heading">i. Collector size</h4>
                        <p>The required solar collector area depends on the solar insolation level of a particular region. A region with poor insolation level will need a larger collector area than one with high insolation levels. Once insolation level of a region is known, the required collector size and energy output can be computed with some precision.</p>
                        <h4 id="selection-appropriate-module" class="subsubsection-heading">ii. Selection of most appropriate module</h4>
                        <p>Solar modules are often rated on the basis of peak watts, and their electrical characteristics are described on a current-voltage curve popularly known as I-V curve. However, the most important factor is the module's behavior under expected operating conditions. One very important concern is module's charging voltage generation under expected high temperature. It must be adequate to charge the battery after providing for system losses.</p>
                        <h4 id="dirt-contaminating-effects" class="subsubsection-heading">iii. Dirt and Other contaminating effects</h4>
                        <p>Dirt and other contaminants including bird-droppings on the face of the solar array can reduce the power output power. Site conditions should be assessed to gauge the problems associated with contaminants. The mitigating solutions like special mounting considerations, more frequent cleaning of the solar modules is recommend. If the tilt angle of the array is less than $30^{\circ}$, buildup of dirt and other contaminants can be expected to be faster.</p>
                        <h4 id="orientation-tilt-issues" class="subsubsection-heading">iv. Orientation and Tilt issues</h4>
                        <p>The specific orientation and tilt of the solar array should be adopted to optimize system power during the worst-case periods of the year and when the average solar insolation is lowest and load requirements are highest. It may be desirable in certain locations to increase the array tilt to aid the clearing of snow and ice.</p>
                        <h4 id="design-balance-systems-bos" class="subsubsection-heading">v. Design of Balance of Systems (BOS)</h4>
                        <p>Design of Balance of Systems is a very important factor in system design. Balance of systems includes the Charge controller, Battery, Cables etc. Balance of systems must be designed in such a way that it is neither too small nor too large. Battery selection and sizing is critical to overall system performance and reliability. The battery serves as an energy buffer storing excess energy produced by the solar array during the day and releasing that energy as required during night and periods of inclement weather when the array is unable to support the load. The following are some important factors that need to be considered in designing a battery bank. The battery should be capable of handling both the physical and electrical rigors of the application, while providing the desired life expectancy and reliability. Key areas to be considered include:</p>

                        <p>The primary instrument used to measure global solar irradiance is the <dfn>pyranometer</dfn>. It measures the sun's energy received from all directions (steradian) in the hemisphere, above the plane of the instrument. Global solar irradiance is the sum total of direct solar radiance and diffused solar irradiance. The most common pyranometer design uses a thermopile (multiple thermocouples connected in series) attached to a thin blackened absorbing surface shielded from convective loss and insulated against conductive losses. When placed in the sun, the surface attains a temperature proportional to the amount of radiant energy falling on it. The temperature is measured and converted through accurate calibration into a readable format of the global solar irradiance. Pyranometers may also be used to measure the global solar irradiance on inclined surfaces. An example would be measurements from a pyranometer placed in the same plane as a tilted solar collector. As can be seen from the sketch in Figure 8.2, this measurement now includes solar energy reflected from surrounding surfaces.</p>

                        <p>The direct normal component of the solar irradiance can be measured by an instrument called <dfn>Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer</dfn>, (NIP). This device, shown in Figure 8.3 is essentially a thermopile pyranometer placed at the end of a long tube that is aimed at the sun. A two-axis tracking mechanism is incorporated to maintain the sun's disc within the acceptance cone of the instrument.</p>

                        <h3 id="diffused-solar-irradiance" class="subsection-heading">iii. Diffused Solar Irradiance</h3>
                        <p>Pyranometers can also be used to measure the diffuse component of the global horizontal radiation. It can be done by providing a "shadowing" device just large enough to block out the direct irradiance coming from the sun's disc. To avoid moving a shadowing disc throughout the day, a shadow band is often incorporated. This band must be adjusted often during the year to keep it in the ecliptic plane. Since the shadow band blocks part of the sky, corrections for this blockage must be used. Recently, rotating shadow band pyranometers have come into general use. With this design, the shadow band rotates slowly about the pyranometer blocking the direct irradiance from the sun every time it passes in front of the pyranometer. The signal from the pyranometer reads global horizontal irradiance most of the time with reductions down to the diffuse irradiance level when the shadow band passes between the sun and the pyranometer. This design gives the advantage of using a single pyranometer to measure both global horizontal and diffuse horizontal solar irradiance.</p>

This is the "duration of sunshine". The traditional standard instrument used to measure this parameter is the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder. This instrument consists of a glass sphere that focuses the direct solar radiation and burns a trace on a special pasteboard card. These recorders have been replaced in most installations by photo detector activated 'sunshine switches.' The data produced by these instruments are of minimal use to engineers because there is no measure of intensity other than "threshold" intensity.</p>

                        <p>When designing a solar energy system, the best way to predict its energy-production performance is by calculating the minute-by-minute solar irradiance levels over the lifetime of the system with respect to exact location of the system. Since weather patterns are difficult to predict and are somewhat random with regard to time and place, the system designer is forced to accept historical data, recorded at a different location and with values reconstructed from incomplete data records. Because of the inherent variability of future solar irradiance, historical records are an extremely useful analytical tool appropriate for a wide range of applications.</p>
                        <p>However, the designer must keep in mind that system performance predicted using even the best historical data may not necessarily represent the future output of the system.</p>

For example, solar radiation data for January of maybe 30 different years is searched to determine the year in which the January was typical or average. Next, 30 different February data sets are searched to determine the typical February. As is usually the case, the typical January and the typical February may not be from the same year. Typical months are determined for the remaining months and some data smoothing done for the transition between months. An hour-by-hour database of readings for all recorded weather parameters from each of the 'typical' months is then generated and is called a Typical Meteorological Year.</p>

                        <p>A photovoltaic cell may be represented by the equivalent circuit model shown in Figure 8.6. This model consists of current due to optical generation ( $I_{L}$ ), a diode that generates a current [$I_{s} e^{qV/kT}$], a series resistance ($r_{s}$) and shunt resistance ($r_{sh}$). The series resistance is due to the resistance of the metal contacts, ohmic losses in the front surface of the cell, impurity concentrations and junction depth. The series resistance is an important parameter because it reduces both the short-circuit current and the maximum power output of the cell. Ideally, the series resistance should be $0 \Omega$ ($r_{s}=0$). The shunt resistance represents the loss due to surface leakage along the edge of the cell or due to crystal defects. Ideally, the shunt resistance should be infinite ($r_{sh}=\infty$).</p>

These points are illustrated in Figure 8.7 which shows a typical forward bias I-V curve of an illuminated PV cell. The maximum power point ($P_{\text {max}}$) is the product of the maximum cell current ($I_{\text {max}}$) and voltage ($V_{\text {max}}$) where the power output of the cell is greatest. This point is located at the "knee" of the curve.</p>

                        <p>The first step in designing a solar PV system is to find out the total power and energy consumption of all loads that need to be supplied by the solar PV system as follows:</p>
                        <h4 id="calculate-watt-hours-appliances" class="subsubsection-heading">1.1 Calculate total Watt-hours per day for each appliance used.</h4>
                        <p>Add the Watt-hours needed for all appliances together to get the total Watt-hours per day which must be delivered to the appliances.</p>
                        <h4 id="calculate-watt-hours-pv-modules" class="subsubsection-heading">1.2 Calculate total Watt-hours per day needed from the PV modules.</h4>
                        <p>Multiply the total appliances Watt-hours per day times 1.3 (the energy lost in the system) to get the total Watt-hours per day which must be provided by the panels.</p>
                        <h3 id="size-pv-modules-sizing" class="subsection-heading">2. Size the PV modules</h3>
                        <p>Different size of PV modules will produce different amount of power. To find out the sizing of PV module, the total peak watt produced needs. The peak watt (Wp) produced depends on size of the PV module and climate of site location. We have to consider "panel generation factor" which is different in each site location. For Kenya, if the panel generation factor is 3.43 then to determine the sizing of PV modules, calculate as follows:</p>
                        <h4 id="calculate-watt-peak-needed" class="subsubsection-heading">2.1 Calculate the total Watt-peak rating needed for PV modules</h4>
                        <p>Divide the total Watt-hours per day needed from the PV modules (from item 1.2) by 3.43 to get the total Watt-peak rating needed for the PV panels needed to operate the appliances.</p>
                        <h4 id="calculate-number-pv-panels" class="subsubsection-heading">2.2 Calculate the number of PV panels for the system</h4>
                        <p>Divide the answer obtained in item 2.1 by the rated output Watt-peak of the PV modules available to you. Increase any fractional part of result to the next highest full number and that will be the number of PV modules required. Result of the calculation is the minimum number of PV panels. If more PV modules are installed, the system will perform better and battery life will be improved. If fewer PV modules are used, the system may not work at all during cloudy periods and battery life will be shortened.</p>
