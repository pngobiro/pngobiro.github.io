Note that even if one cell is shaded, the output of a crystalline module will fall considerably.

Their advantage is that they are safe and secure, although it may be difficult to clean modules mounted high on the roof. Brackets may be constructed so that modules can be pivoted downward for easy cleaning or so that their angle can be adjusted seasonally. Never mount modules directly on to the roof without leaving space underneath them. Never make roof mounts the highest point on the roof, as they can attract lightning.</span>

                        <p>If water penetration is observed, apply silicon sealant to prevent further water penetration. And claim from dealer for warranty. Many manufacturers give warranties of five years to ten years. However, the warranty is for supply of new PV module only and does not include labor and transport cost for replacement.</p>
                        <p>Theft is another common problem. Security of PV module is essential.</p>
                        <p>If a battery is disconnected while the appliances are on, a high voltage from the PV module directly reaches the appliances and will damage them.</p>
