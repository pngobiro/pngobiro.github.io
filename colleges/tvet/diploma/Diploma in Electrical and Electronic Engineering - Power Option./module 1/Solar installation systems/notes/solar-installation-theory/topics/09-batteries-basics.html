                        <p>During the charging stage, water of electrolyte is broken down into gas (oxygen and hydrogen) raising the specific gravity of the electrolyte. Loss of water reduces electrolyte level. When electrolyte level is lower than the indicated level, distilled water must be added to recover the level. At full charge stage, a unit cell voltage is $2.4-2.5 \mathrm{~V}(14.4 \mathrm{~V}-15 \mathrm{~V}$ for 6 cells) depends on type of battery. If overcharging occurs, loss of water tends to escalate. For maintenance free batteries especially the gel type battery, overcharging damages the battery permanently. When charging is completed, the voltage drops quickly to its stable level.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Stratification</dfn> occurs when electrolyte in flooded-cells separates into layers, with the heavier electrolyte 'sinking' to the bottom of the cell and the lower density electrolyte floating to the top of the cell. Not only does this give false hydrometer readings, it also decreases the performance of the cell. Avoid stratification by occasionally giving an equalizing charge to the battery - the intense bubbling of equalization mixes up the acid.</p>
                        <p>Another way is to simply shake a battery once a week. To shake a battery, lift it up to approximately 3 cm on one side of the battery and then down it. Repeat the action 10 times.</p>
                        <p>Do not lift up the battery too high otherwise electrolyte will spill out.</p>
