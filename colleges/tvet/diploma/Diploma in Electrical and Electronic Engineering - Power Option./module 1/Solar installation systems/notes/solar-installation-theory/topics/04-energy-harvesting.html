                        <p>Parabolic trough technology is the most widespread among utility-scale solar thermal plants. The potential of this type of concentrating collectors is very high and can provide output fluid temperatures in the range up to $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. A parabolic trough is a linear-focus collector, which consists of a cylindrically curved parabolic mirror, which reflects the sunlight onto a tubular receiver positioned in the focus line of the parabola. The tubular receiver contains the fluid that absorbs heat and transfers it via circulation to the boiler or another device to produce steam.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-06-1.jpg" alt="Image showing a parabolic trough solar collector system with rows of curved mirrors focusing sunlight onto a central tube." class="content-image">
                        <p>Rows of parabolic mirrors are mounted in parallel on either a north-south axis (typical) or an east-west axis (there are pros and cons to each orientation based on location and energy production requirements) and move to track the sun across the sky. The tubes are very carefully designed to absorb solar radiation and transfer the heat to the heat exchange fluid passing through the tube. The fluid is pumped through the absorber tubes that are connected in series and parallel. Some systems employ an insulated storage tank to enable power generation when the solar resource is either intermittent (due to something like cloud cover) or unavailable (typically during the early evening hours). The heat transfer fluid is then passed through the storage tank if it exists and then pumped to heat exchangers to transfer the heat to water (except in the case of a direct steam generation where water is already the heat transfer fluid and a heat exchanger is not needed) to generate steam for expansion in a steam turbine to generate electricity.</p>

By concentrating the sunlight to a single spot, the intensity of the receiving solar energy is magnified many times over with each mirror or lens acting as a single sun shining directly at the same focal point on the dish meaning that more overall power per square meter of the dish is achieved.</p>

                             <p>A solar flat plate collector typically consists of a large heat absorbing plate, usually, a large sheet of copper or aluminum as they are both good conductors of heat, which is painted or chemically etched black to absorb as much solar radiation as possible for maximum efficiency.</p>
                             <p>This blackened heat-absorbing surface has several parallel copper pipes or tubes called risers, running lengthways across the plate which contain the heat transfer fluid, typically water.</p>
                             <p>These copper pipes are bonded, soldered, or brazed directly to the absorber plate to ensure maximum surface contact and heat transfer. Sunlight heats the absorbing surface which increases in temperature. As the plate gets hotter this heat is conducted through the risers and absorbed by the fluid flowing inside the copper pipes which is then used by the household.</p>
