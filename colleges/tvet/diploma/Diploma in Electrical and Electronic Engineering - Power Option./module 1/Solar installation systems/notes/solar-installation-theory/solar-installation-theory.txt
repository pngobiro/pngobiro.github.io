\section*{INTRODUCTION TO SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES}

Off-grid solar electricity is a convenient form of electricity for people far from the electric grid or for people who want electric power without having to 'hookup'.

Solar electricity is electric power generated from sunlight using devices called solar cell modules. Solar electricity can replace, cost-effectively, small applications of petroleum-fueled generators, grid power and even dry cell batteries.

The technology has spread rapidly throughout the world for both on-grid and off grid application. Millions of rural off-grid homes are using solar photovoltaic (PV) systems throughout the developed and developing world. Small off-grid solar electric systems differ from grid or generator electricity in a number of ways:
- Small off-grid PV systems are based on extra-low-voltage direct current
- electricity, not low-voltage 230 or 110 volts (V) alternating current (see the
- Glossary for a definition of 'extra-low' and 'low' voltage).
- Off-grid PV systems usually store energy in batteries.
- Electricity is generated on-site by photovoltaic modules.
- For systems to be economical, all electricity produced must be used efficiently.

\section*{THE SOLAR RESOURCE}

The sun is the Earth's nearest star and the source of virtually all the Earth's energy, producing $3.8 \times 1023 \mathrm{~kW}$ of power in huge nuclear fission reactions. Most of this power is lost in space, but the tiny fraction that does reach the Earth, $1.73 \times 1016 \mathrm{~kW}$, is thousands of times more than enough to provide all of humanity's energy needs.

The energy we derive from wood fuel, petroleum products, coal, hydroelectricity and even our food originates indirectly from the sun. Solar energy is captured and stored by plants. We use this energy when we burn firewood or eat food. The sun also powers rainfall cycles that fill rivers from which we extract hydroelectricity. Petroleum and coal are made up of the fossilized remains of plants and animals that collected energy from the sun thousands of years ago.

Energy can also be harvested from the sun directly for heating, drying, cooking, distilling, raising steam and generating electricity. Many types of equipment can be used to collect solar energy. These include flat plate solar thermal panels and evacuated tubes, which harvest solar energy for heating water, and solar concentrators that focus the rays of the sun into high energy beams to produce heat for electricity generation (known as concentrated solar power or CSP).

\section*{CONVERTING SOLAR ENERGY}

Sunshine has traditionally been used for drying all types of things: clothes, agricultural produce, cash crops and bricks - even in the production of salt from sea water. To make use of solar energy, we must convert it into useful forms. As shown, solar energy can be usefully transformed in three ways:

- solar energy to chemical energy;
- solar energy to heat energy;
- solar energy to electrical energy.

\section*{SOLAR ENERGY TO CHEMICAL ENERGY}

Green plants transform solar energy to chemical energy in sugar and cellulose by the process of photosynthesis (all biomass contains chemically stored solar energy). Unfortunately, we have not yet developed a way to directly transform solar energy into chemical energy. Photosynthesis remains a secret of plants!

Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-04.jpg?height=176&width=1154&top_left_y=426&top_left_x=411)
- Photosynthesis is also used by algae to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Oxygen is liberated as a by-product and light is considered as a major factor to complete the process of photosynthesis.
- Photosynthesis occurs when plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Leaves contain microscopic cellular organelles known as chloroplasts.

\section*{SOLAR ENERGY TO HEAT ENERGY}

Solar heating devices transform solar energy into heat that is used for drying, water-heating, space-heating, cooking and distilling water. CSP plants convert water to steam that is used to generate electricity. Solar thermal energy is most easily used in applications that require relatively small amounts of heat. The cheapest and simplest uses of solar energy (e.g. solar driers and water heaters) raise the temperature of air or water by $20-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(36-72^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. When more energy and higher temperatures are needed, solar energy must be concentrated, transported and/or stored, greatly increasing the cost and complexity of solar equipment needed. Solar energy to electrical energy.

\section*{SOLAR ENERGY TO ELECTRICAL ENERGY}

Solar electric devices transform solar energy into electrical energy. This can be used to directly power electrical devices such as pumps and fans - or it can be stored in batteries to power lights, televisions, refrigerators and other appliances (these appliances are often used mainly at night when the sun has gone down).

\section*{SOLAR RADIATION PRINCIPLES}

Sunshine reaches the earth as a type of energy called radiation. Radiation is composed of millions of high-energy particles called photons. Each unit of solar radiation, or photon, carries a fixed amount of energy. Depending on the amount of energy that it carries, solar radiation falls into different categories including infrared (i.e. heat), visible (radiation that we can see) and ultraviolet (very high energy radiation).

Solar energy arrives at the edge of the Earth's atmosphere at a constant rate of about 1350 watts per square metre (W/m2): this is called the 'solar constant'. However, not all this energy reaches the Earth's surface. The atmosphere absorbs and reflects much of it, and by the time it reaches the Earth's surface, it is reduced to a maximum of about $1000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} 2$.

\section*{SOLAR RADIATION}

This is how sunlight reaches the earth. radiation is composed of millions of high energy particles known as photons. Each unit of solar radiation carries a fixed amount of solar energy.

Solar radiation often called the solar resource, is a general term for the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.

\section*{Types of solar radiation}

\section*{1. Direct Radiation}

The portion of the light that appears to come straight from the Sun, normally called 'sunshine', is known as direct solar radiation. It can be focused to generate very high temperatures or can be used without such concentration in active solar heating systems.

\section*{2. Indirect Radiation (diffuse radiation)}
it is radiation that is reflected by the atmosphere or scattered by clouds, smog, dust, smoke thereby reducing the amount that reaches the ground.

\section*{SOLAR IRRADIANCE}

Solar irradiance refers to the solar radiation actually striking a surface, or the power received per unit area from the sun. This is measured in watts per square meter (W/m2) or kilowatts per square meter ( $\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m} 2$ ). If a solar module is facing the sun directly (i.e. if the module is perpendicular to the sun's rays) irradiance will be much higher than if the module is at a large angle to the sun.

\section*{INSOLATION}

Insolation (a short way of saying incident solar radiation) is a measure of the solar energy received on a specified area over a specified period of time.

Solar energy is classified into two types based on how solar energy is utilized.
- Active Solar Energy
- Passive Solar Energy

\section*{Passive Solar Energy}

The passive solar energy is used directly from the Sun for various applications without using any intermediate devices or converters. By using solar energy passively, we can heat water, water in swimming pools and can even heat houses or buildings. The best example of passive solar energy is drying up clothes in bright daylight.

\section*{Applications}
- Solar heating and cooling
- Daylighting
- Drying up clothes, food products, and other materials

\section*{Active solar energy}

Active solar energy reduces a building's fossil fuel energy requirements for loads operation. An active solar energy source has two major applications. With this energy system, the solar energy from the sun is converted into electricity by using an intermediate circuit (Photovoltaic cells).

Solar panels absorb the energy of the sun and transfer the electricity to the point of usage are placed on the roof of a building or house. A solar heating system can provide a high percentage of domestic energy requirements for heating purposes.

\section*{Applications}
- Active solar space heating
- Active solar water heating
- Active solar pool heating

\section*{METHODS OF SOLAR ENERGY HARVESTING}

Solar energy harvesting is the process of capturing and storing solar energy which is radiated from the sun.

There are various methods for harnessing solar energy as mention below some methods.
- The solar module (solar cells)
- Parabolic reflectors
- Dish reflectors
- Flat plate collectors

\section*{PARABOLIC REFLECTORS}

Parabolic trough technology is the most widespread among utility-scale solar thermal plants. The potential of this type of concentrating collectors is very high and can provide output fluid temperatures in the range up to $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. A parabolic trough is a linear-focus collector, which consists of a cylindrically curved parabolic mirror, which reflects the sunlight onto a tubular receiver positioned in the focus line of the parabola. The tubular receiver contains the fluid that absorbs heat and transfers it via circulation to the boiler or another device to produce steam.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-06.jpg?height=464&width=797&top_left_y=1473&top_left_x=264)

Rows of parabolic mirrors are mounted in parallel on either a north-south axis (typical) or an east-west axis (there are pros and cons to each orientation based on location and energy production requirements) and move to track the sun across the sky. The tubes are very carefully designed to absorb solar radiation and transfer the heat to the heat exchange fluid passing through the tube. The fluid is pumped through the absorber tubes that are connected in series and parallel. Some systems employ an insulated storage tank to enable power generation when the solar resource is either intermittent (due to something like cloud cover) or unavailable (typically during the early evening hours). The heat transfer fluid is then passed through the storage tank if it exists and then pumped to heat exchangers to transfer the heat to water (except in the case of a direct steam generation where water is already the heat transfer fluid and a heat exchanger is not needed) to generate steam for expansion in a steam turbine to generate electricity.

\section*{DISH REFLECTORS}

Another type of concentrating solar collector that optically reflects and focuses the sun's incident solar energy onto a small receiving area using mirrors or lenses is called a Solar Dish Collector, or more technically, a point focusing collector. By concentrating the sunlight to a single spot, the intensity of the receiving solar energy is magnified many times over with each mirror or lens acting as a single sun shining directly at the same focal point on the dish meaning that more overall power per square meter of the dish is achieved.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-07.jpg?height=757&width=903&top_left_y=815&top_left_x=551)

\section*{FLAT PLATE COLLECTORS}

A Flat Plate Collector is a heat exchanger that converts the radiant solar energy from the sun into heat energy using the well-known greenhouse effect. It collects, or captures, solar energy and uses that energy to heat water in the home for bathing, washing, and heating, and can even be used to heat outdoor swimming pools and hot tubs.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-07.jpg?height=538&width=795&top_left_y=2115&top_left_x=245)

\section*{Construction of a flat plate collector}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-08.jpg?height=541&width=744&top_left_y=546&top_left_x=242)

\section*{These are the main components of a typical flat-plate solar collector:}
- Black surface - absorbent of the incident solar energy
- Glazing cover - a transparent layer that transmits radiation to the absorber, but prevents radiative and convective heat loss from the surface
- Tubes containing heating fluid to transfer the heat from the collector
- Support structure to protect the components and hold them in place
- Insulation covering sides and bottom of the collector to reduce heat losses
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-08.jpg?height=701&width=1212&top_left_y=1774&top_left_x=462)

A solar flat plate collector typically consists of a large heat absorbing plate, usually, a large sheet of copper or aluminum as they are both good conductors of heat, which is painted or chemically etched black to absorb as much solar radiation as possible for maximum efficiency.

This blackened heat-absorbing surface has several parallel copper pipes or tubes called risers, running lengthways across the plate which contain the heat transfer fluid, typically water.

These copper pipes are bonded, soldered, or brazed directly to the absorber plate to ensure maximum surface contact and heat transfer. Sunlight heats the absorbing surface which increases in temperature. As the plate gets hotter this heat is conducted through the risers and absorbed by the fluid flowing inside the copper pipes which is then used by the household.

\section*{Some advantages of the flat-plate collectors are that they are:}
- Easy to manufacture
- Low cost
- Collect both beam and diffuse radiation
- Permanently fixed (no sophisticated positioning or tracking equipment is required)
- Little maintenance

\section*{BASIC SOLAR ENERGY PRINCIPLES}

As mentioned previously, we are able to harvest solar energy in two forms: as heat and as electricity. For solar thermal applications, radiant energy is directed using reflectors and concentrators. It is collected as heat by trapping and absorbing it on specially treated surfaces and by using the 'greenhouse effect'.

Principles of solar thermal technologies are provided herein for general information. It is good practice to understand the difference between solar thermal and solar electric technologies. Also, because solar electricity is not practical for generating heat, many off-grid PV users prefer to heat water and cook using solar thermal technology.

Finally, some solar electric equipment also uses principles more commonly associated with solar thermal technologies.

\section*{CONCENTRATING SOLAR ENERGY}

Solar concentrators and reflectors help overcome the spread-out nature of solar energy. They redirect solar radiation incident over a large area, reflecting or focusing it to a small area where it is trapped or harnessed at high temperatures.

Concentrators make use of reflective surfaces and shapes that 'bounce' radiation off their surfaces and direct it to a focal point. By covering a large area with solar concentrators, most of the total radiation that falls on that area can be focused into a small area and absorbed as heat. Concentrators are useful only with direct (rather than diffuse) solar energy. They must be moved constantly to follow the changing position of the sun in the sky. Concentrated solar power (CSP) stations do this on an industrial scale, collecting and converting solar heat to electricity that is sold into the grid.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-10.jpg?height=546&width=460&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=321)
'Parabolic dishes' are bowl-shaped mirrors that focus radiant energy upon one point where the energy is concentrated and utilized (some solar cookers use these). 'Parabolic troughs' focus radiation along a pipe that runs through the centre.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-10.jpg?height=458&width=555&top_left_y=1030&top_left_x=262)
'Simple reflectors' are flat mirrors or polished aluminum surfaces arranged around a device to increase the radiation incident upon it. Solar cookers and concentrating-type solar electric systems commonly use these.

\section*{TRAPPING SOLAR ENERGY}

Solar energy is trapped as heat using properties of heat absorption, heat transfer, insulation and the 'greenhouse effect'.

Solar radiation is absorbed on surfaces as heat. The amount of heat radiation absorbed depends upon the incident surface area, the color and material of the surface, and the angle and intensity of the incoming radiation. Solar energy is best absorbed on surfaces that are perpendicular to the incoming solar radiation.

Dark-colored (i.e. black), non-reflective metal surfaces absorb solar radiation best. Solar waterheaters, stills, driers and cookers make use of black painted absorber surfaces for capturing heat.

The greenhouse effect, uses the properties of light and heat energy to accumulate heat from solar energy. Radiant energy can pass through glass (or clear plastic) surfaces, but infrared (heat) energy cannot. Thus, solar radiation passes through the glass windows of a sealed box, is absorbed by the surface behind the glass and re-radiated as heat which cannot pass back through the glass. This heat is trapped inside the solar collector and causes the temperature to rise inside the box. Solar box-cookers, solar driers, solar stills and solar-heated homes use the greenhouse effect to gain heat. Flat plate collectors, used in solar water-heating systems, take
advantage of both the greenhouse effect and absorption principles to trap solar energy for heating air and water.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-11.jpg?height=669&width=635&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=274)

Solar heat, once collected, is either stored or used immediately. With solar water-heaters, captured heat is stored in the water, which is transferred by pipe to insulated water tanks.

\section*{SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGIES}

\section*{SOLAR CROP DRIERS}

Solar driers heat air with collected solar radiation and use it to dry crops. There are two parts in the solar drying process. First, solar radiation is captured and used to heat air, increasing its ability to hold and carry water vapor. The second part of the process is the actual drying, during which heated air moves through the product, warming it and extracting moisture. Drying takes place in a large box called the 'drying chamber'. Air is either heated in a flat plate collector or through a window in the drying chamber.

Indirect solar driers have a flat plate collector and a separate drying chamber that allow efficient use of solar energy and more control over the drying process. The solar collector heats air and, by convection, forces it through racks of drying products in the drying chamber

\section*{SOLAR WATER-HEATERS}

Solar water-heaters (SWHs) raise the temperature of water for bathing, washing, cleaning and cooking. The collectors consist of glass-covered panels (or evacuated tubes) with dark-colored pipes inside. Water (or a heat transfer fluid) flows through the pipes and is warmed by the sun, then stored in insulated tanks for use in washing and bathing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-12.jpg?height=915&width=1368&top_left_y=513&top_left_x=244)

\section*{SOLAR COOKERS}

Solar cookers concentrate and collect solar energy as heat for preparing meals. They can be divided into two general groups.
'Box-type cookers' are the simplest, least expensive and successfully disseminated solar cookers. A solar box-cooker is a large insulated box containing an enclosed cooking space with a window. One or more mirrors (or aluminum sheets) reflect radiation into the box through the window. Food is placed inside the cooking space. When the window is closed and the cooker faces the sun, the inside cooking temperature may rise above $160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(320^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Box-cookers can be cheaply made and are best used for slow-cooking meals such as stews, porridge and rice dishes or for baking.
'Concentrating-type cookers' concentrate and focus solar energy as heat on to the vessel containing the food. Food is placed in the cooking vessel during operation, the vessel is placed on the cooker grill and the concentrator is adjusted to focus the sun's rays on to the pot. If the concentrator is properly oriented, the cooking vessel's bottom immediately heats up. Direct solar cookers produce temperatures high enough to roast or fry. Water reaches boiling point just as quickly as it does use conventional cookers. Some very large concentrating-type cookers are used to generate steam which then cooks the food in pressurized vessels.

\section*{APPLICATIONS OF SOLAR ENERGY}

Solar energy can effectively replace small applications of the fuel generators some of the applications may include
- Solar home systems to power various electronics and electrical appliances in homes i.e. Lights, television, radio, for charging mobile phones, etc.
- Small industries and institutions i.e. schools, small businesses, etc. to power lights, small machines, security systems.
- Telecommunication systems - used in areas with no access to power hence a standalone PV system is used to power communication devices.
- Health center for refrigeration of vaccines and lighting purposes
- Water pumping
- Electric fencing
- Solar street lighting
- Road sign illumination
- Railway and marine signal lighting
- Security systems i.e. fire and alarm systems

\section*{SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS IN KENYA}

Several solar power stations are operational or under construction are 55 MW Garissa, 40 MW Rumuruti, 40 MW Radiant, 40 MW Eldosol, 40 MW Alten, 10 MW Kenyatta University, 52 MW Malindi and 50 MW Kopere.

\section*{SOLAR PV COMPONENTS}

The components of a solar pv system include: -
1. Solar modules
2. Batteries
3. Charge controller
4. Inverter
5. Loads

\section*{SOLAR MODULES}

A PV module converts solar energy (sunlight) into electricity. A common material for PV module is silicon semiconductor.

The photovoltaic is the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity. Light striking solar cells is converted into electric energy. This occurs according to a principle called the 'photo-electric effect'. Solar electric devices are also called photovoltaic or PV devices.

The basic unit of solar electric production is the solar cell. Light striking solar cells creates a current powered by incoming light energy. They produce electricity when placed in sunlight. Most solar cells do not get used up or damaged while generating electric power. Their life is limited only by breakage or long-term exposure to the elements. If a high-quality solar cell module is properly protected, it should last for more than 25 years.

TYPES OF PV MODULES
There are three types of silicon PV module shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-16.jpg?height=1386&width=1554&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=254)

\section*{MONOCRYSTALLINE}

Monocrystalline solar cells are made out of cylindrical silicon ingots. Four sides are cut out of the cylindrical ingots to make silicon wafers, which is what gives monocrystalline panels their characteristic look.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-16.jpg?height=544&width=1221&top_left_y=2101&top_left_x=326)

\section*{Advantages}
- The pure silicon content of monocrystalline solar cells makes them the most efficient solar panels among all other varieties. Thus they have an efficiency quotient of between 15\%-20\%
- They are the most space-efficient. The solar cells are capable of producing four times more electricity to a quarter-space utilization for their installation.
- The solar cells exhibit better performance in low light conditions as compared to polycrystalline solar cells.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Although monocrystalline silicon cells can perform well in low light conditions, the entire circuit can break down if the panels are in full shade conditions.
- Dirt and polluted ambiance also can hamper the performance of these types of solar cells.
- The basic shape of monocrystalline silicon cells is cylindrical with round edges. Although this characteristic shape accounts for its functional effectiveness, the structure feature leads to substantial wastage of original silicon.
- Monocrystalline silicon cells are vulnerable to temperature fluctuations. They became ineffective in areas, which have low temperatures and extremely high temperatures.

\section*{POLYCRYSTALLINE SOLAR}

Raw silicon is melted and poured into a square mold, which is then cooled and cut into perfectly square wafers.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-17.jpg?height=463&width=1100&top_left_y=1493&top_left_x=278)

\section*{Advantages}
- The process used to make polycrystalline is simpler and cost-effective.
- The amount of waste silicon is less as compared to monocrystalline
- Polycrystalline solar cells have slightly lower heat tolerance than monocrystalline panels. This means they can perform in slightly worse than monocrystalline solar in high temperatures.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Because of lower silicon purity, polycrystalline solar cells are not quite as efficient as monocrystalline cells.
- Polycrystalline has lower space efficiency, a larger surface to output the same electrical power as compared to monocrystalline solar panels.

\section*{AMORPHOUS SILICON}

Amorphous is the thin film of silicon so that cost is relatively low for small size such as 10 W , 20 W . However, efficiency is much lower than crystalline type as a result the physical dimensions are almost twice as big as compared to monocrystalline type. Major disadvantages are degradation of efficiency and weakness against lightning surge.

It is not recommended to use amorphous type of 25 W or bigger size since price is not different from crystalline type, and the performance is less than crystalline type

\section*{THE I-V CURVE}

I-V curves are used to compare solar cell modules and to predict their performance at various temperatures, voltage loads and levels of insolation. Each solar cell and module has its own particular set of operating characteristics. At a given voltage, a module (or cell) will produce a certain current. These properties are described by the current-voltage curve, better known as the I-V curve.

Figure shows an I-V curve for a module rated at 42 Wp at STC. The left-hand side (I) gives the current the module produces depending on voltage. The bottom side gives the voltage produced by the module at various currents. At each point along the line, you can determine the power of the module by multiplying the current by the voltage. For example, imagine a battery being charged by a module: at 12 volts (Point A, Figure 3.4), the current from the module is 3.2 amps and the power output is 38.4 watts (amps $\times$ volts $=$ power, so $12 \mathrm{~V} \times 3.2 \mathrm{~A}=38.4 \mathrm{~W}$, which is less than the rated 42 Wp ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-18.jpg?height=766&width=1100&top_left_y=1690&top_left_x=392)

There are several points of interest about the I-V curve in Figure

There are several points of interest about the I-V curve in Figure 3.4:
- Isc, the short-circuit current, is the current measured in full sunlight when the positive and negative wires are 'shorted'. In practice, a suitably rated ammeter is attached to the positive and negative leads of the module. On the I-V curve, this is the point where the curve crosses 0 volts (Point B). This is the maximum current that the module is capable of producing.
- Voc, the open circuit voltage, is the voltage measured with an open circuit. It is measured with the module in full sunlight using a voltmeter attached to the positive and negative leads of the module. On the I-V curve, this is the point where the curve crosses 0 amps (Point C ). This is the maximum voltage that the module can produce on a sunny day.
- Pm, the maximum power point, is the point on the I-V curve where the module produces the greatest power (its rated maximum, which in this example is 42 Wp ). The maximum power point is always found at the place where the curve begins to bend steeply downward ('the knee', Point D). It is advisable to operate a module as near to the maximum power point as possible. If, for example, the module in Figure 3.4 is operating a load that demands 16 volts (Point E), power output (at 36 watts) is much less than that at the maximum power at Point D.

In general, the closer the 'knee' of the I-V curve is to the shape of a square, the better output characteristics of the module. Crystalline modules have I-V curves that are more 'square' than thin film modules.

\section*{SIZE (OUTPUT POWER)}

As mentioned previously, the output power of a PV module is indicated as Wp (watt peak). However, Wp of a PV module depends on intensity of sunlight and temperature. Therefore, standard measurements of output power are tested at the condition of $1,000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} 2,25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, AM1.5.

Since the actual operating conditions vary, it is necessary to consider several factors that affect output efficiency of a PV module. Factors that affect output power are;
- Intensity of solar radiation Low solar radiation reduce output power
- Temperature of module High temperature reduce output power Surface temperature of a PV module may go up 50 to $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- Degradation and dust of module Dust on surface of PV module reduces the intensity of solar radiation reaching the solar cell surface. Degradation is high for amorphous type modules.
- Effectiveness of maximum power point Battery charging voltage is different from maximum power point.

Available output power is estimated as,
Wp actual $=\mathrm{K} \times \mathrm{Wp}$ catalog
K is total loss factor mentioned above.
This handout uses 0.8 for crystalline PV modules and 0.6 for amorphous PV modules.

\section*{Example for calculating module output}

Use the calculation below to predict your module's output on a typical day: Operating current at load (amps) $\times$ peak sun hours $($ PSH $)=$ Expected output of module $($ amp-hours $/$ Ah $)$ When charging a battery at 12.6 V , the current output of a module is about 3.1 A . If the site receives 5 peak sun hours, then the module output is: $3.1 \mathrm{~A} \times 5 \mathrm{psh}=15.5 \mathrm{Ah}$

This figure can be multiplied by 12 V to get watt-hours (Wh): $15.5 \mathrm{Ah} \times 12 \mathrm{~V}=186 \mathrm{~Wh}$

\section*{PEAK HOURS}

Available power per day is based on how many hours of sunlight are obtained. Intensity of sunlight during a day is shown below. Total area under this curve is total sunlight. To average this area for calculation, some lower part is moved to upper part and peak part is moved to lower part. This averaged area (hatched area) is same as original area. This averaged hour is called peak hours. To calculate power per day, Wp is multiplied by peak hours.

The value of peak hours depends on areas and should be obtained by actual measurement. As peak hours change daily, there is minimum peak hours, average peak hours and maximum peak hours in a year. Minimum peak hours is normally used to ensure load demand. However, load demand varies and if minimum peak hours is used, the system sizing becomes bigger and costs more.

\section*{Example. 1.}

How much ampere-hour is generated per day with 55 Wp PV module in the area where 5 hours of peak hours is obtained? Wp actual $=\mathrm{K} \times 55 \mathrm{Wp}=0.8 \times 55 \mathrm{Wp}=44 \mathrm{Wp}$
$\mathrm{Wh}=\mathrm{Wp}$ actual $\times$ Peak hours $=44 \mathrm{Wp} \times 5.0 \mathrm{~h}=220 \mathrm{~Wh}$
$\mathrm{Ah}=\mathrm{Wh} / 12 \mathrm{~V}=220 \mathrm{~Wh} / 12 \mathrm{~V}=18.3 \mathrm{Ah}$
The answer is 18.3 Ah per day.

\section*{TILT ANGLE}

To obtain maximum sunlight, a PV module has to face to the sun. Ideally, PV module should track the sun. However, tracking system is expensive and not economical for SHS. Therefore, a PV module is fixed at an optimum tilt angle. Solar radiation changes daily and monthly so that using tilt angle targeted to worst month would be a better solution. However, this method requires actual record of solar radiation throughout the year and worst month of solar radiation is not always a heavy load month.
tilt angle is the latitude plus $5^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}$ and round it to $5^{\circ}$ step.

\section*{Example.}

Show orientation and recommended tilt angle at Harare. Latitude of Harare is $18^{\circ} \mathrm{S}$.
$18^{\circ}+5^{\circ}=23^{\circ}$ then rounded to $25^{\circ}, 18^{\circ}+10^{\circ}=28^{\circ}$ then rounded to $30^{\circ}$ Orientation is North.
Tilt angle is $25^{\circ}$ or $30^{\circ}$.

\section*{MEASUREMENT OF ACTUAL POWER}

It is recommended to measure the actual output of a PV module before you purchase it. Vmp and Imp are necessary to obtain output power. This requires the measurement of I-V curve of the PV module. However, an easy alternative is to measure Voc and Isc and estimate Vmp and Imp.

\section*{MEASUREMENT OF VOC AND ISC}

Place a PV module under the sun for at least 30 minutes to stabilize surface temperature on a sunny day between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.. Then measure Voc measured and Isc measured. Isc measured changes depending on orientation and tilt angle of a PV module. Make sure the PV module is faced to the sun and obtain maximum Isc by adjusting orientation and tilt angle.

\section*{Estimation of Vmp}

The difference between Voc and Vmp is almost same as catalog value and measured value. Therefore, Vmp measured is estimated from Voc measured.

Vmp measured $=$ Voc measured $-($ Voc catalog - Vmp catalog $)$

\section*{Estimation of Imp}

The Ratio between Isc and Imp is almost same as catalog value and measured value. Therefore, Imp measured is obtained from Isc measured.

Imp measured $=$ Isc measured $\times($ Imp catalog $/$ Isc catalog $)$

\section*{CONNECTIONS TO OTHER PV MODULES}

To obtain more power, PV module can be connected in an array. Both parallel and series connection are possible. All modules should be of the same model. It is not recommended to mix modules of different types and sizes.

\section*{PARALLEL CONNECTION}

Total voltage is the average of the PV module voltages.
- Total current is the sum of the PV module current.
- Blocking diode is necessary to prevent reverse current in case of a module is shadowed.
- Blocking diode reduce output voltage to approximately 0.3 to 0.6 V depends on diodes.
- This voltage drop reduces efficiency to approximately 0.97 .

\section*{MOUNTING SOLAR MODULES}

Choose the array mounting location - and the method of mounting - during planning stages and not at the last minute! Choose carefully where to mount your modules. Pole mounts or ground mounts (for larger arrays) are usually preferable to roof mounts. For one to two modules, a pole mount is often the best solution: pole mounts enable easy orientation of the module and can be assembled in a workshop on the ground.

Roof-mounting of solar modules is often a problem for a number of reasons:
- Roofs are very different from each other so no single type of mount is the right one.
- Roofs face different directions.
- Roofs are shaded at different times of the day or year.
- Roofs are easily damaged and can be a dangerous place to work.
- Module-sellers mostly offer modules, not solar-module mounts.
- Customers often do not think about mounting modules until the last minute.

\section*{CHOOSING THE MOUNTING SITE}

When selecting a mounting site, always look for an unshaded position that receives full sunlight throughout the day. Take the following points into consideration when deciding where to put your array.

Modules should be located:
- Off the ground, if possible, so that they are out of the dust and out of the way of humans and animals. Do not locate modules near chimneys or kitchens as they could become covered with soot and smoke.
- Where they will not be shaded between 9.00am and 5.00 pm every day of the year. Check the position of the sun during different times of the day (and during different seasons) to determine whether shadows from trees, TV aerials or other objects will cross the intended module location. Note that even if one cell is shaded, the output of a crystalline module will fall considerably. The 'Solar Pathfinder' is a good tool for figuring out how shade from nearby obstructions will vary daily and seasonally.
-Where they will not get too hot. If installed on a metal roof, module mounts should be at least 10cm (4 inches) above the metal surface, with enough space for air circulation behind the module. If possible, the module should be located where it will be cooled by the wind.
- In a secure location. Do not place modules where they might be stolen. Do not locate them where they might be vandalized or hit by stones.
- As near as possible to the batteries and controller. If the modules are located too far from the controller and batteries, there is a greater possibility of voltage drop and power loss so larger diameter and/or several cables will need to be used.

\section*{METHOD OF MOUNTING}
1. 'Pole mounts' are a good method to ensure modules are mounted at the proper orientation and location. They are good for small arrays (up to four modules). Pole mounts place the modules well off the ground in secure highly visible places. They require metal pipes (steel poles), strong frames and, usually, a foundation. Note that small pole mounts are easily converted into rotatable trackers for single module systems.
2. 'Rooftop mounts' use racks or brackets to fix the array to the roof structure. Their advantage is that they are safe and secure, although it may be difficult to clean modules mounted high on the roof. Brackets may be constructed so that modules can be pivoted downward for easy cleaning or so that their angle can be adjusted seasonally. Never mount modules directly on to the roof without leaving space underneath them. Never make roof mounts the highest point on the roof, as they can attract lightning.
3. 'Ground mounts' are used for arrays of four or more modules (e.g. for water pumps, refrigeration or large home systems with no other suitable place to locate the modules). They secure modules to racks fixed in concrete foundations and may be fenced off to protect the array from animals and curious people. mounted at in your area. Make sure that rain water can easily run off the modules (i.e. as a minimum they must have at least a $10^{\circ}$ tilt). Never mount modules flat.
4. . 'Tracking mounts' can automatically track the sun throughout the day. However, they are generally not economical unless you have more than four modules. They add extra cost and complications to the system, and may increase system management work (or likelihood of breakdown). follow the sun as its orientation changes from north to south. Note that if

\section*{MODULE MAINTENANCE}

Since modules have no moving parts, they require minimum maintenance. Keeping the glass surface clean is the most important task. Also, be aware of shade from plants or trees that grow up around the array. Check occasionally for loose nuts and corrosion in the mounting hardware. Clean dirt and dust build-ups on modules (once a month)
1. Solar modules must be kept clean to produce maximum power. Dust collecting on top of the module can greatly reduce electric output. During the dry seasons, inspect the module every two weeks for collected dust by running a finger along the top. Also, look for bird-droppings, leaves, streaks or signs of damage.
2. Clean modules with water and, if necessary, a mild soap (solvents should never be used). Wipe the glass with your hands, a sponge or a soft cloth (rough cloths or brushes will scratch the glass - do not use). Make sure all surfaces of the array are fully rinsed and streak-free.

Check array output and module/array connections (once a year)
1. Check the output of the array at noon on a sunny day. Measure the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current (Isc). Compare these with previous figures, and note any change.
2. Inspect the junction box on the back of each module to make sure that the wiring is tight. Make sure that wires have not been chewed or pulled out. Ensure that no insects or lizards are living in the junction boxes. Remove plant growth, spider webs and debris from the back of the array.

\section*{COMMON PROBLEMS}

A PV module is basically very reliable and lasts for about 20 years. This lifetime is limited by the lifetime of EVA resin used to laminate cells but not the cell itself. However, poor production quality causes the following problems.
- Water penetration into cells Improper assembling process
- Corrosion of ribbon Improper assembling process
- Crack of surface glass. Heat stress, hail snow.

If water penetration is observed, apply silicon sealant to prevent further water penetration. And claim from dealer for warranty. Many manufacturers give warranties of five years to ten years. However, the warranty is for supply of new PV module only and does not include labor and transport cost for replacement.

Theft is another common problem. Security of PV module is essential.
If a battery is disconnected while the appliances are on, a high voltage from the PV module directly reaches the appliances and will damage them.

\section*{SPECIFICATIONS}

\section*{Type}

Use the monocrystalline or polycrystalline types of modules. The amorphous type is not recommended unless used for smaller application ( 20 W or less) such as solar lantern.

\section*{Number of cells}

A minimum of 36 cells is required. A PV module with 34 or less cells may not be enough to charge battery at high temperatures (tropical condition).

\section*{Parameters}

Check if manufacturer has adequate production testing facilities to monitor quality of daily production of modules. If manufacture does not have such facilities, do not buy from them.

\section*{BATTERIES}

\section*{BASICS OF A BATTERY}

SHS use rechargeable batteries to store electricity. There are several kinds of rechargeable batteries such as Lead-acid, Ni-MH (Nickel Metal Hydride), Lithium-ion, etc. The most suitable rechargeable battery for SHS is lead-acid battery.

Advantages of Lead-acid battery are:
- Large capacity
- Low cost (Cost per capacity is the most economical among available batteries.)

Disadvantages are:
- Need to maintain electrolyte level
- Weakness against over charge and over discharge.
- Complicated behavior (capacity varies based on discharge rate and temperature)
- Heavy
- Danger of sulfuric acid
- Environmental hazard of lead electrode.

\section*{MECHANISM OF A LEAD-ACID BATTERY}

A battery consists of lead alloy electrodes and electrolyte. On the positive electrode is lead dioxide and on the negative electrode is lead. The electrolyte is sulfuric acid diluted with distilled water. Reversible electro-chemical reaction enables battery to store electricity and discharge electricity. One-unit cell produces 2 V . For 12 V battery, 6 cells are connected in series.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-26.jpg?height=760&width=1461&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=286)

\section*{CHARGING STAGE}

During the charging stage, water of electrolyte is broken down into gas (oxygen and hydrogen) raising the specific gravity of the electrolyte. Loss of water reduces electrolyte level. When electrolyte level is lower than the indicated level, distilled water must be added to recover the level. At full charge stage, a unit cell voltage is $2.4-2.5 \mathrm{~V}(14.4 \mathrm{~V}-15 \mathrm{~V}$ for 6 cells) depends on type of battery. If overcharging occurs, loss of water tends to escalate. For maintenance free batteries especially the gel type battery, overcharging damages the battery permanently. When charging is completed, the voltage drops quickly to its stable level.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-26.jpg?height=775&width=1486&top_left_y=1560&top_left_x=268)

\section*{DISCHARGING STAGE}
specific gravity becomes low. When the battery is fully discharged, the voltage of each unit cell is 1.75 V ( 10.5 V for 6 cells). Over discharge beyond this voltage damages battery permanently.

When a unit cell voltage is below approximately 1.95 V ( 11.7 V for 6 cells) sulfuric crystal is produced on surface of electrode. This phenomenon is called sulphation and reduces the lifetime of battery. It is very important to maintain battery voltage above $1.95 \mathrm{~V}(11.7 \mathrm{~V}$ for 6 cells). When load is disconnected, the battery voltage will recover to its stable level
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-27.jpg?height=798&width=1041&top_left_y=509&top_left_x=296)

\section*{STATE OF CHARGE (SOC)}

Battery voltage does not always indicate the state of charge. For a more accurate measurement of charging status is more appropriate to measure specific gravity of the electrolyte. Specific gravity slightly varies depending on batteries.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Specific Gravity & State of Charge \\
\hline \hline 1.27 & $100 \%$ \\
\hline 1.23 & $80 \%$ \\
\hline 1.19 & $50 \%$ \\
\hline 1.15 & $20 \%$ \\
\hline 1.12 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{SELF-DISCHARGING}

Batteries can affect a self-discharge. From a full charge, if it is not recharged, approximately $5 \%$ (depends on battery) of its capacity is discharged per month. While batteries are stored in warehouse, it is recommended that they are charged once a month to maintain lifetime.

\section*{ELECTROLYTE}

Lead-acid battery uses diluted sulfuric acid as electrolyte. However, sulfuric acid does not evaporate. If diluted sulfuric acid is spilled, it becomes concentrated sulfuric acid after the water has evaporated. Sulfuric acid damages cloths, floor, skin and eyes.

When acid is spilled, it is not enough to wipe out the acid just once because some residue always remains. Wipe at least five times. The best solution is to neutralize the acid using soda ash as a neutralizer since it is easily available.

When electrolyte level is low, add distilled water. Do not add too much distilled water than the indicated level. Some technicians still believe that higher electrolyte level increase the capacity of the battery. This is not true. Excess water reduces the specific gravity and reduces battery efficiency and causes a mess through spillage.

Never add tap water because it contains impurity and it will kill the battery.
Never add sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid does not evaporate; therefore, top-up is not necessary.

\section*{EQUALIZATION}

A 12 V battery uses 6 cells. After several operation cycles, each unit cell will have a different voltage level. For longer battery life, it is recommended that voltage of each unit cell be equalized once a month. To equalize, full charge above 14.5 V is necessary.

However, SHS uses charge controller to control charge and discharge level but this depends on the charge controller which you use. Some charge controllers have this function and others do not.

\section*{STRATIFICATION OF ELECTROLYTE}

Stratification occurs when electrolyte in flooded-cells separates into layers, with the heavier electrolyte 'sinking' to the bottom of the cell and the lower density electrolyte floating to the top of the cell. Not only does this give false hydrometer readings, it also decreases the performance of the cell. Avoid stratification by occasionally giving an equalizing charge to the battery - the intense bubbling of equalization mixes up the acid.

Another way is to simply shake a battery once a week. To shake a battery, lift it up to approximately 3 cm on one side of the battery and then down it. Repeat the action 10 times.

Do not lift up the battery too high otherwise electrolyte will spill out.

\section*{TYPE OF LEAD -ACID BATTERY}

There are two categories of battery types. One is type of structure, the other is depth of discharge.

\section*{TYPE OF MAINTENANCE}

\section*{Refill type}

Refill type batteries need top up of distilled water to maintain electrolyte level. This type of battery is easily available so that often used for SHS. However, most of the failure of SHS is caused by this type of batteries. Electrolyte is easily dried up or tap water is added to the electrolyte.

\section*{Maintenance free type}

Maintenance free type batteries do not require top up of distilled water. This has been designed to convert produced gas into water to recycle and there is a large reservoir of electrolyte. If overcharged, however, it produces too much gas resulting in the damage of battery.

\section*{TYPE OF CYCLE (DEPTH OF DISCHARGE)}

\section*{Automotive type}

This type is very common and always available easily. This type is designed to withdraw large amount of current in seconds to start an engine. Therefore, this type of battery is not suitable for continuous discharge. Maximum depth of discharge is approximately $50 \%$.

\section*{Deep cycle type}

This type is designed for continuous discharging. Good for SHS use. Maximum depth of discharge is approximately $80 \%$.

\section*{TYPE OF ELECTROLYTE}

\section*{Flooded type}

This type uses liquid electrolyte.

\section*{Gel type}

This type uses gel electrolyte. The battery is completely sealed.

\section*{CAPACITY}

\section*{RATINGS}

Battery capacity is normally shown as Ampere-hour (Ah). This means available current for certain hours is obtained by dividing current. For example, 100Ah means 5A is discharged for 20 hours. (100Ah / 5A = 20h)

\section*{DEPTH OF DISCHARGE (DOD)}

A battery's capacity cannot be all used. If a battery has capacity of 100 Ah , it stores 100 Ah . However, this battery cannot deliver 100Ah. The amount of power available for discharge depends on the battery type. This is called the depth of discharge.

Automotive battery can discharge $50 \%$. Deep cycle battery can discharge $80 \%$.

\section*{AMPERE-HOUR EFFICIENCY}

When 50Ah battery is fully charged, it is expected that the same amount of 50Ah can be discharged within depth of discharge. If efficiency is $100 \%$, it is possible. Unfortunately, there are no 100\% efficient batteries. Energy is consumed or lost as a result of gas formation and heat generation during charging.

Efficiency is around $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ depending on quality of battery, type of battery, life stage and charge/discharge rate.

\section*{LIFETIME}

The lifetime of a battery is a constrain on a SHS. The lifetime of a battery is shorter than other components of SHS, therefore, users must save money to replace a battery every 3 to 5 years. There are several factors that determine the lifetime of a battery and includes.
1. Cycling ability
2. Temperature
3. Quality of battery
4. Performance of charge controller

\section*{CONNECTIONS TO OTHER BATTERIES}

A battery can be connected to other batteries if all of them are the same (type, model, age). Wire size should be 6 mm 2 or more and wire length must be shortened as much as possible.

By parallel connection, voltage is the same and capacity is the sum of the battery capacities.
By series connection, voltage is the sum of battery voltage and capacity is the same.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-30.jpg?height=806&width=1231&top_left_y=619&top_left_x=284)

\section*{CHOOSING THE BEST BATTERY}

When choosing your battery take the following things into consideration:
1. Price. At the end of the day, a decision must be made on the cost of equipment. Some very good batteries are available for high prices - the buyer must decide what is important based on the particular needs of the system. On the other hand, many small household solar PV systems in Africa and
2. Capacity. Choosing the right size battery for your needs is important.
3. Cycle life. In general, the better the battery, the longer the cycle life. Remember that batteries with lead-calcium plates have a lower tolerance for deep discharges. If your system is likely to be deeply discharged regularly choose lead-antimony plates instead.
4. Replacement and availability. It is wise to choose a battery that is locally available. When the time comes to replace the set, it is more likely that you will be able to find a similar type. Shipping batteries across the world is expensive, time-consuming and energy intensive.
5. Maintenance. Choose a battery that meets your maintenance needs and capabilities. If batteries are unlikely to be maintained, consider spending a little bit more on 'maintenance-free' units. Remember, no battery is truly 'maintenance free' because the system must be managed or it will not work well!
6. Size. Be aware of the physical size of the battery and where it is going to be placed. Make sure you use a safe area to enclose or house it.
7. Mobility. If your battery is going to be moved around (not recommended but sometimes necessary) choose a type that will not be damaged by vibration and tilting.

\section*{Tasks involved in maintaining and managing batteries include:}
- Regular checking of state of charge to ensure that the battery is performing well; keeping state of charge records may help to detect when a battery is getting too old to use or when a cell has gone bad.
- For flooded-cell batteries, checking electrolyte levels in each cell; replacing electrolyte lost during gassing with de-ionized water. The plates should always be below the level of the electrolyte to avoid damage to the battery. De-ionized water, available at battery shops and garages, is used instead of tap water because it does not contain any impurities that could damage the cells. Never add tap water or acid to batteries.
- Cleaning the top of the battery. This avoids high rates of self-discharge caused by electrical conduction through acid mist accumulating on top of the battery.
- Cleaning terminals and contacts. Cleaning the terminals ensures a good electrical contact with the solar array and load. Application of petroleum jelly or grease to the terminals prevents them from becoming corroded.
- Giving the battery equalizing charges to mix up the electrolyte four to six times a year. Equalizing charges are charges well above the normal 'full' charge which cause the electrolyte in the cells to bubble and get mixed up and reduce risk of stratification or sulphation. Preferably, these charges should be done in the cloudy season or when the solar radiation is low.

\section*{CHOOSING THE BATTERY LOCATION}

Batteries should be located in a cool, vented room. Here are some general guidelines for locating and installing the batteries.
- Nearness to array: batteries should be located as close as possible to the array to reduce voltage drop. The cable is generally sized large enough to carry the charge current from the module with 2 per cent or less voltage drop.
- Ventilation: the battery room must have some sort of opening for air to enter and leave. Batteries emit explosive gases when charging and this must be allowed to escape. Place a 'No Smoking or Naked Flames' sign in the room where the batteries are located.
- Accessibility: batteries should be accessible for easy state-of-charge measurement and cleaning, but only to authorized persons.
- Temperature: batteries should be located in a cool place. If battery temperature gets above $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, its lifetime and performance will be reduced. Never place a battery where it will be exposed to the sun.
- Battery boxes: batteries should not be placed directly on the floor as moisture or accidental puddles can increase their self-discharge rates. They should be kept in a vented box to prevent children and animals from injuring themselves and to prevent accidental short circuits
- Security and safety: locate batteries where they are secure and not likely to be stolen. A closet or room where children and animals cannot tamper with it might be suitable for a battery box containing two batteries. Battery boxes or rooms should be locked, but always ensuring that the key is nearby for quick access.

\section*{SAFETY}

A lead-acid battery contains sulfuric acid and produce gas during charging. When shortcircuited, a battery discharges huge amount of current and a wire will melt down or cause fire. For safety, you must follow these items.
- Store in cool place.
- Ensure enough airflow to release a gas.
- Avoid short circuit.
- Do not touch acid. If acid contacts skins, eyes, wash with plenty of water
- immediately.
- Place in a battery box and keep away from children.

\section*{MAINTENANCE OF A BATTERY}

Batteries usually cause the most troubles in SHS, hence the use of maintenance free battery is strongly recommended. In the case where a refill type battery is used,
- Check electrolyte level once a month.
- If electrolyte level is low, add distilled water.
- Do NOT add too much distilled water.
- Do NOT add tap water. If tap water is added, the battery will be damaged.
- Check specific gravity of each unit cell periodically. When specific gravity of each unit cell becomes vary, do equalization. In the case where a flooded type battery is used,
- Shake battery once a week to mix electrolyte.

\section*{COMMON PROBLEMS}

Most failures of a SHS are related to batteries as shown below.
- Poor quality of battery. (Short lifetime)
- Lack of maintenance for refill battery: Drying up of electrolyte. Addition of tap water. Addition of too much distilled water.
- Capacity of a battery is too big as compared to PV module size.
- Stratification of electrolyte reduces capacity and lifetime.
- Corrosion caused by sulfuric acid.
- Dumping of dead battery. (Lead is hazardous)

\section*{Do NOT expect:}
- Users to buy distilled water.
- Users to maintain electrolyte level properly.
- Users not to add tap water.

\section*{CHARGE CONTROLLER}
'charge controllers' which are devices used to manage the energy flow in solar electric systems. Solar electric systems use charge controllers (also called charge regulators) to manage the electrical power produced by the modules, to protect the batteries and to act as a connection point for all the system components (in systems without inverters).

The charge controller has a number of primary functions. Firstly, it provides a central point for connecting the load, the module and the battery.

Secondly, it manages the system so that the optimum charge is provided to the batteries.
Thirdly, it ensures that components (especially batteries and lights) are protected from damage due to overcharge, deep discharge and changing voltage levels.

Finally, it enables the end-user to monitor the system and identify potential system problems.

TYPES OF CHARGE CONTROLLERS
1. Series type controllers
2. Shunt type controllers
3. PWM controllers
4. MTTP controllers

SERIES TYPE CHARGE CONTROLLERS
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_12_735dd22c22905b8a4f0ag-34.jpg?height=835&width=1557&top_left_y=1764&top_left_x=255)

Series-type controllers rely on relays or electronic switches in series between the module and the battery to disconnect the module when the battery reaches a set voltage. When the battery state of charge goes down after the load is used, the controller resets the charger to turn 'on' during the next solar cycle. The simplest and lowest cost controllers, these are less common in modern PV systems.

\section*{Over charge protection}

PV module is connected to charge a battery (Switch (1) is on) When battery voltage reaches at maximum charging voltage, called HVD (High Voltage Disconnect), PV module is disconnected to avoid further charging (Switch (1) is off). When battery voltage reduced to certain voltage, called HVR (High voltage Reconnect), after disconnection of the PV module, the PV module is connected again to start charging (Switch (1) is on again).

\section*{Over discharge protection}

The load is connected to use appliances (Switch (2) is on). When the battery voltage reaches a minimum discharging voltage, called LVD (Low Voltage Disconnect), load is disconnected to avoid over discharge (Switch (2) is off).

When the battery voltage is recovered at a certain voltage, called LVR (Low Voltage Reconnect), load is reconnected again and the appliances can be used again (Switch (2) is on again).

\section*{SHUNT TYPE CONTROLLERS}

Shunt-type controllers work in parallel between the array and battery. They gradually reduce power from the module to the battery as the battery reaches full charge, harmlessly shortcircuiting it back through the module. In general, shunt-type controllers are low cost, fairly simple in design and well suited for small off-grid PV systems.

'Pulse-width modulation (PWM) controllers' send pulses of charge to the battery that vary depending on its state of charge. A battery with a low state of charge gets a 'wide' pulse (i.e. high charge) or the charge is on continuously. As the battery gets fully charged, the controller sends increasingly 'narrow' pulses of charge. A fully charged battery (in 'float' mode) just gets an occasional narrow pulse. The controller measures the state of charge and adjusts the pulse accordingly. (Both PWM and MPPT controllers use features of the series- or shunt-type controllers.)

PWM regulators are similar to series regulators, but they use a transistor instead of a relay to open the array. By switching the transistor at high frequency with various modulated widths, a constant voltage can be maintained. The PWM regulator self-adjusts by varying the widths (lengths) and speed of the pulses sent to the battery. Unlike the on/off charge controllers which instantaneously cut off the power transfer to minimize battery overcharging, PWM regulators act like a rapid on/off controller constantly.

When the width is at $100 \%$, the transistor is at full ON, allowing the solar array to bulk charge the battery. When the width is at $0 \%$ the transistor is OFF, open circuiting the array preventing any current from flowing to the battery when the battery is fully charged.

Like the series regulator, the transistor can be placed in either the positive or negative line, allowing the regulator to be used in positive and negative ground systems. The difference between the series regulator and the PWM regulator is the PWM of the transistor. When the modulation width is at $100 \%$ or $0 \%$, the regulator is essentially a series regulator, it is that modulation width variation that allows the PWM regulator to create a constant voltage to the battery as opposed to the on/off of the series regulator. The below figure shows an example of a PWM regulator regulating with a $70 \%$ on $30 \%$ off duty cycle.

\section*{MAXIMUM POWER POINT TRACKERS'}
'Maximum power point trackers' (MPPT) utilize DC to DC conversion electronics to 'track' the maximum power point of the module or array I-V curve.

The maximum power point voltage of a module is often much higher than its battery-charging voltage, meaning that a 100 Wp module might only be charging a battery at 75 Wp at 14 V (i.e. the charging voltage) - the maximum power point might be 16 V . By keeping the charge voltage at the maximum power point, MPPT controllers gain an extra 10-35 per cent output from the array. MPPT trackers also can accept higher voltages from the module, meaning that they are able to use modules with a higher voltage (i.e. 24 V or higher) and convert the power to 12 V (or the rated battery voltage). MPPTs tend mostly to be used in large systems, where getting the most out of the array results in significant cost gains for the system.

\section*{CHECKING THE STATUS OF A CHARGE CONTROLLER}

When checking the system, it is important to know the status of the charge controller to determine whether the PV module is connected or the load is disconnected. It is easy to check if the load is connected or not to the charge controller. You can do this simply by switching on a light and if the light comes on, the load is connected. If it does not it follows that the load is disconnected. Some charge controllers have a function that displays the disconnection of load.

The following tips will help you to check the status of a PV module connection. The status of a PV connection can be assessed by measuring the voltage at all loads off between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on a sunny day,
A. When a PV module is connected.
- The battery voltage increases.
- Charging current can be observed using clamp meter or shunt resistance.
B. When a PV module is disconnected.
- The battery voltage does not increase.
- When one light is switched on, the voltage starts to decrease till HVR.
- When the voltage reaches HVR, it starts to increase (A').

\section*{CONNECTING ORDER}

A charge controller is connected to a PV module, a battery and a load. As a PV module generates high voltage (approximately 18 V ), connecting order to a charge controller is important. First, connect the battery to activate the charge controller and stabilize voltage. Second, connect the PV module, and then the load. To disconnect, disconnect the load first, then the PV module, and last is the battery.

Use this as the rule of the thumb, "First battery, Last battery "If a battery is disconnected before disconnecting the PV module, a high voltage from PV module will go directly to the load causing damage to appliances.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Connection & & Disconnection \\
\hline 1 & Battery & 3 & Battery \\
\hline 2 & PV Module & 2 & PV Modu \\
\hline 3 & Load & 1 & Load \\
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{First Battery, Last Battery} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

MAINTENANCE OF CHARGE CONTROLLERS
Insects may cause problems. Check presence of insects, especially ants, to see if they are not nesting inside a charge controller. A poor charge controller suffers from drifts of the set point voltage. It is important to check the set point voltage periodically.

\section*{COMMON PROBLEMS}

The drifting of the set point voltage damages the battery.
Misconnection and short-circuiting cause burnout.
Malfunction. --- Use good brand.

\section*{SOLAR SYSTEM DESIGN}

What is solar PV system?

Solar photovoltaic system or Solar power system is one of renewable energy system which uses PV modules to convert sunlight into electricity. The electricity generated can be either stored or used directly, fed back into grid line or combined with one or more other electricity generators or more renewable energy source. Solar PV system is very reliable and clean source of electricity that can suit a wide range of applications such as residence, industry, agriculture, livestock, etc.

\section*{MAJOR SYSTEM COMPONENTS}

Solar PV system includes different components that should be selected according to your system type, site location and applications. The major components for solar PV system are solar charge controller, inverter, battery bank, auxiliary energy sources and loads (appliances).

PV module - converts sunlight into DC electricity.
Solar charge controller - regulates the voltage and current coming from the PV panels going to battery and prevents battery overcharging and prolongs the battery life.

Inverter - converts DC output of PV panels or wind turbine into a clean AC current for AC appliances or fed back into grid line.

Battery - stores energy for supplying to electrical appliances when there is a demand.
Load - is electrical appliances that connected to solar PV system such as lights, radio, TV, computer, refrigerator, etc.

Auxiliary energy sources - is diesel generator or other renewable energy sources.

\section*{SOLAR PV SYSTEM SIZING}
1. DETERMINE POWER CONSUMPTION DEMANDS
the first step in designing a solar PV system is to find out the total power and energy consumption of all loads that need to be supplied by the solar PV system as follows:
a. Calculate total Watt-hours per day for each appliance used. Add the Watt-hours needed for all appliances together to get the total Watt-hours per day which must be delivered to the appliances.
b. Calculate total Watt-hours per day needed from the PV modules. Multiply the total appliances Watt-hours per day times 1.3 (the energy lost in the system) to get the total Watt-hours per day which must be provided by the panels.

\section*{2. SIZE THE PV MODULES}

Different size of PV modules will produce different amount of power. To find out the sizing of PV module, the total peak watt produced needs. The peak watt (Wp) produced depends on size of the PV module and climate of site location. We have to consider "panel generation factor" which is different in each site location. For Thailand, the panel generation factor is 3.43 . To determine the sizing of PV modules, calculate as follows:
a. Calculate the total Watt-peak rating needed for PV modules

Divide the total Watt-hours per day needed from the PV modules (from item 1b) by 3.43 to get the total Watt-peak rating needed for the PV panels needed to operate the appliances.
b. Calculate the number of PV panels for the system

Calculate the number of PV panels for the system Divide the answer obtained in item 2a by the rated output Watt-peak of the PV modules available to you. Increase any fractional part of result to the next highest full number and that will be the number of PV modules required.

Result of the calculation is the minimum number of PV panels. If more PV modules are installed, the system will perform better and battery life will be improved. If fewer PV modules are used, the system may not work at all during cloudy periods and battery life will be shortened.

\section*{3. INVERTER SIZING}

An inverter is used in the system where AC power output is needed. The input rating of the inverter should never be lower than the total watt of appliances. The inverter must have the same nominal voltage as your battery. For stand-alone systems, the inverter must be large enough to handle the total amount of Watts you will be using at one time. The inverter size should be $25-30 \%$ bigger than total Watts of appliances. In case of appliance type is motor or compressor then inverter size should be minimum 3 times the capacity of those appliances and must be added to the inverter capacity to handle surge current during starting. For grid tie systems or grid connected systems, the input rating of the inverter should be same as PV array rating to allow for safe and efficient operation.

\section*{4. BATTERY SIZING}

The battery type recommended for using in solar PV system is deep cycle battery. Deep cycle battery is specifically designed for to be discharged to low energy level and rapid recharged or cycle charged and discharged day after day for years. The battery should be large enough to store sufficient energy to operate the appliances at night and cloudy days. To find out the size of battery, calculate as follows:
a. Calculate total Watt-hours per day used by appliances.
b. Divide the total Watt-hours per day used by 0.85 for battery loss.
c. Divide the answer obtained in item 4 b by 0.6 for depth of discharge.
d. Divide the answer obtained in item 4 c by the nominal battery voltage.
e. Multiply the answer obtained in item 4 d with days of autonomy (the number of days that you need the system to operate when there is no power produced by PV panels) to get the required Ampere-hour capacity of deep-cycle battery
Battery Capacity $(\mathrm{Ah})=($ Total Watt-hours per day used by appliances x Days of autonomy)/ ((0.85 x $0.6 \times$ nominal battery voltage))

\section*{5. SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER SIZING}

The solar charge controller is typically rated against Amperage and Voltage capacities. Select the solar charge controller to match the voltage of PV array and batteries and then identify which type of solar charge controller is right for your application.

Make sure that solar charge controller has enough capacity to handle the current from PV array. For the series charge controller type, the sizing of controller depends on the total PV input current which is delivered to the controller and also depends on PV panel configuration (series or parallel configuration).

According to standard practice, the sizing of solar charge controller is to take the short circuit current (Isc) of the PV array, and multiply it by 1.3

Solar charge controller rating $=$ Total short circuit current of PV array $\times 1.3$

Remark: For MPPT charge controller sizing will be different.

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A house has the following electrical appliance usage:
- One 18-Watt fluorescent lamp with electronic ballast used 4 hours per day.
- One 60-Watt fan used for 2 hours per day.
- One 75-Watt refrigerator that runs 24 hours per day with compressor run 12 hours and off 12 hours.

The system will be powered by $12 \mathrm{Vdc}, 110 \mathrm{Wp}$ PV module.
Determine power consumption demands
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Appliance & Quantity & Wattage & Hours/day & Watt-hours/day \\
\hline Fluorescent lamp & 1 & 18 & 4 & 72 \\
\hline Fan & 1 & 60 & 2 & 120 \\
\hline Fridge & 1 & 75 & 12 & 900 \\
\hline Total & & & & $1092 \mathrm{~Wh} /$ day \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Total PV panels energy needed $=1,092 \times 1.3$
= 1,419.6 Wh/day.

\section*{SIZE THE PV PANEL}
\begin{tabular}{rl} 
2.1 Total Wp of PV panel capacity & $=1,419.6 / 3.4$ \\
needed & $=413.9 \mathrm{Wp}$ \\
2.2 Number of PV panels needed & $=413.9 / 110$ \\
& $=3.76$ modules
\end{tabular}

Actual requirement $=4$ modules
So, this system should be powered by at least 4 modules of 110 Wp PV module.

\section*{INVERTER SIZING}

Total Watt of all appliances $=18+60+75=153 \mathrm{~W}$
For safety, the inverter should be considered $25-30 \%$ bigger size.
The inverter size should be about 190 W or greater.

\section*{BATTERY SIZE}

Total appliances use $=(18 \mathrm{~W} \times 4$ hours $)+(60 \mathrm{~W} \times 2$ hours $)+(75 \mathrm{~W} \times 12$ hours $)$
Nominal battery voltage $=12 \mathrm{~V}$
Days of autonomy $=3$ days
Battery capacity $=\frac{[(18 \mathrm{~W} \times 4 \text { hours })+(60 \mathrm{~W} \times 2 \text { hours })+(75 \mathrm{~W} \times 12 \text { hours })]}{(0.85 \times 0.6 \times 12)} \times 3$
Total Ampere-hours required 535.29 Ah
So the battery should be rated 12 V 600 Ah for 3 day autonomy.

\section*{SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER SIZING}
```
PV module specification
Pm = 110 Wp
Vm = 16.7 Vdc
lm = 6.6 A
Voc = 20.7 A
Isc = 7.5 A
Solar charge controller rating = (4 strings x 7.5 A) x 1.3 = 39 A
So the solar charge controller should be rated 40 A at 12 V or greater.
```

\section*{SIZING FUSES AND CIRCUIT BREAKERS}

List the circuits that need to be protected
Divide the power by system voltage to get current in amps. This is the maximum rated current in the circuit

Increase this figure by 20 per cent of its value (i.e. multiply this figure by 1.2). This is the size of the fuse required.

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A 12 V system circuit includes a 60 W television and three 10 W lamps:
$$60 W+10 W+10 W+10 W=90 W$$

Divide the power by the system voltage $(12 \mathrm{~V})$ :
$$90 \mathrm{~W} / 12 \mathrm{~V}=7.5 \mathrm{~A}$$

This is the maximum current coming from the battery to the charge controller. Increase this figure by 20 per cent:
$$7.5 \mathrm{~A} \times 1.2=9 \mathrm{~A}$$

In the above circuit example, a 9-amp fuse should be used. Since this size does not exist, select the next largest size, in this case a 10 -amp fuse. The current rating of the cable needs to be greater than 10 amps.

\section*{WIRE SIZE, VOLTAGE DROP}

Voltage drop is the loss of voltage (and hence power) due to resistance in long cable runs. If the wire's cross-section area is too small for a given current, an unacceptable voltage drop will occur over its length. Resistance in the cable converts electrical energy to heat and causes a consequent voltage drop. When the voltage drop is too large in, for example, the cables from the PV module or array, the battery or battery bank will not be charged properly; in distribution circuits it will affect performance of lamps and appliances, and may damage them. The voltage drop also wastes expensive energy from the PV array and battery.

Voltage drop occurs in all wire runs. However, voltage drops of more than 5 per cent are always unacceptable. Correctly selected cable sizes will avoid unacceptable voltage drops.

Voltage Drop (volts) $=$ Current $($ I: amps $) \times$ Resistance $($ R: ohms $)$
To calculate voltage drop, one must first know three values:
- the current flow through the wire in amps (I);
- the distance of the cable run in meters (the length of both the positive and negative runs must be included in this calculation!); and
- the resistance factor, K , of the intended cable in ohms per meter.

\section*{EXAMPLE 3}

Suppose electricity is provided for a 24 W lamp in a kitchen 50 m ( 165 feet) from the power source using 2.5 mm 2 cable. Using Ohm's Law, it is possible to calculate the voltage drop for a 12 V DC and 24 V DC system.

For a 12 -volt system the current is 2 amps and for a 24 -volt system it is 1 amp .
1. The resistance factor of the 2.5 mm 2 cable, from Table 7.1 a , is $0.0074 \Omega /$ meter.
2. The total resistance of the wire is calculated by multiplying the resistance factor by the length of the wire. Note that the number is equal for both the 12 and 24 V DC system because the wire is the same in each case. Use 100 m (i.e. $2 \times 50 \mathrm{~m}$ ) for the calculation because it is a two-way run. The total resistance over the wire run is $0.74 \Omega(0.0074 \Omega$ per meter $\times 100 \mathrm{~m}$ ).
3. Next, as per Ohm's Law, the total resistance is multiplied by the current carried in the wire. This gives the voltage drop.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Table 7.1a Copper cable size and resistance (metric sizes)} \\
\hline Cable Size & Resistance in ohms per metre ( $\Omega / \mathrm{m}$ ) \\

\section*{SOLUTION}

Table 7.7 Example of calculation of voltage drop in 12 and 24V DC systems
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Voltage Drop in a $2.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ cable & 12 V DC lamp & 24 V DC lamp \\
\hline Current (amps) & 2.0A & 1.0A \\
\hline Length of Wire (m) & 100 m & 100 m \\
\hline Resistance Factor, K ( $2.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ cable) & $0.0074 \Omega / \mathrm{m}$ & $0.0074 \Omega / \mathrm{m}$ \\
\hline Total Resistance ( $\mathrm{K} \times 100 \mathrm{~m}$ ) & $0.74 \Omega$ & $0.74 \Omega$ \\
\hline Voltage Drop (Total resistance $\times$ amps) & 1.48 V & 0.74 V \\
\hline Voltage at Lamp & 10.52 V & 23.26 V \\
\hline Per cent Voltage Drop & 12.3\% & 3.1\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For the 12 V lamp, the voltage drop is 12.3 per cent. This drop is too high and a larger diameter wire size
needs to be used. With a 24 V lamp, the voltage drop is only 3.1 per cent. This example demonstrates
why 50 m ( 165 foot) cable runs in small solar electric systems are problematic.

\section*{WIRE SIZE AND DISTANCE}

To avoid voltage, drop larger than $5 \%$ the following sizes of wire and distance to components should be used. The distance shown is the maximum distance allowed between components for each wire.

\section*{WIRING SYSTEMS}

A wiring system is an assembly of parts used in the formation of one or more electrical circuits. It consists of the conductor, together with its insulation, its protection against mechanical damage (sheathing and or armoring), certain wiring accessories for fixing the system, and joining and terminating the conductors.

\section*{TYPES OF WIRING SYSTEMS}
1. Sheathed wiring
2. Conduit wiring

\section*{SHEATHED WIRING}

This type of system consists of the conductors (cables) together with its insulation, its protection against mechanical damage (sheathing or armoring).

In sheathed wiring systems this method of wiring consists of an insulated conductor with a sheath which serves to some degree as a measure of protection against mechanical damage.

Types of sheathed wiring
1. Tough rubber sheath
2. Polyvinylchloride sheathed (PVC sheathed)
3. Polychloroprene sheathed (PCP sheathed)
4. Paper insulated lead covered sheath

TOUGH RUBBER SHEATH
This system is termed as an all insulated system because the sheath is an insulating material. The insulation is vulcanized rubber and the sheath is tough rubber.

\section*{POLYVINYLCHLORIDE SHEATHED (PVC SHEATHED)}

This system is also insulated. the conductors are insulated with PVC and the sheath is PVC. Much inferior to rubber but has the advantage in that it's less affected by oil.

\section*{POLYCHLOROPRENE SHEATHED (PCP SHEATHED)}

This plastic material was formed because neither P.V.C nor rubber was quite suitable for farm wiring where steam, lactic acid, and milk fats are present. The cable consists of conductors insulated with vulcanized rubber and sheathed with PCP.

\section*{PAPER INSULATED, LEAD SHEATHED}

These cables are normally used for external underground distribution systems and internal distribution in factories and internal distribution systems. The paper is hygroscopic and must therefore be protected against the ingress of moisture by the use of cable sealing boxes.

Further protection against mechanical damage is provided by steel wire or tape

\section*{CONDUIT WIRING}

The types of conduits commonly used are steel conduits and PVC conduits
It is important to note cables are drawn in after the conduits have been erected.

\section*{STEEL CONDUITS}

Annealed mild steel tubing is very widely used for enclosing insulated cables. The conduit is normally annealed so that it may be bent or set to any angle without breaking. They are of two types
a. Light gauge - made of lighter mild steel and can be easily bent into angles and shapes
b. Heavy gauge - made of heavier (thicker) materials than light gauge. this is normally used for H.V cables.

\section*{PVC CONDUIT}

The conduits are made of plastic (p.v.c). we have two types
a. Heavy gauge (with red label indicated on the conduits)- recommended for most installations
b. Light gauge (not recommended)

The conduits are bend into angles and shapes by use of a bending spring.
The conduits should not be installed on hot surfaces

\section*{FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN SELECTION OF A WIRING SYSTEM}

Before any electrical installation is begun, some careful consideration must be given to the factors or conditions which decide the type of wiring systems, its associated accessories, etc. to be installed. The factors include; -
1. The type of building - whether the wiring system is for a permanent building or a temporary building or the extension to an existing building.
2. Flexibility - whether the installation system must be one that will allow it to be extended or altered at some point in the future.
3. Installation conditions - whether the installation is likely to be subjected to mechanical damage, moisture, fumes weather, abnormal conditions, flammable gas, etc.
4. Appearance - whether the building is such that the electrical installation must be hidden or its appearance can be allowed.
5. Durability - whether the installation is to last for the time of the life of the building or not.
6. Cost. Whether the amount of money available for the electrical installation is restricted or not.
7. Safety. this is an extremely important aspect. the system must be safe for all i.e. from the point of view of supply and the earthing systems

\section*{TESTING AND FINAL CONNECTIONS}

Before making final connections, carry out the following electrical tests on the system. These electrical pre-checks will ensure safety, efficiency, and proper operation. No electrical cables or system should be energized before it has been tested.
1. Solar PV system tests
2. Electrical tests

\section*{SOLAR PV SYSTEM TESTS}
1. Array: check the module/array's open-circuit voltage. Verify correct polarity/color-coding of the cables coming into the building (with a multimeter set on the DC volt scale), and verify it short-circuit current (with the multimeter set on the $0-10 \mathrm{DC}$ amp scale).
2. Array-battery voltage drop: check the voltage drop between the module(s) and the battery Full sun and a substantial current flowing into the batteries are required for this test. A voltage drops of more than 2 percent between the array and battery is unacceptable (some types of charge controllers reduce the voltage so consider this).
3. Battery: check the battery voltage, DC polarity, and fuse with a multimeter.

\section*{ELECTRICAL TESTS}
1. Verification of polarity
2. Test of the effectiveness of earthing
3. Insulation resistance
4. Test of ring circuit continuity

\section*{FINAL CONNECTIONS}

After conducting all necessary wiring tests and a comprehensive visual inspection of the installation the final connection sequence can be carried out. The order presented below is only a suggested sequence.
1. Connect the wires from the battery to the charge controller-
2. Connect the load and check load polarity
3. Connect the solar cell module(s)- First, turn all the lamps and sockets off using the main switches in the controller (if there are none, turn them off at the room switches). The two main cables ( + and - ) coming from the PV array will then be either connected to the charge controller (in a small one- or two-module system) or to an isolator/disconnect which feeds into the charge controller.
4. Final visual inspection- Check to see that all the lights and sockets are in working order (plug an appliance into each socket to test it). Using a voltmeter, check for voltage drop at the farthest point from the batteries. Check the LED readings on the charge controller. The system wiring is complete, and it can now be safely commissioned and used. Remember, batteries should be fully charged before the system is utilized.

\section*{MAINTENANCE OF PV SYSTEMS}

A properly installed solar electric system requires relatively little maintenance. The work involved in maintaining a solar electric system is much less than that needed to maintain a diesel- or petrol-powered generator. The best maintenance practice is to make regular inspections of the equipment (especially batteries and modules), to make sure things are kept clean, and to make sure all electrical contacts are tight.

Important PV system information includes:
- Circuit diagrams and maps showing the location of batteries, loads, wire runs, junction boxes, and buried cables.
- The system completion, inspection, and test certificate.
- System design worksheets, plans, and specifications.
- Manuals, warranties, and manufacturers' specifications for system components.
- The system logbook. This contains records of battery state of charge and history, installation
