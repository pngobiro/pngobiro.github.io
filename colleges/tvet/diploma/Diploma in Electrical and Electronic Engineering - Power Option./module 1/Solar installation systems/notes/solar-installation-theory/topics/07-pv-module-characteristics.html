                        <p>I-V curves are used to compare solar cell modules and to predict their performance at various temperatures, voltage loads and levels of insolation. Each solar cell and module has its own particular set of operating characteristics. At a given voltage, a module (or cell) will produce a certain current. These properties are described by the current-voltage curve, better known as the I-V curve.</p>
                        <p>Figure shows an I-V curve for a module rated at 42 Wp at STC. The left-hand side (I) gives the current the module produces depending on voltage. The bottom side gives the voltage produced by the module at various currents. At each point along the line, you can determine the power of the module by multiplying the current by the voltage. For example, imagine a battery being charged by a module: at 12 volts (Point A, Figure 3.4), the current from the module is 3.2 amps and the power output is 38.4 watts (amps $\times$ volts $=$ power, so $12 \mathrm{~V} \times 3.2 \mathrm{~A}=38.4 \mathrm{~W}$, which is less than the rated 42 Wp ).</p>

The maximum power point is always found at the place where the curve begins to bend steeply downward ('the knee', Point D). It is advisable to operate a module as near to the maximum power point as possible.
