                                <p><strong>(a) Mainframe Computer vs. Computer Network</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Distinction:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Mainframe Computer:</strong> A single, very large, powerful, and expensive computer designed for high-volume, centralized data processing, supporting thousands of users concurrently through terminals (historically) or network connections. It emphasizes high reliability, massive throughput, and centralized control, often running specialized operating systems. All processing power resides in the central unit.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Computer Network:</strong> A collection of multiple, often smaller, independent computers (like PCs, servers) and devices interconnected to communicate and share resources (data, printers, internet access). Processing power is distributed among the connected computers (client-server or peer-to-peer models). Resources are shared, but individual computers retain their own processing capabilities.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Reasons for Popularity of Computer Networks (over relying solely on Mainframes):</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Building networks using relatively inexpensive personal computers and servers is often significantly cheaper than purchasing and maintaining a mainframe, especially for smaller organizations or specific departmental needs.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Flexibility and Scalability:</strong> Networks allow for easier and more flexible growth. Adding more computers or resources to a network is generally simpler and more incremental than scaling up a mainframe. Distributed processing offers more configuration flexibility.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Networks excel at allowing users on standard PCs to share files, printers, internet access, and applications easily across the organization.</li>
                                            <li><strong>User Empowerment:</strong> Provides users with individual computing power on their desktops while still allowing access to shared resources, offering more autonomy than traditional mainframe terminal access.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Keyboard Key Functions</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Tab Key:</strong> In text editing, moves the cursor to the next predefined tab stop, used for indentation or aligning text. In forms or dialog boxes, it typically moves the focus to the next field or control element.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Esc (Escape) Key:</strong> Used to cancel an operation, close a dialog box or menu, exit a mode (like full-screen), or generate an escape code in certain programming contexts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(iii) Backspace Key:</strong> Deletes the character immediately to the left of the cursor or deletes the currently selected text/object.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Utility Programs Forming Part of a Programming Language (Toolchain)</strong></p>
                                <p class="key-point">Programming languages themselves don't usually *contain* utility programs, but their implementation often relies on a toolchain that includes such utilities.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Compiler/Interpreter:</strong> Translates source code written in the programming language into machine-executable code or intermediate code. (System software, not strictly a utility, but essential).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Linker:</strong> Combines compiled object code modules (from the compiler) with necessary library routines to create a final executable program. *(Utility)*</li>
                                    <li><strong>Loader:</strong> Loads the executable program from storage into memory for execution. *(OS Utility)*</li>
                                    <li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Helps programmers find and fix errors (bugs) in their code by allowing step-by-step execution, inspection of variables, and setting breakpoints. *(Development Utility)*</li>
                                    <li><strong>Editor:</strong> A text editor used to write and modify the source code. *(Can be a general utility or part of an Integrated Development Environment - IDE)*</li>
                                    <li><strong>Make Utility / Build System:</strong> Automates the process of compiling and linking multi-file projects. *(Development Utility)*</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Given the low mark, perhaps only Linker, Loader, Debugger were expected as utilities associated with the language development process).*

                                <p><strong>(a) Hard Disk Operations Purpose</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Scanning (e.g., ScanDisk/CHKDSK):</strong> To check the hard disk for file system errors (like lost clusters, cross-linked files) and physical surface errors (bad sectors), and attempt to repair or mark them to maintain data integrity and stability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Formatting:</strong> To prepare the hard disk (or a partition) for use by an operating system by erasing existing data and creating a specific file system structure (like NTFS, FAT32) that allows the OS to store and retrieve files.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(iii) Labeling (Volume Label):</strong> To assign a user-friendly name (the volume label) to a disk drive or partition (e.g., "Data", "BackupDrive") to make it easier to identify in the operating system interface, supplementing the drive letter (like D:).</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Reputational Damage and Loss of Trust:</strong> If sensitive customer or employee data is exposed or misused due to lack of privacy controls, it can severely damage the organization's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust, negative publicity, and potential loss of business.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Legal and Financial Penalties:</strong> Failure to comply with data privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA, or local Data Protection Acts) can result in significant fines, lawsuits from affected individuals, and costly legal battles.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identity Theft and Fraud:</strong> Compromised personal data (names, addresses, ID numbers, financial details) can be used by criminals for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious activities targeting the individuals whose data was exposed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Competitive Disadvantage:</strong> Loss of confidential business information (e.g., client lists, strategic plans) due to privacy breaches can provide competitors with an advantage.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>Implement and Monitor Audit Trails/Logs:</strong> Regularly review system logs (access logs, activity logs, security logs) to identify unusual patterns, unauthorized access attempts, suspicious file modifications, or policy violations that might indicate criminal activity. Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools for automated analysis.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Deploy Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</strong> Use IDPS software or hardware to monitor network traffic and system activities for known attack signatures or anomalous behavior indicative of hacking attempts, malware infections, or unauthorized access, and generate alerts for investigation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Conduct periodic internal and external security audits and vulnerability scans to proactively identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications that could be exploited by criminals.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Employee Monitoring (within legal/policy limits):</strong> Monitor employee computer usage (where permitted by policy and law) for activities that violate security policies or indicate potential internal fraud or data theft.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Importance of Using Macros in Spreadsheets</strong></p>
                                <p>A macro is a recorded sequence of actions, commands, or keystrokes that can be replayed automatically to perform a repetitive task.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Automation of Repetitive Tasks:</strong> Macros allow users to automate complex or frequently performed sequences of actions (like formatting reports, importing data, applying complex calculations) with a single click or shortcut key, saving significant time and effort.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency and Productivity:</strong> By automating tasks, macros speed up workflows and allow users to focus on more analytical or value-added activities, boosting overall productivity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consistency and Reduced Errors:</strong> Automating tasks ensures they are performed exactly the same way every time, reducing the potential for human error that can occur with manual repetition and ensuring consistent formatting or calculation results.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Custom Functionality:</strong> Macros (especially those written or edited using VBA - Visual Basic for Applications) can be used to create custom functions, commands, or automated processes tailored to specific user needs that go beyond the standard built-in features of the spreadsheet software.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>(i) Slide Show View:</strong> Appropriate when **delivering the presentation** to an audience. It displays slides full-screen, activates animations and transitions, and hides the editing interface, providing the intended viewing experience.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Reading View:</strong> Appropriate for **reviewing the presentation on one's own computer** comfortably. It displays the slideshow within the application window (not full screen) with simple navigation controls, making it easy to read through the slides and see transitions/animations without the distractions of the editing interface but also without taking over the entire screen like Slide Show view.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(iii) Normal View:</strong> Appropriate for **creating and editing the content and design** of individual slides. It typically shows the main slide editing area, a thumbnail/outline pane, and a notes pane, providing access to all editing tools and different aspects of the slide simultaneously.</li>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Inclusion of Minor Details or Examples:</strong> The summary focuses too much on specific examples, anecdotes, or minor supporting points from the original text, rather than concentrating solely on the main ideas.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Omission of Key Points:</strong> Fails to include one or more of the essential arguments or main ideas presented in the original passage, leading to an incomplete representation of the source.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Plagiarism / Excessive Copying:</strong> Relies too heavily on the original author's phrasing and sentence structure, with insufficient paraphrasing or direct copying without proper attribution (if required).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inclusion of Personal Opinion or Interpretation:</strong> The summary introduces the writer's own views, biases, or interpretations that were not present in the original text, failing to remain objective.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of Cohesion / Poor Flow:</strong> The summarized points are presented disjointedly without clear transitions or logical connections, making it difficult to read and understand as a standalone piece.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Incorrect Length (Too Long or Too Short):</strong> Significantly deviates from the expected or appropriate length for a summary, either being nearly as long as the original or so brief that it misses crucial information.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>To Document Information and Activities:</strong> To provide a formal, objective record of events, investigations, findings, progress, or procedures for accountability, reference, or compliance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>To Analyze Information and Support Decision Making:</strong> To examine data, identify trends, evaluate options, or assess situations, providing management with the analysis needed to make informed business decisions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>To Recommend Actions or Solve Problems:</strong> To propose specific solutions or courses of action based on investigation and analysis, often aiming to persuade the reader to adopt the recommendations.</li>
                                    <li><strong>To Communicate Information Upwards/Downwards/Laterally:</strong> To formally convey information between different levels or departments within the organization (e.g., reporting progress to management, disseminating findings to colleagues).</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Workplace Communication Challenges with Working From Home</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Spontaneous Interaction and Collaboration:</strong> Lack of informal "water cooler" conversations or quick desk-side chats can hinder spontaneous idea generation, informal problem-solving, and team bonding. Collaboration requires more deliberate scheduling and reliance on digital tools.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Potential for Miscommunication (Lack of Non-Verbal Cues):</strong> Heavy reliance on email, chat, or even audio calls means non-verbal cues (body language, facial expressions) are often missing, increasing the risk of misinterpreting tone or intent, leading to misunderstandings.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Difficulty Maintaining Team Cohesion and Culture:</strong> Building and maintaining a strong team spirit and shared organizational culture can be harder when team members are physically dispersed and interact less frequently or less informally.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Blurred Communication Boundaries:</strong> Expectations around response times outside traditional working hours can become blurred, potentially leading to communication overload or pressure to be "always on".</li>
                                    <li><strong>Technology Dependence and Issues:</strong> Effective communication relies heavily on stable internet connectivity and functioning communication tools (video conferencing, chat platforms). Technical glitches can disrupt communication flow.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>Interacting with Senior Officials or Dignitaries:</strong> When interacting with high-ranking executives within the organization, government officials, diplomats, or other dignitaries, specific protocols regarding forms of address, introductions, and communication style are usually expected.</li>
                                    <li><strong>International Business or Diplomacy:</strong> Cross-cultural interactions often require adherence to specific protocols related to greetings, gift-giving, negotiation styles, and business card exchange to show respect and avoid cultural misunderstandings.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Organizations (e.g., Military, Government):</strong> Organizations with strict hierarchies often have established protocols for communication flow, reporting relationships, and showing deference based on rank or position.</li>

                                <p><strong>(f) Strategies for Handling "Know-It-All" Customers</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Acknowledge Their Knowledge and Listen Patiently:</strong> Let them speak and express their knowledge or opinions without interruption (unless excessively lengthy). Acknowledge their points respectfully (e.g., "That's an interesting perspective," "I understand you've researched this"). This validates them and can make them more receptive. Avoid directly challenging their expertise initially.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gently Redirect with Objective Information and Questions:</strong> Instead of contradicting them directly, gently steer the conversation towards the specific product/service facts or ask clarifying questions based on their statements. Frame your input as additional information or alternative perspectives (e.g., "While that's true in some cases, this particular model also features...", "Based on what you said about needing X, have you considered how Y might fit?"). Focus on solving their underlying need rather than winning an argument about who knows more.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Focus on Collaboration and Finding Solutions Together:</strong> Frame the interaction as a collaborative effort (e.g., "Let's work together to find the best fit for you"). Ask for their input on potential solutions based on the information provided. Maintain a calm, professional, and respectful demeanor throughout.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>Create Formal and Anonymous Feedback Channels:</strong> Implement structured ways for employees to provide feedback upwards, such as regular employee surveys focusing on specific issues, a formal suggestion scheme (physical box or online portal, allowing anonymity), or scheduled 'skip-level' meetings where employees can talk to managers above their direct supervisor. Guaranteeing anonymity can encourage more honest feedback from those hesitant to speak directly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Foster an Open and Trusting Culture with Management Training:</strong> Train managers and supervisors on the importance of upward communication, active listening skills, and how to be receptive to feedback (both positive and negative) without being defensive or punitive. Promote an 'open door' policy where employees feel genuinely safe and comfortable approaching management with concerns or ideas. Management must demonstrate through actions that feedback is valued and acted upon where appropriate.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular Team Meetings with Feedback Sessions:</strong> Structure regular team meetings to include dedicated time for open discussion and feedback where employees are explicitly invited to share concerns, challenges, or suggestions related to work processes or the work environment.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Chairperson's Activities in Preparation for a Meeting</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Define Purpose and Develop Agenda:</strong> Clearly establish the meeting's objectives and desired outcomes. Develop a logical agenda outlining topics, potentially allocating time for each, and ensuring it aligns with the meeting's purpose. Consult key participants if necessary for agenda items.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ensure Distribution of Agenda and Materials:</strong> Oversee the timely distribution of the finalized agenda and any necessary pre-reading materials (reports, previous minutes) to all participants, allowing them adequate time to prepare.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Review Background Information and Plan Facilitation:</strong> Familiarize themselves thoroughly with the agenda topics, relevant background information, and previous minutes. Plan how they will introduce each item, guide the discussion, manage time, encourage participation, and steer the meeting towards achieving its objectives. Anticipate potential discussion points or conflicts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Confirm Logistical Arrangements:</strong> Ensure the meeting room, time, date, and necessary equipment (projector, conferencing tools) are confirmed and suitable for the meeting size and purpose.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Perceptions Formed from Interviewee's Appearance</strong></p>
                                <p>Appearance creates a first impression, which can lead to perceptions (accurate or not) about:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Appropriate business attire, neat grooming, and good posture often lead to a perception of professionalism, seriousness about the opportunity, and respect for the organization. Conversely, inappropriate or unkempt appearance might suggest a lack of professionalism or seriousness.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Attention to Detail / Organization:</strong> A well-put-together appearance (clean clothes, neat hair, organized materials) can imply that the candidate is organized and pays attention to detail, traits often valued in employees. A disorganized appearance might suggest the opposite.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> While partly conveyed through body language, neat and appropriate attire can contribute to an impression of self-confidence and self-respect.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cultural Fit:</strong> Appearance (style of dress) might consciously or unconsciously be judged against the perceived culture of the organization, influencing perceptions of whether the candidate would "fit in".</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any two plausible perceptions)*

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Images:</strong> To illustrate concepts visually, make abstract ideas more concrete, evoke emotion, break up text-heavy slides, increase audience engagement and retention, and enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the presentation. A relevant image can often convey meaning more quickly and memorably than words alone.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Bullets (Bulleted Lists):</strong> To present information concisely, break down complex points into digestible chunks, highlight key items or steps, improve readability by avoiding dense paragraphs of text, and provide a clear structure for lists or main points on a slide.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Limited Liability vs. Unlimited Liability</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Unlimited Liability:</strong> The business owner(s) are **personally responsible** for all the debts and obligations incurred by the business. There is **no legal distinction** between the owner's personal assets and the business's assets. If the business cannot pay its debts, creditors can pursue the owner's personal assets (house, car, savings) to recover the amount owed. This applies to **Sole Proprietorships** and **General Partnerships**.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> The business is considered a **separate legal entity** from its owners. The owners' (shareholders' or members') financial liability for the business's debts is **limited** to the amount they have invested in the company (e.g., the value of their shares). Creditors generally cannot pursue the owners' personal assets to satisfy business debts. This protection is a key feature of **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)** and **Corporations (Limited Companies)**.</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Benefits of Agency Banking Services for an Entrepreneur</strong></p>
                                <p>Agency banking involves authorized agents (like local shopkeepers) providing basic banking services on behalf of a financial institution.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Increased Accessibility and Convenience:</strong> Provides access to basic banking services (cash deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, bill payments) closer to the entrepreneur's business location, especially in rural or underserved areas far from traditional bank branches, saving time and travel costs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Extended Service Hours:</strong> Banking agents often operate for longer hours or during weekends compared to bank branches, offering greater flexibility for entrepreneurs to conduct transactions outside standard banking hours.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Transaction Costs (Potentially):</strong> Transaction fees at agents might sometimes be lower than those at a bank branch or ATM for certain services, or reduced travel costs make it cheaper overall.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Advantages of Sales Promotion</strong></p>
                                <p>Sales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or service (e.g., discounts, coupons, contests, free samples, loyalty rewards).</p>

                                    <li><strong>Stimulates Quick Sales Boost:</strong> Provides a direct incentive (like a discount or bonus) that encourages immediate purchase decisions, leading to a short-term increase in sales volume.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Encourages Product Trial:</strong> Techniques like free samples, introductory offers, or demonstrations can persuade potential customers to try a new product for the first time, overcoming initial reluctance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Attracts New Customers:</strong> Special offers can attract price-sensitive customers or those using competitor brands to switch and try the promoted product.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Clears Excess Inventory:</strong> Can be used strategically to sell off old stock, seasonal items, or products nearing their expiry date quickly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Creates Excitement and Interest:</strong> Contests, sweepstakes, or limited-time offers can generate buzz and excitement around a product or brand.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Measurable Results:</strong> The impact of specific sales promotions on sales volume during the promotion period is often relatively easy to track and measure.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Reasons for Business Failure During Start-up Phase</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of Market Need / Poor Product-Market Fit:</strong> Launching a product or service that customers do not actually want or need, or failing to effectively reach the intended target market.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Running Out of Cash / Poor Financial Management:</strong> Insufficient start-up capital, poor cash flow management, underestimating costs, or overspending leads to the inability to cover operational expenses before reaching profitability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inadequate Management Team / Lack of Experience:</strong> Founders lacking the necessary business acumen, industry experience, leadership skills, or financial management capabilities to navigate the challenges of starting and growing a business.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Purposes of a Pre-Feasibility Study</strong></p>
                                <p>A pre-feasibility study is a preliminary analysis conducted before committing to a full, detailed feasibility study or business plan. Its main purposes are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Initial Screening of Viability ("Go/No-Go" Decision):</strong> To quickly assess whether a business opportunity appears fundamentally viable and worth investing further time and resources into a more detailed investigation. It helps identify major roadblocks or "fatal flaws" early on, allowing unpromising ideas to be discarded efficiently.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identifying Key Issues and Areas for Further Study:</strong> To highlight the critical success factors, major potential risks, significant information gaps, and key areas (market, technical, financial) that require in-depth analysis in a subsequent full feasibility study or business plan. It helps define the scope of further investigation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Exploring Broad Alternatives:</strong> Sometimes used to compare several potential business concepts or project alternatives at a high level to determine which one(s) warrant more detailed evaluation.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Social Responsibility Towards Stakeholders</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Towards Suppliers:</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Fair and Prompt Payment:</strong> Paying suppliers on time according to agreed terms for goods and services received.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Ethical Sourcing Practices:</strong> Engaging in fair negotiations, avoiding undue pressure, honoring contracts, and potentially considering suppliers' own ethical/environmental practices when making purchasing decisions.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Building Long-Term Relationships:</strong> Fostering stable, mutually beneficial relationships based on trust and open communication, rather than purely exploitative short-term gains.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Providing Clear Specifications:</strong> Giving clear requirements and specifications for ordered goods/services to avoid confusion and disputes.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                     <li><strong>(ii) Towards Employees:</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Fair Wages and Benefits:</strong> Providing fair compensation, timely payment, and reasonable benefits (health insurance, leave, retirement contributions) compliant with or exceeding legal requirements.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Safe and Healthy Working Environment:</strong> Ensuring workplace safety standards are met, providing necessary safety equipment and training, and promoting employee well-being.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Opportunities for Development and Growth:</strong> Offering training, skill development programs, and opportunities for career advancement within the organization.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Respectful Treatment and Non-Discrimination:</strong> Treating all employees with respect, ensuring fair treatment regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, etc., and providing channels for addressing grievances fairly.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Implementing policies and practices that support a reasonable balance between work responsibilities and employees' personal lives.</li>
                                        </ol>
