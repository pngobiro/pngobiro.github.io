\section*{The Construction Industry}

The construction industry is very important for the Kenya economy. It accounts for $5 \%$ of the country's GDP and employs about 1 million people with an estimated annual wage bill of Sh3 2 billion.

According to recent findings by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Kenya's economy grew by $4.9 \%$ in the first quarter of 2011 thanks to the improved productivity in the construction industry.

NBS reported that the industry contributed Sh12.6 billion to countries GDP in I st quarter of 2011 buoyed by the large road infrastructure projects currently under way across the country.

The construction was also reflected in cement consumption which rose from 77.3 million tonnes up from 667.1 million tonnes consumed in 2010.

This has seen an increase on the demand for other engineering professionals to be subcontracted in this industry.
