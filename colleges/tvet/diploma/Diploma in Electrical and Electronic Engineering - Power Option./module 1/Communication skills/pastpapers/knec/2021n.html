                                <p class="answer-intro">This question defines types of computers and software, and distinguishes input/output devices.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Types of Computers</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Dedicated Computer:</strong> A computer system designed and assigned to perform **only one specific function or task**, often continuously. It is optimized for that particular job and typically does not run general-purpose applications. Examples include computers controlling industrial machinery, network routers, ATMs, or systems embedded within appliances like washing machines or cars.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Special Purpose Computer:</strong> Similar to a dedicated computer, this is a computer designed to perform a specific type of task or a limited range of tasks, rather than general-purpose computing. The hardware and software are optimized for that specific application. While a dedicated computer often does just one thing, a special-purpose computer might handle a specific set of related tasks (e.g., a navigation system, a gaming console, a scientific calculator). The terms are often used interchangeably.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Input Devices vs. Output Devices</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Hardware components used to **provide data and control signals** to a computer system from the outside world. They allow users or other systems to enter information (text, images, sound, commands) into the computer for processing.
                                        <br><em>Examples:</em> Keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, webcam, barcode reader, joystick.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Hardware components used to **present the results of data processing** from the computer system to the user or another device in a human-perceptible or machine-readable form. They convey information *out* of the computer.
                                        <br><em>Examples:</em> Monitor (display screen), printer, speakers, projector, headphones, plotter.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Key Distinction:</em> Input devices send data *into* the computer; output devices present processed data *from* the computer.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Computer Software Functions</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Utility Programme (Utility Software):</strong> System software designed to help manage, maintain, configure, optimize, or secure the computer system. It performs specific housekeeping or support tasks related to the hardware, operating system, or data storage. Examples: Antivirus software, disk cleanup, file compression tools, backup utilities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Operating System (OS):</strong> The core system software that manages the computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and application software, handling tasks like process management, memory management, file system management, device management, and providing a user interface. Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reasons for Partitioning a Hard Disk</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Operating System Management:</strong> Allows installation of multiple operating systems on the same physical drive, each in its own partition, enabling dual-booting or multi-booting setups.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Organization and Separation:</strong> Enables logical separation of data, such as keeping the operating system and program files on one partition (e.g., C:) and user data files (documents, pictures) on another (e.g., D:). This can simplify backups and protect user data if the OS partition needs to be reformatted or reinstalled.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Performance (Historically):</strong> On very large HDDs, partitioning could sometimes slightly improve performance by reducing the area the read/write heads needed to seek within for specific files (though less relevant with modern drives and OS).</li>
                                    <li><strong>File System Requirements:</strong> Different operating systems or specific applications might require different file system formats (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4), which can be applied to separate partitions on the same drive.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Simplified Backup/Imaging:</strong> Allows backup or disk imaging software to target specific partitions (like the OS partition) rather than the entire physical drive.</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any two reasons)*

                                <p><strong>(b) Steps to Double Underline Text</strong></p>

                                            </ul>
                                            <em>Alternatively:</em> Use a keyboard shortcut if available (e.g., in Word, `Ctrl + Shift + D`). Or open the Font dialog box (often `Ctrl + D`) and select "Double" from the "Underline style" dropdown.

                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question defines data security, suggests ways to improve it in institutions, and explains spreadsheet structure.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Data Security</strong></p>
                                <p>Data security refers to the practice of protecting digital information (data) from unauthorized access, corruption, theft, or destruction throughout its entire lifecycle. It encompasses implementing protective measures – including policies, procedures, and technologies (like encryption, access controls, firewalls) – to ensure the confidentiality (preventing unauthorized disclosure), integrity (preventing unauthorized modification), and availability (ensuring authorized users can access it when needed) of data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Ways of Improving Data Security in a Learning Institution</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Implement Strong Access Controls:</strong> Use strong, unique passwords for all student and staff accounts, enforce regular password changes, and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Apply role-based access control (RBAC) so users only have access to the data and systems necessary for their roles (e.g., students shouldn't access staff records).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory training for staff and students on recognizing phishing emails, creating strong passwords, safe browsing habits, understanding data privacy policies, and reporting security incidents. Human error is often a major vulnerability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Encryption and Backups:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data (student records, financial information) both when stored (at rest) and transmitted (in transit). Implement a robust data backup strategy with regular, tested backups stored securely offsite to ensure data can be recovered in case of loss or ransomware attack.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Network Security Measures:</strong> Use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware software on all institutional computers and servers. Secure the Wi-Fi network with strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3).</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any two ways)*

                                <p><strong>(c) Structure of a Worksheet (Spreadsheet Application)</strong></p>
                                <p>A worksheet is the primary document within a spreadsheet application (like Excel or Google Sheets) used for organizing and manipulating data. Its structure is a grid.</p>
                                <p><strong>Key Structural Elements:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cells:</strong> The basic unit of a worksheet, formed by the intersection of a row and a column. Each cell can hold data (text, numbers, dates) or formulas. Cells are identified by their address (e.g., A1, B5, C10). The currently selected cell is the **Active Cell**.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rows:</strong> Horizontal lines of cells running across the worksheet. Rows are typically identified by sequential numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) displayed down the left side.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Columns:</strong> Vertical lines of cells running down the worksheet. Columns are typically identified by sequential letters (A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...) displayed across the top.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gridlines:</strong> Faint lines separating the rows and columns, making the grid structure visible.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Formula Bar:</strong> An area (usually above the grid) that displays the contents (data or formula) of the active cell. It is also used for entering or editing formulas and data.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Name Box:</strong> An area (usually to the left of the formula bar) that displays the address of the active cell or the name of a selected range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Worksheet Tabs:</strong> Tabs (usually at the bottom) that allow users to navigate between different worksheets within the same spreadsheet file (workbook).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Allows multiple users to share expensive hardware resources (like printers, scanners, servers), software licenses, and internet connections, reducing costs and improving resource utilization.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Facilitates quick and efficient communication among employees through email, instant messaging, shared calendars, and collaborative software, regardless of their physical location within the organization.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Centralized Data Storage and Management:</strong> Enables data to be stored centrally on servers, making it easier to manage, back up, secure, and access consistently by authorized users across the organization.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Information Sharing:</strong> Allows easy sharing of files, documents, and information among employees, improving access to up-to-date data and facilitating teamwork.</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any two benefits)*

                                <p><strong>(b) Purpose of Database Objects</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Query:</strong> To ask questions of the database; to retrieve, filter, sort, group, calculate, and combine specific data from one or more tables based on defined criteria.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Form:</strong> To provide a user-friendly graphical interface for entering, viewing, and editing data in tables, often displaying one record at a time in a structured layout.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(iii) Table:</strong> The fundamental object for storing data in an organized structure of rows (records) and columns (fields), representing entities and their attributes.</li>
                                </ul>
                                *(See also Q3c from July 2017 paper)*

                                <p><strong>(c) Merits of Keeping Employee Records in a Computerized Database</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Efficient Data Retrieval and Searching:</strong> Allows HR staff or managers to quickly search for and retrieve specific employee information (e.g., contact details, employment history, skills, leave balance) using query functions, saving significant time compared to searching through physical files.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Data Accuracy and Consistency:</strong> Reduces data entry errors compared to manual systems. Validation rules can be implemented to ensure data consistency (e.g., correct date formats, predefined department lists), leading to more reliable employee information.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Access Control:</strong> Allows for better control over who can access sensitive employee information through user accounts, passwords, and permission levels, improving confidentiality compared to physical files that might be more easily accessible. Audit trails can track access.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Space Saving and Easier Backup:</strong> Digital records require significantly less physical storage space than paper files. Backing up computerized records electronically is much easier, faster, and more reliable than photocopying paper records.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Easier Reporting and Analysis:</strong> Enables quick generation of various reports (e.g., staff lists, salary reports, leave summaries, demographic analysis) based on the stored data, facilitating HR planning and compliance reporting.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question distinguishes cropping/resizing, explains presentation features, and gives reasons for fiber optic popularity over satellite.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Cropping vs. Re-sizing (Graphics in DTP)</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cropping:</strong> **Removes unwanted outer portions** of a graphic image, effectively changing its composition and dimensions by cutting away parts of the original image. The remaining part of the image retains its original scale and resolution, but the overall size of the visible area is reduced. It's like cutting out a smaller section from a larger photograph.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Re-sizing (Scaling):</strong> **Changes the overall dimensions** (height and width) of the entire graphic image, making it larger or smaller while keeping the entire original composition visible. Resizing affects the scale of the image; enlarging can sometimes lead to loss of quality (pixelation) if the original resolution is low, while shrinking generally maintains quality.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Key Distinction:</em> Cropping cuts parts *away* from the image content; resizing changes the overall *scale* of the entire image content.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Presentation Package Features</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Slide Sorter (View):</strong> Displays thumbnail views of all slides in the presentation simultaneously. Its purpose is to provide an overview of the entire presentation structure and allow the user to easily **reorder slides** by dragging and dropping, apply transitions or timings to multiple slides, or delete slides.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Animation:</strong> Refers to adding visual motion effects to **individual elements** (text, images, shapes) *within* a slide. Its purpose is to control how these elements appear, are emphasized, or disappear during the slide show, potentially drawing attention to key points, revealing information sequentially, or adding visual interest (though overuse can be distracting).</li>
                                </ul>
                                *(Note: Animation applies to elements on a slide; Transitions apply to the way the entire slide enters or exits)*

                                <p><strong>(c) Reasons for Fiber Optic Popularity Over Satellite Links</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Lower Latency:</strong> Fiber optic cables transmit data as light pulses over relatively short terrestrial distances. Satellite links involve transmitting signals up to a satellite in geostationary orbit (approx. 36,000 km) and back down, resulting in significantly higher latency (signal delay). Low latency is crucial for real-time applications like online gaming, video conferencing, and financial transactions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Bandwidth and Speed:</strong> Fiber optic cables typically offer much higher potential bandwidth and consistently faster data transfer speeds compared to most satellite internet services, which often have capacity limitations and speeds affected by weather or network congestion.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Greater Reliability:</strong> Fiber optic connections are generally more stable and less susceptible to environmental interference (like rain fade or atmospheric conditions) that can significantly impact satellite signal quality and reliability.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li><strong>Higher Employee Turnover:</strong> Employees dissatisfied with poor communication and feeling disconnected from the organization are more likely to leave, increasing recruitment and training costs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Lack of clear, timely, and two-way communication about organizational changes often leads to increased employee anxiety, resistance, and difficulty in implementing changes successfully.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Message Encoding vs. Message Decoding</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> This is the process performed by the **sender** in the communication process. It involves translating their thoughts, ideas, or feelings into a communicable format using symbols (like words, gestures, images, sounds) that they believe the receiver will understand. The choice of symbols and structure forms the message.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> This is the process performed by the **receiver**. It involves receiving the sender's message through a channel and interpreting the symbols used to reconstruct the meaning intended by the sender. The receiver translates the symbols back into their own thoughts or understanding.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Key Distinction:</em> Encoding is converting thoughts into a message (by the sender); Decoding is interpreting the message back into thoughts (by the receiver).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Benefits of Grapevine Communication to an Organization</strong></p>
                                <p>While often associated with rumors, the informal grapevine network can have benefits:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Speed of Information Dissemination:</strong> Information (both accurate and inaccurate) often travels much faster through the informal grapevine than through formal channels, which can be useful for quickly spreading non-critical information or gauging initial reactions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism for Management:</strong> By unofficially monitoring the grapevine, managers can get insights into employee attitudes, concerns, morale, and potential issues that might not surface through formal upward communication channels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Social Bonding and Cohesion:</strong> The grapevine facilitates informal social interaction among employees, helping to build relationships, foster a sense of belonging, and satisfy social needs within the workplace.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Supplementing Formal Channels:</strong> Can sometimes help clarify or translate formal messages into terms more easily understood by employees, although this also carries the risk of distortion.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(d) Essay: The Challenges Faced by Employees Who Work From Home</strong></p>

                                <h4 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Challenges Faced by Employees Who Work From Home</h4>

                                <p>The rise of remote work, accelerated by technological advancements and global events, offers undeniable flexibility but also presents a unique set of challenges for employees operating outside the traditional office environment. While working from home can enhance autonomy and reduce commuting stress, individuals often grapple with significant hurdles related to boundaries, isolation, communication, and maintaining productivity, impacting both their professional effectiveness and personal well-being.</p>

                                <p>One of the primary challenges is **maintaining work-life balance**. The physical separation between office and home disappears, making it difficult for employees to mentally "switch off" from work. Household chores, family demands, and the constant accessibility enabled by technology can blur boundaries, leading to longer working hours, increased stress, and potential burnout. Establishing a dedicated workspace and adhering to a structured routine becomes crucial, yet often difficult, to mitigate this overlap.</p>

                                <p>Another significant challenge is **social and professional isolation**. Remote employees miss out on the spontaneous interactions, informal learning opportunities, and camaraderie fostered in a shared physical workspace. This lack of regular face-to-face contact can lead to feelings of loneliness, disconnection from the team and company culture, and potentially hinder collaboration and career development opportunities that arise from visibility and networking within the office.</p>

                                <p>Furthermore, **communication and collaboration can become more complex**. While digital tools facilitate remote communication, they lack the richness of in-person interaction. Misunderstandings can arise more easily due to the absence of non-verbal cues. Coordinating tasks, brainstorming effectively, and maintaining team cohesion require more deliberate effort and reliance on technology, which may not always function seamlessly. Access to immediate support or clarification from colleagues or supervisors can also be delayed.</p>

                                <p>Finally, **maintaining focus and productivity** can be difficult amidst home-based distractions. Interruptions from family members, pets, household tasks, or the temptations of non-work activities require significant self-discipline. Moreover, ensuring adequate technological infrastructure, such as reliable internet connectivity and appropriate equipment, remains the responsibility of the employee in many cases, posing an additional challenge.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">In conclusion, while remote work offers advantages, employees face substantial challenges in managing boundaries, combating isolation, ensuring effective communication, and sustaining productivity. Addressing these requires conscious effort from the individual and supportive strategies from employers to make working from home a truly sustainable and positive experience.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Closed-Off Posture:</strong> Slouching, leaning back excessively, crossing arms tightly, or physically turning away can signal disinterest and a lack of openness to the interaction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Minimal or Delayed Responses:</strong> Providing only brief, non-committal verbal responses (e.g., "uh-huh") or showing delayed reactions to questions or statements.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Impulse Customer:</strong> Makes unplanned purchase decisions, often on the spur of the moment. Their buying behavior is typically triggered by seeing a product displayed attractively, a special offer, or an emotional response, rather than a pre-existing need. They didn't necessarily intend to buy that specific item when they entered the store or visited the website.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Need-Based Customer:</strong> Enters a transaction with a specific, predetermined need or problem they intend to address. They are looking for a particular product or service to fulfill that requirement and their purchase decision is driven primarily by functionality, necessity, and meeting that specific need efficiently. They are less likely to be swayed by unrelated promotions or displays.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Provide Resources and Support:</strong> Allocate time, funding, and mentorship for employees to develop and test new ideas (intrapreneurship).</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Fabian Entrepreneur vs. Innovative Entrepreneur</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Fabian Entrepreneur:</strong> Characterized by **caution and skepticism** towards change and innovation. They are reluctant to adopt new technologies or methods unless there is clear evidence of success or pressure from competitors forces them to do so to avoid significant disadvantage. They prioritize maintaining the status quo and minimizing risk over pioneering new approaches.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Innovative Entrepreneur:</strong> Characterized by a **proactive drive to create and introduce novelty**. They actively seek out opportunities to develop new products, services, technologies, processes, or business models that disrupt existing markets or create new ones. They are often pioneers, willing to take significant risks associated with introducing something fundamentally new.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Key Distinction:</em> Innovative entrepreneurs actively create and introduce novelty, often disrupting markets, while Fabian entrepreneurs are highly cautious and only adopt innovations when absolutely necessary.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Encourage Wild Ideas:</strong> Welcome unconventional, seemingly impractical, or "wild" ideas, as these can sometimes spark truly innovative solutions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Build on Others' Ideas:</strong> Listen to suggestions from others and try to combine or improve upon them ("Yes, and..." approach).</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Entrepreneurship's Contribution to National Income</strong></p>
                                <p>National income (often measured by GDP - Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of goods and services produced within a country in a specific period.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Production of Goods and Services:</strong> Entrepreneurs create new businesses that produce goods and provide services, directly adding to the total output and value generated within the economy, thus increasing the national income (GDP).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Job Creation and Income Generation:</strong> By starting and growing businesses, entrepreneurs create jobs. Employed individuals earn wages and salaries, increasing household income. This income is then spent on goods and services, further boosting economic activity and contributing indirectly to national income through consumption and taxes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Innovation and Productivity Gains:</strong> Entrepreneurial ventures often introduce innovations or efficiencies that increase productivity within industries. Higher productivity means more output can be generated with the same or fewer inputs, leading to economic growth and a higher national income.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tax Revenue Generation:</strong> Profitable enterprises and their employees pay taxes (corporate tax, income tax, VAT) to the government, contributing to public revenue which forms part of the national income framework and funds public services.</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any two ways explained)*

                                <p><strong>(b) Management Responsibility for Time Wastage</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Poor Planning and Scheduling:</strong> Inadequate planning of tasks, unrealistic deadlines, or poor scheduling of work can lead to employees waiting for instructions, resources, or preceding tasks to be completed, resulting in idle time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Unnecessary or Poorly Run Meetings:</strong> Calling frequent, lengthy, or poorly structured meetings without clear agendas or objectives consumes valuable employee time that could be spent on productive tasks.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of Clear Instructions or Delegation:</strong> Providing unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete instructions forces employees to waste time seeking clarification or redoing work. Micromanagement or failure to delegate appropriately can also slow down processes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inefficient Processes and Bureaucracy:</strong> Implementing overly complex procedures, excessive paperwork requirements, or slow approval processes creates bottlenecks and forces employees to spend time on non-value-adding administrative tasks.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inadequate Resources or Training:</strong> Failing to provide employees with the necessary tools, equipment, information, or training to perform their jobs efficiently can lead to significant time wastage as they struggle with inadequate resources or lack the required skills.</li>
                                </ol>
                                *(Any three circumstances)*

                                <p><strong>(c) Roles Played by Banks in Entrepreneurship Development</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Providing Finance/Credit:</strong> Offering loans (start-up loans, working capital loans, asset finance), overdraft facilities, and other forms of credit essential for entrepreneurs to start, operate, and expand their businesses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Offering Business Banking Services:</strong> Providing essential banking services tailored for businesses, such as business current accounts, payment processing services (cheques, transfers, online payments), foreign exchange services, and cash management solutions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Advisory and Support Services:</strong> Some banks offer advisory services to entrepreneurs on financial planning, business management, accessing markets, or connecting them with other support networks or potential investors, particularly through specialized SME banking units.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Facilitating Trade:</strong> Providing trade finance instruments like letters of credit or guarantees that facilitate domestic and international trade for entrepreneurial ventures.</li>
