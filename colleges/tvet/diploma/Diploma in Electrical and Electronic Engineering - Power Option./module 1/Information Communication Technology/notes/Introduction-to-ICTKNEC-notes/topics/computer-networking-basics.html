                                <p>The smallest and simplest networks are called local area networks (LANs), which extend over only a small area, typically within a single office, building or a part thereof. In addition to operating in a limited space, LANs are also typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization. They also tend to use certain connectivity technologies, primarily Ethernet and Token Ring. A home network is a type of LAN that is contained within a user's residence.</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">Wide Area Networks (WANs)</span>
                                <p>Wide area networks (WANs) can extend over a large geographic area e.g. across metropolitan, regional, national or continental boundaries and are connected via the telephone network or radio waves. A WAN is a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs. A network device called a router connects LANs to a WAN. In IP networking, the router maintains both a LAN address and a WAN address.</p>
                                <p>A WAN differs from a LAN in several important ways. Most WANs (like the Internet) are not owned by any one organization but rather exist under collective or distributed ownership and management; WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.</p>

                                <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is designed to serve a town or city, and a campus area network is designed to serve a university, military base or an educational institution. A metropolitan area spans a physical area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city. A MAN is typically owned and operated by a single entity such as a government body or large corporation.</p>

                                <p>An intranet is a private network within an organization that uses the same communications protocols as the Internet (internet protocol). It is sometimes contrasted to extranets. An Intranet is used strictly within the confines of a company, university, or organization and is based on the internet standards (HTML, HTTP & TCP/IP protocols). An intranet's Web sites look and acts just like any other Web sites, but the firewall surrounding an intranet fends off unauthorized access.</p>

                                <p>This is a computer network that allows controlled access from the outside, for specific business or educational purposes. It uses Internet technology and the public telecommunication system to securely share part of a business's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. An extranet requires security and privacy. These can include firewall server management, the issuance and use of digital certificates or similar means of user authentication, encryption of messages, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that tunnel through the public network.</p>

                                <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a network that uses a public telecommunication infrastructure, such as the Internet, to provide remote offices or individual users with secure access to their organization's network. A virtual private network can be contrasted with an expensive system of owned or leased lines that can only be used by one organization. The goal of a VPN is to provide the organization with the same capabilities, but at a much lower cost</p>

The Internet is, therefore, an internet.</p>
                                <p>TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication technologies for a single network segment (link), the internet layer, connecting hosts across independent networks, thus establishing internetworking, the transport layer handling host-to-host communication, and the application layer, which provides process-to-process application data exchange e.g. HTTP, SMTP, FTP.</p>

The clients run programs and access data that are stored on the server. Network Clients (Workstations) computers request network resources or services while the network Servers provide network resources and services to clients.</p>
                        <p>A server usually has more processing power, memory and hard disk space than clients and run Network Operating System that can manage not only data, but also users, groups, security, and applications on the network. Servers often have a more stringent requirement on its performance and reliability.</p>
                        <p>Server-based networks use a dedicated, centralized server. All administrative functions and resource sharing are performed from this point. This makes it easier to share resources, perform backups, and support an almost unlimited number of users. It also offers better security. However, it does need more hardware than that used by the typical workstation/server computer in a peer-to-peer resource model.</p>
                        <p>A good example of a server based network is a domain which refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that are administered as a unit with common rules and procedures. Domain-based networks are composed of any number of computers and at least one Domain Controller (DC). The workstations could be used by employees and users in the organization, while the Domain Controller, known as a Server, is capable of managing the user workstations in many different respects.</p>
