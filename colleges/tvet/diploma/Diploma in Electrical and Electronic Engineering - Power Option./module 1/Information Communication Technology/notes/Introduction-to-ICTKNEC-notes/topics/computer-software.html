The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal such as solving a large computational problem. The computers are geographically dispersed but linked by communication lines. This seamless integration of individual nodes into a global system is referred to as transparency.</span></li>

They are designed to operate on small machines like PDAs with a limited number of resources. They are very compact and extremely efficient by design. Examples include Windows CE and Minix 3. Embedded systems range from portable devices such as digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic lights, factory controllers and large complex systems like hybrid vehicles, MRI, and avionics.</span></li>

                                <p>Spooling batch systems use the concept of spooling which is an acronym for Simultaneous Peripheral Operations online. Spooling refers to putting data in a buffer, a special area in memory or on a disk where an output device such as a printer can access them when it is ready. Spooling is useful because devices access data at much slower rates than the CPU. The buffer provides a waiting station where data can rest while the slower device catches up. The most common spooling application is print spooling. In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer and then the printer pulls them off the buffer at its own rate.</p>

When a file is saved, the operating system saves it, attaches a name to it, and remembers where it put the file for future use. The way an operating system organizes information into files is called a file system. Most operating systems use a hierarchical file system, which organizes files into directories (folders) under a tree structure. The beginning of the directory system is called the root directory e.g. C:\. The figure below shows a screenshot of tree structure when using Windows Explorer.</span>

                        <p>Application software is further classified into general-purpose software and special purpose applications. General purpose application software is a type of software that can be used for a variety of tasks. It is not limited to one particular function. For example a word processor could be classed as general purpose software as it would allow a user to write a novel, create a restaurant menu or even make a poster.</p>
                        <p>Special purpose application software, on the other hand, is a type of software created to execute one specific task. For example a camera application on your phone will only allow you to take and share pictures.</p>

                        <p>Note: Some application software come in suites. A software suite refers to related but independent programs and packages that have a common user interface or shared data format, such as Microsoft Office. The programs in a software suite are designed to be used together. In addition, the commands, the icons and procedures are the same for all programs in the suite.</p>

                        <p>There are six key software evaluation criteria that should be considered in an organization's software decision.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(i)</span><span class="item-text">Functionality - Software should have the right functionality to fit your industry specific requirements. Just because the software is well known, does not mean the vendor has the specific functionality you need to run your business.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(ii)</span><span class="item-text">Technology - The software must be a match for the platform and database that you are running and the expertise of the IT staff that you have in-house.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(iii)</span><span class="item-text">Software Vendor - The software vendor is a critical part of the software selection process. You are not just buying a static software solution; you are actually buying a relationship with that software vendor. You will be paying annual maintenance so that they will continue to develop, enhance, and improve the product.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(iv)</span><span class="item-text">Value Added Reseller (VAR) - If you are acquiring software from a VAR, the company needs to have experience with the software product that you are implementing and the industry that you are in. You have many VAR/Implementation Partner options available to you. Make sure you get one that has a focus in your industry. A Value Added Reseller is a company that adds features or services to an existing product and then resells it usually to end-users. The added value can come in form of integrating, customizing, consulting, training and implementation.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(v)</span><span class="item-text">Maintenance & Support - You can expect to pay between 18-25% of the license cost for maintenance. This entitles you to upgrades and some level of support. You should make sure that this investment you will be making on an annual basis will be appropriate.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(vi)</span><span class="item-text">Total Cost of Ownership - You need to consider the total cost of ownership of the software solution and not just the big discount that the vendor may be offering for the up-front license cost. There are 3 main components of out-of-pocket cost that should be considered. These components include the software license, software maintenance, and implementation services. You should look at the cost for the next 5-7 years in order to get a good idea of the long term cost to your organization.</span></li>
