                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hardware safety protects the machine and peripheral hardware from theft and from electronic intrusion and damage. Hardware safety can be ensured through:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="safety-against-theft">a) Safety Against Theft</h3>
                        <p>Computers are very valuable and relatively portable they and can easily be stolen which would be made worse by the loss of the valuable data stored on them. Physical safety should be put in place such as locking the rooms, installing alarm systems and Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) where they are kept to prevent theft. The computers can also be bolted to benches or cabinets in order to make theft difficult.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="protection-from-power-interruptions">b) Protection from Power Interruptions</h3>
                        <p>The power delivered to computers should be stable and constant but sometimes fluctuations in power supply occur. For example, voltage surges and spikes, a blackout or brownout can cause a computer to shut down abruptly. Information that is stored only in short-term memory will be lost. As well, the fluctuation can physically damage computer components such as the power supply unit. Computer systems can be protected from such interruptions through:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="use-of-uninterruptible-power-supply">i) Use of uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</h4>
                        <p>A UPS is a device that allows a computer to keep running for at least a short time after the primary power source is lost. The device also provides protection against power surges and drops.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="use-of-power-surge-protectors">ii) Use of power surge protectors/suppressors</h4>
                        <p>A surge protector or suppressor is an appliance designed to protect electrical devices from voltage spikes caused by events like lightning strikes and short circuits. Voltage spikes might damage a computer's electronic parts, melting plastic and metal parts or even corrupting the data stored on the computer. Surge protectors limit the voltage supplied to a device by either blocking the unwanted voltages or by shorting the voltages to ground.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="environmental-safety">c) Environmental Safety</h3>
                        <p>Computers also require the right balance of physical and environmental conditions to operate properly. Measures should be put in place to protect computers from fire, smoke, dust, excessive temperatures, high levels of humidity and electrical noise such as from motors. Such measures include installation of climate control systems and dehumidifiers, fire fighting systems etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="other-physical-measures">d) Other physical measures</h3>
                        <p>include the disabling of USB ports or CD ROM Drives, installation of drive locks and case intrusion detection. This will help in protecting against unauthorized copying and transfer of data as well as preventing infection of the computer with viruses through portable storage devices such as pen drives.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Logical/Software Safety consists of software safeguards for a system, including user identification mechanisms and safety software. These measures ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation.</p>
                        <p>Elements of logical safety include:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="biometric-authentication">a) Biometric authentication</h3>
                        <p>Biometric authentication is the use of a user's physiological features to confirm their identity before they are allowed access to a computer system. These features include software that verify user identification through fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial bone structure etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="token-authentication">b) Token authentication</h3>
                        <p>Token authentication comprises safety tokens which are small devices that authorized users of computer systems or networks carry to assist in identifying them as they log into the system. They include smart cards or small USB drives with built-in code generators and are inserted to the computer through USB ports.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="password-authentication">c) Password authentication</h3>
                        <p>This method uses secret data e.g. strings of character to control access to a system and is normally used together with usernames. The passwords are either created by the user or assigned by system administrators. Usually, limitations to password creation include length restrictions, a requirement of number characters, uppercase letters or special characters. The system may also force a user to change their passwords after a given amount of time.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="access-rights">d) Access Rights</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="audit-trails">e) Audit Trails</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="use-of-safety-software">f) Use of Safety Software</h3>
                        <p>Safety software refers to any computer program whose purpose is to help secure a computer system or a computer network. Types of safety software include Antivirus software, Anti-key loggers, Anti-Spam software, Firewall systems etc</p>
                        <p>These software systems protect computers and the data they hold from various threats. The threats include, among others, industrial espionage, loss of data to hackers (people who exploit weaknesses in a computer system to gain access and motivated by reasons like profit/theft of data, protest or challenge) and attacks from malicious code such as:</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">viruses</span>
                                <p>A virus is a malicious program that replicates itself and spreads from one computer to another. They attach themselves to existing programs in order to spread. Viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Trojan horses</span>
                                <p>This is a type of malware (malicious software) that gains privileged access to a computer system while appearing to perform a desirable function but instead installs a malicious code that allows unauthorized access to the target computer. They usually come as free software offers in some websites which users download and install on their machines.</p>
                                <p>Trojans do not self-replicate. Distribution channels include e-mail, malicious or hacked Web pages, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), peer-to-peer networks etc.</p>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Worms</span>
                                <p>Worms are malware that spread themselves to other computers using computer networks and do not need to attach themselves to existing software. They harm networks by consuming bandwidth (by increasing network traffic etc) but do not attempt to change the systems they pass through.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Rootkits</span>
                                <p>A rootkit is a type of malicious software that is activated each time your system boots up. Rootkits are difficult to detect because they are activated before the Operating System has completely booted up. A rootkit often allows the installation of hidden files, processes, hidden user accounts, and more in the systems OS. They are also able to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Keyloggers</span>
                                <p>This is a type of malware that records (or logs) the keys struck on a keyboard, usually in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and then the information is transmitted to the originators.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Anti-virus software include Norton, AVG, Kaspersky, MacAfee, Avast etc. These software programs are meant to prevent, detect and remove malicious software from computer systems.</p>
                        <p>The software come with a database of all known or identified malware against which they protect the systems they are installed on. The databases and the software themselves need to be updated regularly to ensure continued protection for the system. Once installed on a machine, the anti-virus software always runs in the background watching out for suspicious activity that could be initiated by a virus and if it makes detection, it warns the computer user and provides a solution to the threat.</p>
                        <p>A virus scan involves the examining of the content of the computer's memory (RAM and boot sectors) and the files stored on fixed and removable drives and comparing those files against the database of known viruses.</p>
                        <p>Anti-virus software should be registered in order to be used even if they are offered free of charge. Software registration is a means of providing the End-User with a license from the developer which makes the use of the software legal. It also makes it possible for the End-User to update the software for continued protection.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="firewalls">Firewalls</h4>
                        <p>A firewall is software or hardware-based network safety system that controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic by analyzing the data packets and determining whether they should be allowed through or not, based on set rules.</p>
