                        <p>This is by how the computer represents and processes the data.</p>

                                <p>Digital computers process data represented in binary format using the numbers 0 and 1 . They are used for both business data processing and scientific purposes since digital computation results in greater accuracy than analog computers. They also can perform complex computations. They are the most commonly used type of computers.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Analog computers</strong></span>
                                <p>These are used for scientific, engineering, and process-controlled purposes. Outputs are represented in the form of graphs. Analogue computers process data represented by physical variables and output physical magnitudes in the form of smooth graphs. These physical changes include changes in electronic voltages, pressure changes, temperature changes etc. Analog values, unlike digital values, are typically many values in a range. Examples of analogue devices include car speedometer and the slide rule.</p>
                            </li>

They offer an efficient and economical method of working out special problems in science and various areas of engineering.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Consider the difference between two common types of light switches: a standard light switch and a dimmer switch. The standard light switch has only two values: on and off. As a rule, at any one time the switch will be in either one position or the other. This is similar to digital electrical signals, which have discrete values (like on and off). By way of comparison, the dimmer switch starts at off, but can be changed gradually to stronger and stronger intensities, up to the full on setting. At any one instant, a dimmer switch can have a setting almost anywhere between on and off. This is similar to an analog electrical signal, which may be on or off or somewhere in between.</p>
                        <p>NB/ The main feature that distinguishes digital from analog computers is the nature of the signals. Digital signals have two discrete states, on or off. Analog signals are continuous. An analog signal's voltage may be constant or vary with time.</p>
