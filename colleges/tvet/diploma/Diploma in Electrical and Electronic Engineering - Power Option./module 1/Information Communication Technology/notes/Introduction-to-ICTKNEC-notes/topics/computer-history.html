                        <p>The abacus, which emerged about 5,000 years ago in Asia Minor and is still in use today, may be considered the first computer. This device allows users to make computations using a system of sliding beads arranged on a rack; it was simply a counting device.</p>

                        <p>It took long for the next significant advance in computing devices to emerge. In 1642, Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), the 18-year-old son of a French tax collector, invented what he called a numerical wheel calculator to help his father with his duties but which used eight movable dials to add sums up. It was not until the 1940s that the electronic computers emerged.</p>
                        <p>In the 1820s, Charles Babbage designed the 'Difference Engine', a machine which could perform mathematical calculations. A six-wheeled model was initially constructed and demonstrated to a number of audiences. He also worked on another invention, the more complex Analytical Engine, a revolutionary device which was intended to be able to perform any arithmetical calculation using punched cards that would deliver the instructions, as well as a memory unit to store numbers and many other fundamental components of today's computers. Lady Ada produced programs to be used by the analytical machine. She is claimed to be possibly the first programmer.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Modern computers can be classified into five generations.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="first-generation">First generation: 1946-1959.</h3>
                        <p>First generation of computers started with using vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes like electric bulbs produced a lot of heat and were prone to frequent fusing of the installations, therefore, were very expensive and could be afforded only by very large organizations. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was announced in 1946. It cost almost $500,000 (approximately $6,000,000 today). The computer contained 17,468 vacuum tubes and consumed 150 kW of electricity.</p>
                        <p>Another example of computers in this generation was the UNIVersal Automatic Computer I (UNIVAC) which used 5200 vacuum tubes and weighed 13 metric tons. It consumed 125 kW , and could perform about 1,905 operations per second.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-006-1.jpg" alt="Image of Vacuum Tubes" class="content-image">
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Vacuum Tubes</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>In this generation mainly batch processing of data was done. In this generation Punched cards, Paper tape, Magnetic tape Input & Output device were used. It is said that this computer weighed 30 tons, and had 18,000 vacuum tubes which were used for processing. When this computer was turned on for the first time lights dimmed in sections of Philadelphia. Computers of this generation could only perform a single task at a time, and they had no operating system.</p>
                        <p>NB: Batch processing- Executing a series of non-interactive jobs all at one time.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="second-generation">Second generation: 1959-1965.</h3>
                        <p>Computers in this generation using the transistor were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.</p>
                        <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-007-1.jpg" alt="Image of a Transistor" class="content-image" style="max-width: 300px;">
                             <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A Transistor</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>In this generation assembly languages and high level programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were used. Examples of computers in this generation include IBM 300 series and the ATLAS.</p>
                        <p>NB: A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power. The difference between a transistor and a vacuum tube is that a transistor uses a sandwich of silicon instead of tube filled with gas to do the switching. Silicon falls into a family of elements that are neither conductor nor insulator; they're called semiconductors. This type of element will be either a conductor or an insulator depending on some condition. In the case of transistors, an electrical current will cause the silicon to be a conductor.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="third-generation">Third Generation: 1965-1971.</h3>
                        <p>The third generation of computers is marked by the use of Integrated Circuits (IC's) in place of transistors. A single I.C has many transistors, resistors and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. The I.C was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable and efficient.</p>
                        <p>In this generation Remote processing, Time-sharing, Real-time, Multi-programming Operating System were used. High level language (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation</p>
                        <p>NB:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="fourth-generation">Fourth Generation: 1971-1980.</h3>
                        <p>The fourth generation of computers is marked by the use of Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements and their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation. Fourth Generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable. As a result, it gave rise to personal computer (PC) revolution.</p>
                        <p>In this generation Time sharing, Real time, Networks, Distributed Operating System were used. All the High level languages like C and C++, DBASE etc. were used in this generation</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="fifth-generation">Fifth Generation: 1980-todate.</h3>
                        <p>In the fifth generation, the VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components or more.</p>
                        <p>This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software.</p>
                        <p>AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which interprets means and method of making computers think like human beings. All the Higher level languages like C and C++, Java, .Net etc. are used in this generation</p>
