                        <p>A computer is an electronic device that accepts and processes data into information and under the control of instructions stored in its own memory and output or store the results for future use.</p>
                        <p>NB: An electronic device is a device that depends on the principles of electronics and uses the manipulation of electron flow for its operation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="definition-data">ii) Data</h3>
                        <p>Data are raw, unprocessed and unorganized (unstructured) facts and figures that are relatively meaningless to the user. E.g. number of hours worked by an employee.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="definition-information">iii) Information</h3>
                        <p>Information is derived from data. This is data that is processed, organized/structured and presented in a given context so as to make it useful. e,g., multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate to get each employee's gross earning. Information is an important component in decision making.</p>
                        <p>For example from a students test scores, the following information can be derived:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a)</span><span class="item-text">Class' average score</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text">Most improved student</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c)</span><span class="item-text">Median Score etc.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>(a) Decision-making</strong></p>
                        <p>When managers are ready to make choices (decisions) they need good, accurate and up-to-date information. If they act without relevant information it could lead to disaster, and failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>(b) Monitoring and control</strong></p>
                        <p>Businesses will compare actual performance against its predicted (budgeted) performance. Then they will act upon it.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="definition-ict">iv) Information Communication Technology/Technologies (ICT)</h3>
                        <p>ICT is an umbrella term that covers any software or hardware product that can store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit or receive information electronically in a digital form. Examples include personal computers, digital television, email, robots, radio, cellular phones and networking hardware.</p>
                        <p>For our study, we are concerned with computer (hardware and software) and telecommunications technology (data, image, and voice networks).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="definition-is">v) Information System (IS)</h3>
                        <p>An Information System (IS) is a combination of hardware, software, personnel, data and procedures that interact to support and improve day-to-day operations in an organization. These elements of an Information System are also known as the components of an Information System.</p>

                        <p>The Audit Commission has identified six key characteristics of good quality data.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="quality-accuracy">a) Accuracy</h3>
                        <p>Data should be sufficiently accurate for the intended use and should be captured only once, although it may have multiple uses. Data should be captured at the point of activity.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="quality-validity">b) Validity</h3>
                        <p>Data should be recorded and used in compliance with relevant requirements, including the correct application of any rules or definitions. This will ensure consistency between periods and with similar organizations, measuring what is intended to be measured.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="quality-timeliness">c) Timeliness</h3>
                        <p>Data should be captured as quickly as possible after the event or activity and must be available for the intended use within a reasonable time period. Data must be available quickly and frequently enough to support information needs and to influence service or management decisions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="quality-relevance">d) Relevance</h3>
                        <p>Data captured should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used. This will require a periodic review of requirements to reflect changing needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="quality-completeness">e) Completeness</h3>
                        <p>Data requirements should be clearly specified based on the information needs of the organization and data collection processes matched to these requirements.</p>
