                        <p>The two most popular types of network cabling are the 10BaseT (also known as twisted pair or Cat5), 10Base5 (also known as Thicknet) and thin coax (also known as 10Base2 or Thinnet). The "10" in 10Base5 stands for the 10 Mbps transmission rates while the "5" stands for the maximum distance of 500 meters to carry transmissions. The pairs are twisted together for the purposes of cancelling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources</p>
                        <p>10BaseT cabling looks like ordinary telephone wire, except that it has 8 wires inside instead of 4, transmits at 10 Mbps , with a maximum distance of 100 meters and physical star topology with a logical bus topology. There are basically two types of twisted-pair cabling: unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). UTP is simply twisted-pair cabling that is unshielded. In STP cables, each of the pair or collection of pair of wires that are twisted together are coated with an insulating coating that functions as a ground for the wires which protects the transmission line from electromagnetic interference leaking into or out of the cable.</p>
                        <p>Thin coax looks like the copper coaxial cabling that's often used to connect an aerial antenna to a TV set. The 10baseT/Cat5 cables have connectors that resemble a phone cord connector, only larger. These are called RJ-45 connectors. Coaxial cables are connected using BNC connectors.</p>

                        <p>NB: The BASE is for baseband operation. Baseband is an adjective that describes signals and systems whose range of frequencies is measured from close to 0 hertz to a cut-off frequency (a maximum bandwidth or highest signal frequency); it is sometimes used as a noun for a band of frequencies starting close to zero.</p>

                        <p>Fiber Optic Cables- signals are converted to light form and fired by laser or LEDs in bursts through insulated, thin glass or plastic fiber. Light bounces back and forth along the core. The pulses of light represent the 'on' state in electronic data representation. An optical fiber consists of a core (denser material) and a cladding (less dense material). In multi-mode fibres, as the name suggests, there are multiple modes of propagation for the rays of light. These range from low order modes which take the most direct route straight down the middle, to high order modes which take the longest route as they bounce from one side</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference</span>
                                <p>Although fiber optics can solve data communications problems, they are not needed everywhere. Most computer data goes over ordinary wires. Most data is sent over short distances at low speed. In ordinary environments, it is not practical to use fiber optics to transmit data between personal computers and printers as it's too costly. Electromagnetic Interference is a common type of noise that originates with one of the basic properties of electromagnetism. Magnetic field lines generate an electrical current as they cut across conductors. The flow of electrons in a conductor generates a magnetic field that changes with the current flow. Electromagnetic Interference does occur in coaxial cables, since current does cut across the conductor. Fiber optics are immune to this EMI since signals are transmitted as light instead of current. Thus, they can carry signals through places where EMI would block transmission.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Data Security</span>
                                <p>There are no radiated magnetic fields around optical fibers; the electromagnetic fields are confined within the fiber. That makes it impossible to tap the signal being transmitted through a fiber without cutting into the fiber. Since fiber optics do not radiate electromagnetic energy, emissions cannot be intercepted and physically tapping the fiber takes great skill to do undetected. Thus, the fiber is the most secure medium available for carrying sensitive data.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii.</span><span class="item-text">Non Conductive Cables</span>
                                <p>A serious concern with outdoor cables in certain computer networks is that they can be hit by lightning, causing destruction to wires and other cables that are involved in the network. Certain computer companies are aware of this problem and trying to solve it by having protective devices for wire circuits to block current and voltage surges. Any conductive cables can carry power surges or ground loops. Fiber optic cables can be made nonconductive by avoiding metal in their design. These kinds of cables are economical and standard for many indoor applications. Outdoor versions are more expensive since they require special strength members, but they can still be valuable in eliminating ground loops and protecting electronic equipment from surge damage.</p>

                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iv.</span><span class="item-text">Eliminating Spark Hazards</span>
                                <p>In some cases, transmitting signals electrically can be extremely dangerous. Most electric potentials create small sparks. The sparks ordinarily pose no danger, but can be really bad in a chemical plant or oil refinery where the air is contaminated with potentially explosive vapours. One tiny spark can create a big explosion. Potential spark hazards seriously hinder data and communication in such facilities. Fiber optic cables do not produce sparks since they do not carry current.</p>

                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">v.</span><span class="item-text">Ease Of Installation</span>
                                <p>Increasing transmission capacity of wire cables generally makes them thicker and more rigid. Such thick cables can be difficult to install in existing buildings where they must go through walls and cable ducts. Fiber cables are easier to install since they are smaller and more flexible. They can also run along the same routes as electric cables without picking up excessive noise.</p>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">vi.</span><span class="item-text">High Bandwidth Over Long Distances</span>
                                <p>Fiber optics have a large capacity to carry high speed signals over longer distances without repeaters than other types of cables. Generally, coaxial cables have a bandwidth parameter of a few MHz/km, where else the fiber optic cable has a bandwidth of 400 MHz/km.</p>

Hubs connect LANs of similar technology or to extend the distance of one LAN. They can be called repeaters or amplifiers.</p>

                        <p>The Switch is a more advanced unit over the basic hub. Unlike a hub, a switch will forward information/packets to the appropriate machine or port according to the address information on a particular packet. Switches are used on large networks in order to cut down the amount of unnecessary traffic being generated. They can use the same or different types of cable.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-servers">v. Servers</h3>
                        <p>A sever is a computer system that provides essential services across a network, to private users inside a large organization or to public users in the internet. They typically are configured with additional processing, memory and storage capacity to handle the load of servicing clients.</p>
                        <p>Servers offer networks the capability of centralizing the control of resources and can thus reduce administrative difficulties. Servers perform several tasks. For example, servers that provide files to the users on the network are called file servers. Likewise, servers that host printing services for users are called print servers.</p>
                        <p>Servers can be Dedicated Servers/single-purpose are assigned to provide specific applications or services for the network, and nothing else. For instance, a file server or print server. Non-dedicated Servers/multi-purpose servers are assigned to provide one or more network services and local access. For example, a server can be both a file server and a print server at the same time.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-noss">(g) Network Operating Systems (NOSs)</h3>
                        <p>PCs use a disk operating system that controls the file system and how the applications communicate with the hard disk. Networks use a network operating system (NOS) to control the communication with resources and the flow of data across the network. The NOS runs on the server. Some of the more popular network operating systems at this time include Unix, Novell's NetWare, and Microsoft's Windows NT Server (or Windows 2000).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-gateways">(h) Gateways:</h3>
                        <p>A gateway is a device used to connect networks using different protocols. Broadly, a gateway is any connection point or node on a network that provides access to a larger one and therefore a router is a gateway. They translate one network protocol and data formats to another. They can translate from network-to-network, system-to-network and system-to-system. Another example of gateway is a bridge.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-workstations">(i) Workstations/Client Computers/Terminal</h3>
                        <p>Workstations are the computers that the users on a network do their work on, performing activities such as word processing, database design, graphic design, e-mail, and other office or personal tasks. Workstations are basically nothing more than an everyday computer, except for the fact that they are connected to a network that offers additional resources. Workstations can range from a diskless computer system to a desktop system. In network terms, workstations are also known as client computers.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-repeaters">(k) Repeaters</h3>
                        <p>These are network devices used to regenerate or replicate a signal distorted by transmission loss. They allow a cabling system to extend beyond its maximum allowed length by amplifying the network voltages so they travel farther. Repeaters are like amplifiers and, as such, are inexpensive.</p>
                        <p>Repeaters can only be used to regenerate signals between similar network segments.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="network-component-bridges">(l) Bridges</h3>
                        <p>A bridge is a hardware device for linking two networks that work with the same protocol. Unlike a repeater, which works at the physical level, a bridge works at both the physical and the logical levels, which means that it can filter frames so that it only lets past data whose destination address corresponds to a machine located on the other side of the bridge.</p>

                        <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer, router) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are binary numbers, but they are usually stored in text files and displayed in human-readable dotted decimal notations, such as 172.16.254.1</p>
                        <p>An IP address has two components, the network address and the host address. For example, consider the IP address 150.215.017.009. Assuming this is part of a Class B network, the first two numbers (150.215) represent the Class B network address, and the second two numbers (017.009) identify a particular host/device on this network.</p>

You can "ping" an IP address to see if a machine is alive. If there is no response, you know something is wrong. E.g.</p>

                        <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-cmd">C: |> ping localhost</code></pre>
                        <p>Pings the local host, this will allow you to see if the computer is able to send information out and receive the information back. Note that this does not send information over a network but may allow you to see if the card is being seen.</p>
