Nodes can be connected using any of the various types of media, including twisted pair copper wire cable, optical fiber cable, coaxial cable and radio waves. The nodes in a network can be arranged according to several basic topologies (i.e., layouts).</p>

                        <p>The most commonly used topology in LANs is the star topology. All the nodes in a star topology are connected to a central device like a hub, a switch or a router with a point-to-point connection. The hub acts as a signal repeater. The hub or switch manages and controls all functions of the network. Star topologies can be implemented at home, offices or even in a building.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Bus topology uses a common backbone/trunk to connect all the network devices in a network in a linear layout. A single cable functions as the shared communication medium for all the devices attached to this cable with an interface connector or T-connector. The device, which wants to communicate, sends the message/signal to all the devices attached to the shared cable but only the intended recipient actually accepts the message. A terminator is added at both ends of the central cable, to prevent bouncing of signals. 10Base-2 and 10BaseT are two popular types of the Ethernet cables used in the Bus topology.</p>

                        <p>Tree topologies are comprised of multiple star topologies on a bus i.e. it is a bus/star hybrid topology. Only the hub devices can connect directly with the tree bus and each hub functions as the root of a tree for the network devices. The concentrator hub is a communications device that multiplexes (combines) several signals for transmission over a single medium.</p>

                        <p>This is a type of network in which devices are connected with many redundant interconnections between network nodes such as computers, routers and switches. Every node not only sends its own signals but also relays data from other nodes i.e. must collaborate to propagate the data in the network. Mesh topologies work on the concept of routes. The message sent to the destination can take any possible, shortest, easiest route to reach its destination. Mesh networks are typically wireless.</p>
                        <p>Routers work in finding the routes for the messages and in reaching them to their destinations. The topology in which every device connects to every other device is called a full Mesh topology unlike in a hybrid/partial mesh in which some nodes are connected to all the others, but some of the nodes are connected only to those other nodes with which they exchange the most data.</p>

                        <p>In a ring topology, all the nodes are connected to each other in such a way that they make a closed loop/ring. Each workstation is connected to two other components on either side and it communicates with these two adjacent neighbours. Data travels around the network in one direction and sending and receiving of data takes place by the help of a Token. A token contains a piece of information which is sent along with the data by the source computer. Once a node receives a packet, it sends a confirmation to the source machine. Each node gets to send data when it receives an empty token.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are three logical topologies (bus, ring, and switching) which are usually implemented as a physical star.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="logical-bus">LOGICAL BUS TOPOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Modern Ethernet networks are Star Topologies (physically) but logically they are bus topologies. The Hub is at the centre, and defines a Star Topology.</p>
                        <p>In any network, computers communicate by sending information across the media as a series of signals. In a logical bus topology, the signals travel along the length of the cable in all directions until they weaken enough so as not to be detectable or until they encounter a device that absorbs them. This traveling across the medium is called signal propagation</p>
                        <p>When a computer has data to send, it addresses that data, breaks it into manageable chunks, and sends it across the network as electronic signals</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">All computers on a logical bus receive them</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Only the destination computer accepts the data</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">All users must share the available amount of transmission time, implying network performance is reduced</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Collisions are bound to occur since all nodes are sharing same bus.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="logical-ring">LOGICAL RING TOPOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Data in a logical ring topology travels from one computer to the next computer until the data reaches its destination. Token passing is one method for sending data around a ring. A token is a small packet which passes around the ring to each computer in turn.</p>
                        <p>Logical ring can be implemented on a physical star. Modern logical ring topologies use smart hubs that recognize a computer's failure and remove the computer from the ring automatically. One advantage of the ring topology lies in its capability to share network resources fairly. The topology eliminates the chances of collision.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="logical-switching">SWITCHING</h3>
                        <p>A switch takes a signal coming from a device connected and builds a circuit on the fly to forward the signal to the intended destination computer.</p>
                        <p>Switching is superior to other logical topologies because unlike bus and ring, multiple computers can communicate simultaneously without affecting each other. Switching is the dominant logical topology in LAN design.</p>
                        <p>NB : Advantages and disadvantages of a certain topology depend on the following factors: Ease of management, Performance, Troubleshooting (maintenance), ease of design and implementation, safety of data, cost, expandability and robustness.</p>
