                        <p>The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private and public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast array of information resources and services, most notably the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support electronic mail.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="internet-history">History of the Internet</h3>
                        <p>In the 1960s, one of MIT's projects Mac was funded by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) of the department of defense. During one of its conferences, ARPA rolled out the blueprints for networking the main computers of about a dozen ARPA-funded universities institutions. They were to be connected with communication lines at then-stunning 56 Kbps . Shortly after the conference, ARPA proceeded to implement the ARPAnet, the predecessor of today's Internet.</p>
                        <p>Things worked out differently from what was originally planned. Rather than the primary benefit of researchers sharing each other's computer, it rapidly became clear that enabling the researchers to communicate among themselves via electronic mail (e-mail) was the key benefit of ARPAnet. One of the primary goals for ARPAnet was to allow multiple users to send and receive information simultaneously over the same communication paths. The network operated with a technique called packet switching, in which digital data was sent in small packages called packets. The packets contained data addresses, error control and sequencing information. The address information allowed packets to be routed to destinations. The sequencing information helped reassemble the packets into their original order for presentation to the recipient since they could arrive out of order.</p>
                        <p>The protocols for communicating over the ARPAnet became known as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP ensured that messages were properly routed from sender to receiver and that those messages arrived intact. As the internet evolved, organizations worldwide were implementing their own networks for both intraorganization and inter-organization communications. A wide variety of networking hardware and software appeared. One challenge was to get these networks to communicate. ARPA accomplished this with the development of IP - the Internetworking Protocol, truly creating a network of networks, the current architecture of the Internet. The combined set of protocols is now referred to as TCP/IP.</p>
                        <p>The history of the TCP/IP protocol suite can be traced back to one of the first WANs consisting of computers from different manufacturers running different operating systems. Before ARPAnet, most computer networks were homogeneous, consisting of computers from the same hardware manufacturer running the same operating system.</p>
                        <p>The ARPAnet's popularity became apparent, and in 1975, it was converted from an experimental research network into a fully operational network. Research into network protocols continued and the Internet Protocol Suite resulted. The TCP/IP protocols were adopted as Military Standards in 1983, and all computers connected to the ARPAnet were required to adopt the new protocol. The ARPAnet was then split into two networks: the MILNET, used for military communications, and the new, much smaller ARPAnet, used for further research. MILnet and ARPAnet together became known as the Internet. Initially, Internet use was limited to the universities, research institutions and the military, but eventually with time Internet has incorporated commercial applications.</p>
                        <p>The term internet (notice the lower case i) is now used to refer to any collection of physically separate networks that share the same communication protocols (not necessarily TCP/IP) to appear as a single logical network. The term Internet (notice the upper case I) is used to refer to the worldwide collection of interconnected computer networks that run the TCP/IP protocols.</p>
                        <p>Internetworking evolved as a solution to three key problems which are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                <p>It made electronic communication between different offices or departments impossible.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">Duplication of Resources</span>
                                <p>The same hardware and software had to be supplied to each office or department, as did separate support staff.</p>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii)</span><span class="item-text">Lack of Network Management</span>
                                <p>No centralized method of managing and troubleshooting networks existed.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="web-browsers">Web browsers</h4>
                        <p>Web browsers are software applications that are used to retrieve web pages from the Internet onto a device. They let you surf (or browse) through information on the Web. Information on the Web is structured into pages. Each page has a specific address that is used to locate and access information on that page.</p>
                        <p>The three browsers that particularly dominate the Internet market are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Microsoft's Internet Explorer</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Mozilla Firefox</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="modem">Modem (Modulator / Demodulator)</h4>
                        <p>On the Internet, computers exchange information via telephone lines. A modem is a device that enables you to connect to the Internet and access information through telephone wires. As a transmitting modem, it translates computer information into a form that can transmit over telephone lines (this is the process of modulation). As a receiving modem, it translates the information in a form that your computer can understand (this is the process of demodulation) i.e. from analogue to digital.</p>
                        <p>A fast modem is essential. It will reduce the amount of time spent waiting for web pages, files, or messages from the Internet. Modem speeds are quoted in 'bps' (bits per second).</p>
                        <p>Typical speeds are 9600 bps, 4.4 Kbps (Kilobits per second), 28.8 Kbps, 56 Kbps , etc.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="internet-service-provider">Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h4>
                        <p>This is a commercial organization that provides Internet connections, along with a set of support services for a fee.</p>
                        <p>Most people and organizations get a connection to the Internet over a telephone line through an ISP, though some larger businesses and institutions (such as universities) have their own internet connections.</p>
                        <p>An ISP will usually have a number of host computers. These hosts will typically provide storage space for electronic mail messages for their users, users' own web sites and a set of related facilities such as advice, support software and appropriate security.</p>
                        <p>Examples of local ISPs include Africa Online, Kenya Web, ISP Kenya, Swift Kenya and Inter-Connect.</p>
                        <p>When you open an account with an ISP you will be provided with a user name and a password:</p>
                        <p>Username - Every time you get connected, you require a name to identify yourself on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>Password - This is needed for security purposes. This ensures that your Internet account is secure.</p>
                        <p>NB: ISPs charge for the services rendered.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="world-wide-web">The World Wide Web</h4>
                        <p>The World Wide Web is also known as the Web, WWW or W3. The Web is a part of the Internet.</p>
                        <p>The WWW is a collection of hyperlinked web pages published on the Internet. This huge collection of documents is stored on computers, called hosts, around the world. The documents may contain text, pictures, sounds, small programs or forms to be completed by a user.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="web-page">Web Page</h4>
                        <p>Web pages are documents published on the Web by organizations and individuals interested in making themselves available online. Web pages can include text, pictures, sound and video.</p>
                        <p>Each web page has an address on the Internet. This address is called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Web pages are created using Hypertext Markup Language.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="web-site">Web Site</h4>
                        <p>A collection of web pages belonging to an organization or individual is called a website. These organizations or individuals maintain the website.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h4>
                        <p>These are links that connect one page to another which creates the World Wide Web. These links connect:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1:</span><span class="item-text">One web page to another part of the same web page. This is useful if it is a really large page.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2:</span><span class="item-text">One web page to another website somewhere on the Web.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3:</span><span class="item-text">A page to a file, such as a sound clip, video, a spreadsheet or a Word document etc.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These links to other pages can be links to objects stored anywhere on the Internet. Hypertext links are indicated by underlined text highlighted in blue (usually).</p>
                        <p>Hyperlinks are also represented by buttons, graphics or pictures.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="web-hosting">Web Hosting</h4>
                        <p>A World Wide Web server is a computer with programs that answer requests for documents from clients (browsers) over the Internet. Files containing web sites are placed on these servers also known as host computers. A host computer is any computer connected to the Internet and has stored information that has been made available to the Web.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="home-page">Home Page</h4>
                        <p>The Home page is the web page loaded when Internet Explorer is first started i.e. when you access the Web. You can set any web page as your home page.</p>
                        <p>The home page is also the first page of a company or an individual's website on the Web.</p>
                        <p>Note: Do not confuse your home page with the home page of the websites you visit. Your home page is set through Internet Explorer.</p>
                        <p>The home page of a website is the introductory page for the site.</p>
                        <p>If you click a hyperlink such as Home on a web page, you will jump to the website's home page, not yours.</p>
                        <p>To access your home page, click the Home button on the Explorer toolbar.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="web-address">Web Address (Uniform Resource Locator (URL))</h4>
                        <p>Each web page has a unique address or location, called the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</p>
                        <p>You can instantly display any Web page if you know its URL. For example, http://www.compaq.com You can include wildcards in a URL in cases when you may not know the full path. For example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>http://www.mars.superlink.net/~zorro/humor.com</code></pre>
                        <p>The wild card ( ~ ) is used to represent character(s). In the above example, sites that have Azorro, Thezorro etc instead of ~ Zorro will be displayed.</p>
                        <p>A wrongly entered character can result in an invalid URL, e.g. a comma instead of a full stop or a dash instead of an underscore.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="search-engines">Search Engines/Search Services.</h4>
                        <p>A search engine is software that helps you locate information in the Web. There are several search engines such as Google search engine, Yahoo, Infoseek, Lycos, Web Crawler, and Excite that offer different kinds of searching capabilities.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>With the number of businesses that are connecting to the Internet and using cable modems, DSL lines, and T1 circuits, the need to secure their connections is not only necessary but also simply due diligence on the part of the company. Businesses rely on their Internet connection to send credit card payments through, to run their VoIP phones, and even to host their webpage. If Internet connectivity is disrupted then business can not operate as usual.</p>
                        <p>In order to insure that the connection to the Internet is secure there are some basic methods that can be utilized that are fairly cheap and will more than pay for themselves with the increased security and uptime of the Internet connection. A business does not need to make sure their network is as tight as an Army base; they just need to make sure they are more secure than others so that attackers will target the easier sites and leave theirs alone.</p>
                        <p>The very first thing that needs to be put in place at each and every Internet connection is a firewall. All businesses should have a hardware firewall that protects and separates their business from the Internet. A cable modem with built-in firewall may be adequate for a household, but a business should look at a commercially available firewall such as a Juniper firewall 5 series, a SonicWall firewall, or even a Cisco SOHO. These are all inexpensive and are easy to manage and configure. A firewall is the first step of protection that keeps out those who do not need to have access to the internal business network. Essentially installing a firewall is similar to installing locks on a house. Only those with the proper keys can access the house just as only those who have been specifically granted access can access the network behind the firewall.</p>
                        <p>Once a firewall has been installed, configured, and is working properly a business is going to want to look at the computers themselves. There are two things that need to be done on all the machines that will insure that the machines stay up and operational longer than those that are left unprotected. The two things are necessary are: patching the machines for the latest updates for both the operating system (OS) and the applications, and then installing antivirus software.</p>
                        <p>The patching of the systems will insure that the vulnerabilities that virus/worm writers are using to exploit and take over machines will not be effective against a patched machine. By patching the machine the entry door is closed and the worm will not be able to gain access. Application patches update their tools and software being used on the machine. With the latest patches this too will make it more difficult for attackers to exploit machines and gain entry to them.</p>
                        <p>Antivirus software is an absolute necessity on machines. System administrators and users can become annoyed with it as it is a resource hog but that is because the software is tasked with protecting the system and they continually scan the system for infections. When used in "real-time" mode each file is scanned before downloading, uploading, or being saved to the disk. This is important when reading emails, sending emails, or even surfing on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>There are many other steps that can be taken to give a business a stricter security posture. However, by taking the above steps a business can rest assured that they have taken the due diligence and installed the most basic security measures in their business that will make it difficult for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a business's network.</p>
