This can be supplemented by external cache memory fitted on the motherboard and referred to as Level-2 cache memory or secondary cache.</span></li>

                                <p>ROM chips, the contents, or combination of electrical circuit states, are set by the manufacturer and cannot be changed. States are permanently manufactured into the chip.</p>

                                <p>Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM): An EPROM is a ROM that can be erased and reprogrammed. A little glass window is installed on top of the ROM package, through which you can actually see the chip that holds the memory. Ultraviolet light of a specific frequency can be shined through this window for a specified period of time, which will erase the EPROM and allow it to be reprogrammed again. These chips are usually easily identified by their small, circular windows.</p>

                                <p>Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM): The next level of erasability is the EEPROM, which can be erased under software control. This is the most flexible type of ROM, and is now commonly used for holding BIOS programs. When you hear reference to a "flash BIOS" or doing a BIOS upgrade by "flashing", this refers to reprogramming the BIOS EEPROM with a special software program. This is not a contradiction of what "read-only" really means, but the rewriting is done maybe once a year or so, compared to real read-write memory (RAM) where rewriting is done often many times per second. Flash memory was derived from EEPROM.</p>
                                <p>It is very inconvenient to remove an IC every time it needs to have the software it contains upgraded. EEPROM chips can be erased by sending a special sequence of electric signals to the chip while it is still in the circuit. These signals then erase all or part of the chip.</p>

                                <p>Internal storage allows the data and applications to be loaded very rapidly into memory, ready for use. The data can be accessed much faster than data which is stored on an external storage device. This is because internal storage devices are connected directly to the motherboard and its data bus whereas external devices are connected through a hardware interface such as USB, which means they are considerably slower to access.</p>
                                <p>Internal storage also means that if the computer is moved around, it will still retain its most frequently used data. The main disadvantage of internal storage is that when the hard disk fails, all the data and applications may be lost. This can be avoided to some extent by using more than one hard disk within the machine. Each hard disk has a copy of all the data, so if one fails the other can carry on. This is called a RAID array. An alternative is to use external media for backup. An example of internal storage media is an internal/fixed hard disk.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" id="optical-bluray">3. Blu-Ray Disc</h5>
                        <p>Blu-ray Disc (BD) is a digital optical disc data storage format designed to supersede the DVD format. The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional (pre-BD-XL) Blu-ray Discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs ( 50 GB ) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple layer discs ( 100 GB ) and quadruple layers ( 128 GB ) are available for BDXL re-writer drives. The name Blu-ray Disc refers to the blue laser used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The major application of Blu-ray Discs is as a medium for video material such as feature films.</p>
                        <p>The Blu-ray disc overcomes DVD-reading issues by placing the data on top of a <strong>1.1-mm-thick polycarbonate layer</strong>. Having the data on top prevents birefringence and therefore prevents readability problems. And, with the recording layer sitting closer to the objective lens of the reading mechanism, the problem of disc tilt is virtually eliminated. Because the data is closer to the surface, a hard coating is placed on the outside of the disc to protect it from scratches and fingerprints.</p>

                        <p>Flash memory and pen drives are very common today. Flash memory is also known as a solid state storage device because there are no moving parts and therefore less susceptible to mechanical damage. They are also small in physical size and light in weight therefore portable. Flash memory also transfers data at a faster rate than optical and magnetic media. They are useful in devices where frequent updating of data is required. Flash memory is usually found in digital cameras, digital camcorders and mobile phones.</p>

                        <p>A storage medium (media is the plural) is the physical material on which data items are kept. A storage device is the computer hardware that records and retrieves items to and from a storage medium. Storage devices can function as sources of input and output. When storage devices transfer items from a storage medium into memory - a process called reading - they function as sources of input. When storage devices transfer items from memory to a storage medium - a process called writing - they function as sources of output. Sometimes the storage medium is removable from the device, e.g. a CD-ROM can be taken out of a CD drive. Types of storage media include floppy disks, hard disks, compact discs, tape, PC Cards, microfilm, and microfiche.</p>

Network cards act as the physical connection between the computer and the network media. Every NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address and because an NIC's MAC address is permanent, it's often referred to as the "real," or physical, address of a computer. NICs are built into the motherboard of most new computers integrated into the motherboard chipset or implemented via a low-cost dedicated Ethernet chip.</p>
