                        <p>One of the common services provided by the Internet is electronic mail, also known as e-mail. This is a worldwide system for sending and receiving electronic messages from one computer to another.</p>
                        <p>E-mail is a much faster, economical and convenient way of sending messages to family, friends and colleagues than the old fashioned mail called "snail mail". With "snail mail" a message or letter is sent to the recipient through the post office and takes days or weeks before reaching the destination. An e-mail message can travel around the world in minutes.</p>
                        <p>For one to be able to communicate using email, the following components are needed:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1)</span><span class="item-text">A computer where you will send or receive the e-mail messages.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2)</span><span class="item-text">Your e-mail address and that of the receiver.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3)</span><span class="item-text">An ISP company who will deliver your message to the receiver.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4)</span><span class="item-text">An e-mail program that lets you send, receive and manage your e-mail messages, e.g. Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Lotus Notes, Eudora.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Once you send a letter, it travels from your computer, through a modem, which connects your computer to the Internet via the telephone network. The mail travels through various computers, until it reaches the final destination.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="email-system-imap">2. IMAP</h3>
                        <p>IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. It's an alternative to POP3 which keeps messages stored on a central business email server, along with information about whether each message has been read or replied to.</p>
                        <p>With IMAP, you can log in from any computer and see your whole inbox, complete with the status of messages - so you can see which you've read, which you've replied to, and so on.</p>
                        <p>IMAP is a good way to add extra flexibility to your business email. It's a well-established technology and you'll find many entry-level email services (like those from web hosting companies) will include IMAP as standard.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="email-system-exchange">3. Microsoft Exchange</h3>
                        <p>The majority of companies use Exchange Server to store email and Outlook as the client. Like IMAP, Exchange stores messages centrally, so you can log in from different places. But it also offers lots of extra functions, including centrally stored calendars, task and contact lists.</p>
                        <p>Exchange and Outlook integrate well with Windows, but make less sense in a mixed environment with many Apple desktops and iPhone / Android mobile users. Often used to create a closed email environment out of security concerns, where it can be hard to get your email to outside systems.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="email-system-webmail">4. Webmail or HTTP</h3>
                        <p>As the name suggests, webmail services require you to use a web browser (like Internet Explorer or Firefox) to log in and access your business email. Some people call them HTTP email services.</p>
                        <p>Many free business email services - including Hotmail, Yahoo Mail and Google Mail - are webmail services.</p>
                        <p>To send or receive email, you visit a specific website and log in with your username and password.</p>
                        <p>Webmail is convenient because you can log in from anywhere. However, it's useless unless you're connected to the internet, meaning most companies prefer to use another business email service which also offers webmail as an option.</p>
                        <p>For instance, Microsoft Exchange includes a webmail interface, so you can check your business email if you're not at your own computer. So do many of the IMAP and POP3-based services available.</p>

For example, if you send a message To: johndoe@yahoo.com and Bcc: janedoe@yahoo.com, then johndoe will see himself as the message's only recipient, while janedoe will see that you have also sent the message to johndoe.

                        <p>Documents that contain file attachments display a paper clip image in the view or folder next to the document title.</p>
                        <p>Once the document is open, Outlook displays an icon representing the attachment.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">In the Inbox, select the message that contains the attachment and open it.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Double-click the icon that represents the attachment.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>You must have the application in which the attachment was composed in order to open it. The MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type of file enables Internet browsers to access an Internet mail file without prompting the user to specify the program used to create the attached file.</p>
                        <p>As a precaution, do not open file attachments unless you are sure you know where they came from. There have been several cases of entire hard disks getting damaged due to viruses sent via e-mails. Examples of email viruses are 'Melissa', 'Bugbear', 'Sasser' etc.</p>
