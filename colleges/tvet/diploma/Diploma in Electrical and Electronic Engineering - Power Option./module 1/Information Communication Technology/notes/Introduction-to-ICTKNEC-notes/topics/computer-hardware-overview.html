                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hardware refers to the physical, tangible computer equipment and devices, which provide support for major functions such as input, processing (computation and control), output, secondary storage (for data and programs), and communication.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-015-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of a computer system with system unit, monitor, keyboard, and mouse" class="content-image">
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">System Unit</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The system unit is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor, which acts as the "brain" of your computer. Another component is random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off.</p>
                        <p>Almost every other part of your computer connects to the system unit using cables. The cables plug into specific ports (openings), typically on the back of the system unit. Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a peripheral device. Peripheral devices can be external such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner or internal, such as a CD-ROM drive, CD-R drive or internal modem. Internal peripheral devices are often referred to as integrated peripherals. There are two types according to shape: tower and desktop.</p>
                        <p>A motherboard (mainboard, system board, planar board or logic board) is the main printed circuit board found in computers and other expandable systems. It holds many of the crucial electronic components of the system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.</p>
                        <p>The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a high speed connection to the motherboard for video cards. The AGP port is faster than a PCI card and doesn't use the system memory.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="power-supply">The Power Supply</h3>
                        <p>Power supplies, often referred to as "switching power supplies", use switcher technology to convert the AC input to lower DC voltages, a form that is usable by the Personal computer. The typical voltages supplied are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">3.3 volts</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">5 volts</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">12 volts</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 3.3 - and 5 -volts are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12 -volt is used to run motors in disk drives and fans. The main specification of a power supply is in watts.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="uninterruptible-power-supply">Uninterruptible Power Supply</h3>
                        <p>An uninterruptible power supply, also uninterruptible power source, UPS or battery/flywheel backup is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source, typically mains power, fails. The device allows the computer to keep running for at least a short time when the primary power source is lost. It also provides protection from power surges. A UPS contains a battery that "kicks in" when the device senses a loss of power from the primary source.</p>

                        <p>Most computers cannot accept data in forms customary to human communication such as speech or handwritten documents. It is necessary, therefore, to present data to the computer in a way that provides easy conversion into its own electronic pulse-based forms. This is commonly achieved by typing data using the keyboard or using an electronic mouse or any other input device.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="input-keyboard">a) THE KEYBOARD</h3>
                        <p>Keyboard (similar to a typewriter) is the main input device of a computer (refer to figure 2.2). It contains three types of keys-- alphanumeric keys, special keys and function keys. Alphanumeric keys are used to type all alphabets, numbers and special symbols like $, %, @, A etc. Special keys such as <Shift>, <Ctrl>, <Alt>, <Home>, <Scroll Lock> etc. are used for special functions. Function keys such as <Fl>, <F2>, <F3> etc. are used to give special commands depending upon the software used e.g.F5 reloads a page of an internet browser. The function of each and every key can be well understood only after working on a PC. When any key is pressed, an electronic signal is produced. This signal is detected by a keyboard encoder that sends a binary code corresponding to the key pressed to the CPU. There are many types of keyboards but 101 keys keyboard is the most popular one.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="keyboard-organization">How the keys are organized</h4>
                        <p>The keys on your keyboard can be divided into several groups based on function:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Typing (alphanumeric) keys. These keys include the same letter, number, punctuation, and symbol keys found on a traditional typewriter.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Special (Control) keys. These keys are used alone or in combination with other keys to perform certain actions. The most frequently used control keys are CTRL, ALT, the Windows key #, and ESC.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Function keys. The function keys are used to perform specific tasks. They are labelled as F1, F2, F3, and so on, up to F12. The functionality of these keys differs from program to program.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Cursor Movement (Navigation) keys. These keys are used for moving around in documents or WebPages and editing text. They include the arrow keys, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, DELETE, and INSERT and ARROW KEYS.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Numeric keypad. The numeric keypad is handy for entering numbers quickly. The keys are grouped together in a block like a conventional calculator or adding machine.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                         <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-018-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing sections of a standard keyboard layout" class="content-image">

                        <p>The above illustration shows how these keys are arranged on a typical keyboard. Your keyboard layout may differ.</p>
                        <p>Exercise: With the help of your tutor, identify all the keys in each of the categories listed above and their general tasks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="input-mouse">b) THE MOUSE</h3>
                        <p>A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail and the connector which can either be PS/2 or USB. Some newer mice are wireless.</p>
                        <p>A mouse usually has two buttons: a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button. Many mice also have a wheel between the two buttons, which allows you to scroll smoothly through screens of information. When you move the mouse with your hand, a pointer on your screen moves in the same direction. (The pointer's appearance might change depending on where it's positioned on your screen.) When you want to select an item, you point to the item and then click (press and release) the primary button. Pointing and clicking with your mouse is the main way to interact with your computer. There are several types of mice: Mechanical mouse, optical mouse, optical-mechanical mouse and laser mouse.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-parts">Basic parts</h4>
                        <p>A mouse typically has two buttons: a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button (usually the right button). The primary button is the one you will use most often. Most mice also include a scroll wheel between the buttons to help you scroll through documents and WebPages more easily. On some mice, the scroll wheel can be pressed to act as a third button. Advanced mice might have additional buttons that can perform other functions.</p>
                         <figure>

                        <p>Place your mouse beside your keyboard on a clean, smooth surface, such as a mouse pad. Hold the mouse gently with your index finger resting on the primary button and you thumb resting on the side. To move the mouse, slide it slowly in any direction. Don't twist it-keep the front of the mouse aimed away from you. As you move the mouse, a pointer (see picture) on your screen moves in the same direction. If you run out of room to move your mouse on your desk or mouse pad, just pick up the mouse and bring it back closer to you.</p>
                        <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-019-3.jpg" alt="Illustration showing a straight wrist position when holding a mouse" class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-actions">Pointing, clicking, and dragging</h4>
                        <p>Pointing to an item on the screen means moving your mouse so the pointer appears to be touching the item. When you point to something, a small box often appears that describes the item. For example, when you point to the Recycle Bin on the desktop, a box appears with this information: "Contains the files and folders that you have deleted."</p>
                         <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-020-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing mouse pointer hovering over Recycle Bin with a descriptive tooltip" class="content-image">
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Pointing to an object often reveals a descriptive message about it</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The pointer can change depending on what you're pointing at. For example, when you point to a link in your web browser, the pointer changes from an arrow has a hand with a pointing finger</p>
                        <p>Most mouse actions combine pointing with pressing one of the mouse buttons. There are four basic ways to use your mouse buttons: clicking, double-clicking, right-clicking, and dragging.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-clicking">Clicking (single-clicking)</h4>
                        <p>To click an item, point to the item on the screen, and then press and release the primary button (usually the left button).</p>
                        <p>Clicking is most often used to select (mark) an item or open a menu. This is sometimes called single-clicking or left-clicking.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-double-clicking">Double-clicking</h4>
                        <p>To double-click an item, point to the item on the screen, and then click twice quickly. If the two clicks are spaced too far apart, they might be interpreted as two individual clicks rather than as one double-click.</p>
                        <p>Double-clicking is most often used to open items on your desktop. For example, you can start a program or open a folder by double-clicking its icon on the desktop.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-right-clicking">Right-clicking</h4>
                        <p>To right-click an item, point to the item on the screen, and then press and release the secondary button (usually the right button).</p>
                        <p>Right-clicking an item usually displays a list of things you can do with the item. For example, when you right-click the Recycle Bin on your desktop, Windows displays a menu allowing you to open it, empty it, delete it, or see its properties. If you are unsure of what to do with something, right-click it.</p>
                         <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_12b4341ee1eb32034ac6g-021-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the context menu after right-clicking the Recycle Bin" class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="mouse-dragging">Dragging</h4>
                        <p>You can move items around your screen by dragging them. To drag an object, point to the object on the screen, press and hold the primary button, move the object to a new location, and then release the primary button.</p>

                                <p>This type of mouse contains a round ball that makes contact with two rollers-one for the x-axis (the horizontal) and one for the y-axis (the vertical). Moving the mouse causes the ball to roll, and because the ball is in contact with the two rollers, it causes them to turn. These rollers are connected to wheels with small holes in them. Each wheel rotates between the arms of a U-shaped optical sensor. The holes allow a light to shine through the wheel onto the optical sensor in flashes as the wheel turns. By the speed and patterns of the light pulses, the mouse senses the speed and direction it is moving and sends its interpretation of those movements to the computer and the mouse control software.</p>
