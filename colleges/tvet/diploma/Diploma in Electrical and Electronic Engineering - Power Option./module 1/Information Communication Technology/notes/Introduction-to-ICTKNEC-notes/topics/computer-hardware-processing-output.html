The arithmetic/logic unit can perform four kinds of arithmetic operations, or mathematical calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As its name implies, the arithmetic/logic unit also performs logical operations. A logical operation is usually a comparison. It also does branching on prefixed conditions.</p>

                        <p>Registers are temporary (volatile) storage areas for instructions or data inside the CPU and that can keep with the processor. Registers work under the direction of the control unit to accept, hold, and transfer instructions or data and perform arithmetic or logical comparisons at high speed.</p>
                        <p>Computers usually assign special roles to certain registers, including these registers:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="cpu-buses">- CPU Buses:</h4>
                        <p>these components are the information highway for the CPU. Buses are bundles of tiny wires that carry data and instructions between components. The three most important buses are the address, the data, and the control buses.</p>
                        <p>An address bus is a computer bus (a series of lines connecting two or more devices) that is used to specify a physical address. When a processor or DMA-enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location, it specifies that memory location on the address bus (the value to be read or written is sent on the data bus).</p>
                        <p>A control bus is (part of) a computer bus, used by CPUs for communicating with other devices within the computer. While the address bus carries the information on which device the CPU is communicating with and the data bus carries the actual data being processed, the control bus carries commands from the CPU and returns status signals from the devices.</p>

                        <p>Primary storage, also called main memory, although not a part of the CPU, is closely related to the CPU. Main memory holds portions of the operating system, program instructions and data before and after execution by the CPU. All instructions and data pass through main memory locations. Memory is located physically close to the CPU to reduce access time, that is, the time it takes the CPU to retrieve data from memory. Although the overall trend has been increased memory access time, memory has not advanced as quickly as processors. Memory access time is often measured in milliseconds, or one thousandths of a second.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="processing-cache-memory">iii) CACHE MEMORY</h3>
                        <p>A CPU cache is a type of memory used by the central processing unit of a computer to reduce the average time to access memory. The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. Most CPUs have an internal cache memory (in-built in the processor) which is referred to as Level 1 (L1) cache. This can be supplemented by external cache memory fitted on the motherboard and referred to as Level-2 cache memory or secondary cache.</p>
                        <p>Cache memory uses SRAM chips.</p>
                        <p>NB/ Some computers come equipped with COPROCESSORS. A coprocessor is a special-purpose processing unit that assists the CPU in performing certain types of operations. For example, a math coprocessor performs mathematical computations, particularly floating-point operations. Math coprocessors are also called numeric and floating-point coprocessors.</p>
                        <p>Most computers come with a floating-point coprocessors built in. Note, however, that the program itself must be written to take advantage of the coprocessor. If the program contains no coprocessor instructions, the coprocessor will never be utilized.</p>
                        <p>In addition to math coprocessors, there are also graphics coprocessors for manipulating graphic images. These are often called accelerator boards.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="processing-gpu">(ii) Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3>
                        <p>A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images for output to a display. The GPU is the part of the Video Adaptor Card that makes it work.</p>
                        <p>Used primarily for 3-D applications, a graphics processing unit is a single-chip processor that creates lighting effects and transforms objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn. These are mathematically-intensive tasks, which otherwise, would put quite a strain on the CPU. Lifting this burden from the CPU frees up cycles that can be used for other jobs.</p>

Both commands and data were represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Characters are coded onto an 80 -column card in columns by combining punches in different locations; a special card reader reads the cards and translates them into transactions for the computer. These are now used only for older applications. Early digital computers also used punched cards, often prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.</p>

                        <p>Impact printers create an image by using some mechanism to physically press an inked ribbon against the page, causing the ink to be deposited on the page in the shape desired. These printers are typically loud, but remain in use today because of their unique ability to function with multipart forms. Multipart forms are sheets of paper with embedded carbon paper so that printing on the top sheet provides several copies simultaneously when the multiple parts are split.</p>

                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading" id="printer-dot-matrix">a) Dot matrix printers</h6>
                        <p>Dot matrix printers which use a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. The print head typically has 9 or 24 pins. Each character is made from a matrix of dots. The images are relatively of poor quality since dots are visible upon close inspection. They are inexpensive to buy compared to other types and have one of the lowest printing costs per page. They are, however, noisy and low-end models are slow (speed varies with price).</p>

                         <h6 class="subsubsection-heading" id="printer-daisy-wheel">b) Daisy wheel printers</h6>
                        <p>The daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out in relief along the outer edge. To print a character, the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper. Then a hammer strikes the disk, forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon, leaving an impression of the character on the paper. You can change the daisy wheel to print different fonts.</p>
                        <p>Daisy-wheel printers cannot print graphics, and in general they are noisy and slow, printing from 10 to about 75 characters per second. As the price of laser and ink-jet printers has declined, and the quality of dot-matrix printers has improved, daisy-wheel printers have become obsolete.</p>

They offer relatively good image quality with so many small dots that they are not noticeable, even upon close inspection. They are relatively quiet compared to dot matrix and most can print colour images. They are the most commonly used.</p>

                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading" id="printer-laserjet">b) Laser jet printers</h6>
                        <p>They form images using copier technology. When a document is sent to the printer, a laser beam "draws" the document on a selenium-coated drum using electrical charges. After the drum is charged, it is rolled in toner, a dry powder type of ink. The toner adheres to the charged image on the drum. The toner is transferred onto a piece of paper and fused to the paper with heat and pressure. After the document is printed, the electrical charge is removed from the drum and the excess toner is collected. These printers have excellent image quality - so many small dots that they are not noticeable, even upon close inspection. They are quieter than ink jet printers.</p>

                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading" id="printer-thermal">c) Thermal Printers</h6>
                        <p>Thermal printing produces a printed image by selectively heating coated thermo-chromic paper (paper that is coated with a chemical that changes color when exposed to heat), or thermal paper as it is commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. It is very quiet and not widely used by home PC users. Some very expensive colour models are available. "Ink" in these computers is wax crayons.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="output-plotters">C) PLOTTERS</h3>
                        <p>Printers make images one line at a time and move from top to bottom during the printing process. Plotters, on the other hand, draw the image as humans would, with a pen; one shape at a time. Plotters are most often used with CAD software to produce blueprints or technical diagrams. It would be quite expensive to make a printer that can print on paper as wide as these drawings require. Because a plotter uses a pen (or several pens in a holder) on a cable carrier, it is easy (and relatively inexpensive) to make a very wide plotter.</p>
                        <p>Plotters are typically used for design output. They are special-purpose output devices used to produce charts, maps, architectural drawings and three-dimensional representations. They can produce high-quality multi-colour documents or large size documents. Plotters produce documents such as blueprints or schematics.</p>
                        <p>In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, though they have generally been replaced with wide-format conventional printers.</p>

                        <p>Output device for soft-copy output (temporal screen display of output which lasts as long as the monitor's power is on). They are the most frequently used output devices. Some are used on the desktop; others are portable. Two important characteristics of the monitor are size and clarity.</p>
                        <p>A monitor displays information in visual form, using text and graphics. The portion of the monitor that displays the information is called the screen. Like a television screen, a computer screen can show still or moving pictures.</p>
                        <p>The monitor forms images from tiny dots, called pixels. Pixels are arranged in a rectangular form. The sharpness of image (screen resolution) depends upon the number of pixels. There are several types of monitors:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="monitor-crt">CRT MONITORS</h4>
                        <p>The cathode ray tube (CRT) technology uses a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images. It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images.</p>

                        <p>Short for thin film transistor, a type of LCD flat-panel display screen, in which each pixel is controlled by from one to four transistors. The TFT technology provides the best resolution of all the flat-panel techniques, but it is also the most expensive.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="monitor-lcd">LCD MONITORS</h4>
                        <p>Short for liquid crystal display, a type of display used in digital watches and many portable computers. LCD displays utilize two sheets of polarizing material with a liquid crystal solution between them. An electric current passed through the liquid causes the crystals to align so that light cannot pass through them. Each crystal, therefore, is like a shutter, either allowing light to pass through or blocking the light.</p>

                        <p>An LED display is a flat panel display, which uses light-emitting diodes as a video display.</p>

                        <p>A type of flat-panel display that works by sandwiching a neon/xenon gas mixture between two sealed glass plates with parallel electrodes deposited on their surfaces. The plates are sealed so that the electrodes form right angles, creating pixels. When a voltage pulse passes between two electrodes, the gas breaks down and produces weakly ionized plasma, which emits UV radiation. The UV radiation activates colour phosphors and visible light is emitted from each pixel.</p>

                        <p>Voice-output devices make sounds that resemble human speech. Voice-output devices use pre-recorded vocalized sounds to produce output. The computer "speaks" synthesized words. Voice output is not as difficult to create as voice input. Most widely used voice-output devices are stereo speakers and headphones. Devices are connected to a sound card in the system unit. Sound card is used to capture sound as well as play it back.</p>
