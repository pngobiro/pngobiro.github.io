                        <p>Data security refers to protecting data from destructive forces and unwanted actions of unauthorized users. Data needs to be protected from loss through accidental or malicious deletion, virus attacks hard disk or system failures, unauthorized access etc. Methods of protecting data include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i)</span><span class="item-text">Use of passwords (Access Authentication): A password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication/verification before the user can gain access to data. The password should be kept secret from those not allowed access. Passwords are used together with usernames by users in a log-in process that controls access to protected system data.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">Right of Access refers to the authorization you have to access different data files. Right of access helps determines who has the right to do what in relation to certain data or information. For example, database administrators may be able to remove, edit and add data while a general user may not have the right to do the same. Right of access in an organization is usually given/ specified by the system or database administrators.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii)</span><span class="item-text">Logs and Audit trails: An audit trail is a record showing who has accessed a computer system, when and what operations he or she has performed during a given period of time. An audit trail can also maintain a record of activity by the system itself. Audit trails are useful both for maintaining data security and for recovering lost transactions.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iv)</span><span class="item-text">Anti-virus programs are software used to prevent, detect and remove malicious software such as viruses which can interfere with or lead to the loss of data stored on a computer. A virus or a malware in general is software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt computer operations or gain access to private computer systems in order to steal or destroy sensitive information of personal, financial or business importance. Examples of anti-virus software include Norton, AVG, Kaspersky etc.</span></li>

The Act created a Commission-Freedom of Information Commission of Kenya-with the mandate of ensuring the implementation of the Act, to receive complaints regarding violations of the Act, institute legal proceedings and settlement concerning such violations. The Act, however, only applies to personal information held by public authorities and excludes private bodies.</p>
                                <p>The act contains eight data protection principles. The principles specify that personal data must be:</p>

This means installing two disk drives and an equal number of drive controllers such that when the computer writes data on one drive, it automatically writes that data to the other drives and therefore offers synchronized copies on several drives. If one drive fails, the system swaps the failed drive for a new one, ensuring continuity. The problem with mirroring is that if a deletion occurs in one disk, the same will be deleted in the mirror back-up. The disks can be installed on the same machine or over long distance.</span></li>

Typically the storage medium is located offsite and connected to the backup source by a network or Internet connection. It does not involve human intervention to plug in drives and storage media for backups to run. Many commercial data centres now offer this as a subscription service to consumers. The storage data centres are located away from the source being backed up and the data is sent from the source to the storage data centre securely over the Internet. Data is sent electronically via a remote backup service, which is known as electronic vaulting or e-vaulting.</span></li>

                                        <p>Remote backups are a form of offsite backup with a difference being that you can access, restore or administer the backups while located at your source location or other location. You do not need to be physically present at the backup storage facility to access the backups. For example, putting your backup hard drive at your bank safe deposit box would not be considered a remote backup. You cannot administer it without making a trip to the bank. Online backups are usually considered remote backups as well.</p>
