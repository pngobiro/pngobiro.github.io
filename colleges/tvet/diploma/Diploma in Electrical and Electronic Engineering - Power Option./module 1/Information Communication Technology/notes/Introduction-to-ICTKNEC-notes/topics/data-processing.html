                        <p>There are several data-collection techniques that allow us to systematically collect data and include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Using available information</span>
                                <p>Usually there is a large amount of data that has already been collected by others, although it may not necessarily have been analyzed or published. Locating these sources and retrieving the information is a good starting point in any data collection effort.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Observing</span>
                                <p>This is being part of the system where the person collecting data systematically selects, watches and records specific situation or type of situations.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Interviewing (face-to-face)</span>
                                <p>An interview is a data-collection technique that involves oral questioning of respondents, either individually or as a group.</p>
                                <p>Answers to the questions posed during an interview can be recorded by writing them down (either during the interview itself or immediately after the interview) or by recording the responses, or by a combination of both.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>A written questionnaire (also referred to as self-administered questionnaire) is a data collection tool in which written questions are presented that are to be answered by the respondents in written form.</p>
                                <p>A written questionnaire can be administered in different ways, such as by:</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                </ul>
                                <p>The questions can be either open-ended or closed (with pre-categorised answers).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Focus group discussions</span>
                                <p>A focus group discussion allows a group of 8-12 informants to freely discuss a certain subject with the guidance of a facilitator or reporter.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="dpc-data-input">2. DATA INPUT</h3>
                        <p>It is the process through which collected data is transformed into a form that the computer can understand. It is a very important step because correct output result totally depends on the input data. In this stage, the following activities are to be performed.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-input-verification">i) Verification</h4>
                        <p>The collected data is verified to determine whether it is correct as required. If errors occur in collected data, data is corrected or it is collected again.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-input-coding">ii) Coding</h4>
                        <p>The verified data is coded or converted into machine readable form so that it can be processed through computer.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-input-storing">iii) Storing</h4>
                        <p>The data is stored on the secondary storage into a file. The stored data on the storage media will be given to the program as input for processing.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="dpc-data-processing-storage">3. DATA PROCESSING AND STORAGE</h3>
                        <p>The main purpose of data processing is to get the required result. In this stage, the following activities can be performed in a systematic manner. Some of the important activities are:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-processing-classification">i) Classification</h4>
                        <p>The data is classified into different groups and subgroups, so that each group or sub-group of data can be handled separately.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-processing-calculations">ii) Calculations</h4>
                        <p>The arithmetic operations are performed on the numeric data to get the required results. For example, total marks of each student are calculated.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-processing-summarising">iii) Summarising</h4>
                        <p>The data is processed to represent it in a summarized form. Summary of data is often prepared for top management. For example, the summary of the data of students is prepared to show the percentage of pass and fail student examination etc.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-processing-storing">iv) Storing</h4>
                        <p>The data is arranged into an order so that it can be accessed very quickly as and when required.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="dpc-data-output">4. DATA OUTPUT</h3>
                        <p>Mostly, the output is stored on the storage media for later user. In output step, the following activities can be performed.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-output-retrieval">i) Retrieval</h4>
                        <p>Output stored on the storage media can be retrieved at any time and for different purposes.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-output-conversion">ii) Conversion</h4>
                        <p>The generated output can be converted into different forms. For example, it can be represented into graphical form.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dpc-output-communication">iii) Communication</h4>
                        <p>The generated output is sent to different places. For example, weather forecast is prepared and sent to different agencies and newspapers etc. where it is required.</p>

Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as word processors or spreadsheet applications.

If the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of social interfaces.</span></li>

Batch jobs are set up so they can be run to completion without human interaction i.e. programs and data are collected together in a batch before processing starts. This is in contrast to "online" or interactive programs which prompt the user for such input. Spooling batch systems use the concept of spooling which is an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations on line. Spooling refers to putting jobs in a buffer, a special area in memory or on a disk where a device can access them when it is ready. Spooling is useful because device access data that different rates. The buffer provides a waiting station where data can rest while the slower device catches up. The most common spooling application is print spooling. In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer and then the printer pulls them off the buffer at its own rate.</span></li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are a large number of ways records can be organised on disk or tape. The main methods of file organisation used for files are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Serial</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="file-organization-serial">a) Serial Organization/Access Method</h3>
                        <p>Serial files are stored in chronological order, which is as each record is received it is stored in the next available storage position. In general it is only used on a serial medium such as Magnetic tape. This type of file organization means that the records are in no particular order and therefore to retrieve a single record the whole file needs to be read from the beginning to end. Serial organization is usually the method used for creating Transaction files (unsorted), Work and Dump files.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="file-organization-sequential">b) Sequential Organization</h3>
                        <p>Sequential files are serial files whose records are sorted and stored in an ascending or descending order on a particular key field. The physical order of the records on the disk is not necessarily sequential. They are no longer physically contiguous with the preceding and following logical records, but they can be retrieved in sequence.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Records are chained together by pointers to permit fast retrieval in search key order.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Pointer points to next record in order.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Records are stored physically in search key order (or as close to this as possible).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is difficult to maintain physical sequential order as records are inserted and deleted.</span></li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="file-organization-indexed-sequential">c) Indexed Sequential Organization(ISAM)</h3>
                        <p>Indexed Sequential file organization is logically the same as sequential organization, but an index is built indicating the block containing the record with a given value for the Key field.</p>
                        <p>This method combines the advantages of a sequential file with the possibility of direct access using the Primary Key (the primary Key is the field that is used to control the sequence of the records).</p>
                        <p>The index makes it possible to retrieve individual records quickly without having to search an entire data set.</p>
                        <p>The data in a dictionary is stored in sequential manner. However an index is provided in terms of thumb tabs. To search for a word we do not search sequentially. We access the index that is the appropriate thumb tab, locate an approximate location for the word and then proceed to find the word sequentially.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>To implement the concept of indexed sequential file organizations, we consider an approach in which the index part and data part reside on a separate file. The index file has a tree structure and data file has a sequential structure. Since the data file is sequenced, it is not necessary for the index to have an entry for each record Following figure shows a sequential file with a two-level index.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="file-organization-random">d) Random (or Direct)</h3>
                        <p>A randomly organized file contains records arranged physically without regard to the sequence of the primary key. Records are loaded to disk by establishing a direct relationship between the Key of the record and its address on the file, normally by use of a formula (or algorithm) that converts the primary Key to a physical disk address. This relationship is also used for retrieval. Disks are random access media, whereas tapes are sequential access media.</p>

                        <p>The use of a formula (or algorithm) is known as 'Key Transformation' and there are several techniques that can be used:</p>
                        <p>Division Taking Quotient<br>Division Taking Remainder<br>Truncation<br>Folding<br>Squaring<br>Radix Conversion</p>

                         </figure>
                        <p>These methods are often mixed to produce a unique address (or location) for each record (key).</p>
