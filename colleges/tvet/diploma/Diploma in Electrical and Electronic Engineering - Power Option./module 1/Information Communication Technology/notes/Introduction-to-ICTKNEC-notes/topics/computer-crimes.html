                        <p>A denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. A DoS attack generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.There are many ways to disrupt service, including such physical means as arson or explosions; shutting off power, air conditioning, or water (needed by air conditioning systems); or performing various kinds of electromagnetic disturbances.</p>

                        <p>Masquerading occurs when one person uses the identity of another to gain access to a computer. This may be done in person or remotely. There are both physical and electronic forms of masquerading. In person, a criminal may use an authorized user's identity or access card to get into restricted areas where he will have access to computers and data. This may be as simple as signing someone else's name to a sign-in sheet at the door of a building. It may be as complex as playing back a voice recording of someone else to gain entry via a voice recognition system.</p>
                        <p>A related attack, sometimes called piggybacking, involves following an authorized person into a restricted area--a building or a computer room.</p>
                        <p>People are very likely to pick passwords that can be easily guessed by intruders or can be cracked by password cracking or dictionary programs.

                        <p>Software piracy is the unauthorized reproduction and illegal distribution of software, whether for business or personal use. Employees need to be educated about the legalities, ethics, and company policies relating to software piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying of information. Some breaches really come down to policy and policy enforcement. What might be considered a crime in some organizations might be a minor infraction, or even legitimate, in another. For example, does an organization allow employees to carry sensitive data outside the office? Can the employee use company software and databases from a home computer?</p>

                        <p>is an obvious attack that falls into this category. Espionage agents steal national defense information. Industrial spies steal their competitors' product information. Crackers steal passwords or other kinds of information on breaking into systems.</p>
                        <p>Two terms you'll hear in the context of data attacks are inference and leakage. With inference, a user legitimately views a number of small pieces of data, but by putting those small pieces together is able to deduce some piece of non-obvious and secret data. With leakage, a user gains access to a flow of data via an unauthorized access route (e.g., through eavesdropping).</p>

                        <p>Preventing and detecting this type of attack requires coordinated policies among the different categories of computer security.

                        <p>A trap door is a quick way into a program that allows program developers to bypass all of the security built into the program now or in the future but can be exploited by criminals to gain unauthorized access to a system. To a programmer, trap doors make sense. If a programmer needs to modify the program sometime in the future, he can use the trap door instead of having to go through all of the normal, customer-directed protocols just to make the change. Trap doors of course should be closed or eliminated in the final version of the program after all testing is complete, but, intentionally or unintentionally, some are left in place. Other trap doors may be introduced by error and only later discovered by crackers who are roaming around, looking for a way into system programs and files. Typical trap doors use such system features as debugging tools, program exits that transfer control to privileged areas of memory, undocumented application calls and parameters, and many others.</p>

                        <p>A Trojan horse is a method for inserting instructions in a program so that program performs an unauthorized function while apparently performing a useful one. Trojan horses are a common technique for planting other problems in computers, including viruses, worms, logic bombs, and salami attacks (more about these later). Trojan horses are a commonly used method for committing computer-based fraud and are very hard to detect.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="botnets">iii. Botnets</h3>
                        <p>A botnet (also known as a zombie army) is a number of Internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been set up to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the Internet. Any such computer is referred to as a zombie - in effect, a computer "robot" or "bot" that serves the wishes of some master spam or virus originator. Most computers compromised in this way are home-based.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="ransomware">v. Ransomware</h3>
                        <p>This is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="viruses-and-worms">v. Viruses and Worms</h3>
                        <p>In a computer, a virus is a program which modifies other programs so they replicate the virus. In other words, a virus affects the way a program operates. It inserts a copy of itself in the code. Thus, when the program runs, it makes a copy of the virus. This happens only on a single system. However, if a virus infects a program which is copied to a disk and transferred to another computer, it could also infect programs on that computer. This is how a computer virus spreads.</p>
                        <p>Unlike a virus, a worm is a standalone program in its own right. It exists independently of any other program. To run, it does not need other programs. A worm simply replicates itself on one computer and tries to infect other computers that may be attached to the same network.</p>
                        <p>A worm operates over a network, but in order to infect a machine, a virus must be physically copied.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="salamis">vi. Salamis</h3>
                        <p>This technique causes small amounts of assets especially money to be removed from a larger pool over a period of time. Usually, the amount stolen each time is so small that the victim of the salami fraud never even notices.</p>
                        <p>A clever thief can use a Trojan horse to hide a salami program that puts all of the rounded off values into his account. A tiny percentage of pennies may not sound like much until you add up thousands of accounts, month after month.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="logic-bombs">vii. Logic Bombs</h3>
                        <p>A typical logic bomb tells the computer to execute a set of instructions at a certain date and time or under certain specified conditions. The instructions may tell the computer to display a message on the screen, or it may tell the entire system to start erasing itself. Logic bombs may also find their way into computer systems by way of Trojan horses. Logic bombs often work in tandem with viruses. Whereas a simple virus infects a program and then replicates when the program starts to run, the logic bomb does not replicate - it merely waits for some pre-specified event or time to do its damage.</p>
                        <p>Some bombs do their damage after a particular program is run a certain number of times. Trojan horses present a major threat to computer systems, not just because of the damage they themselves can do, but because they provide a technique to facilitate more devastating crimes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="data-diddling">viii. Data Diddling</h3>
                        <p>Data diddling, sometimes called false data entry, involves modifying data before or after it is entered into the computer Consider situations in which employees are able to falsify time cards before the data contained on the cards is entered into the computer for payroll computation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="ip-spoofing">ix. IP Spoofing</h3>
                        <p>A method of masquerading in which an attacker forges the IP addresses on the data packets he sends so they look as if they came from inside a network on which systems trust each other. Because the attacker's system looks like an inside system, he is never asked for a password or any other type of authentication.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="password-sniffing">x. Password Sniffing</h3>
                        <p>Password sniffers are programs that simply collect the first 128 or more bytes of each network connection on the network that they want to attack. When a user types in a user name and a password--as required when using certain common Internet services like FTP (which is used to transfer files from one machine to another) or Telnet (which lets the user log in remotely to another machine)--the sniffer collects that information. Additional programs sift through the collected information, pull out the important pieces (e.g., the user names and passwords), and cover up the existence of the sniffers in an automated way. Best estimates are that in 1994 as many as 100,000 sites were affected by sniffer attacks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="rootkits">xi. Rootkits</h3>
                        <p>A rootkit is a type of malicious software that is activated each time your system boots up. Rootkits are difficult to detect because they are activated before the Operating System has completely booted up. A rootkit often allows the installation of hidden files, processes, hidden user accounts, and more in the systems OS. They are also able to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="keyloggers">xii. Keyloggers</h3>
                        <p>This is a type of malware that records (or logs) the keys struck on a keyboard, usually in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and then the information is transmitted to the originators.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="excess-privileges">xiii. Excess Privileges</h3>
                        <p>This is a situation where users in a system have excess privileges--more privileges than they ought to have. If a cracker breaks into one user's account, he can compromise and damage that user's files, but he can't ordinarily get beyond the boundaries of the user's account to damage the rest of the system.</p>
                        <p>An ordinary user on an ordinary system doesn't need to be able to modify all of the files on that system. And yet, in many systems, a user has the system privileges that entitle him to do just that. The user may never actually want to change anyone else's files--he may not even know that he is allowed to--but nevertheless the privileges are there. If an intruder gets access to the system through the user's account, he can exploit this weakness.</p>

                        <p>Two terms you'll hear in the context of data attacks are inference and leakage. With inference, a user legitimately views a number of small pieces of data, but by putting those small pieces together is able to deduce some piece of non-obvious and secret data. With leakage, a user gains access to a flow of data via an unauthorized access route (e.g., through eavesdropping).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="unauthorized-copying-of-data">ii. Unauthorized Copying of Data</h3>
                        <p>Preventing and detecting this type of attack requires coordinated policies among the different categories of computer security. In terms of personnel security, user education is vital. In terms of operations security, automated logging and auditing software can play a part as well.</p>
