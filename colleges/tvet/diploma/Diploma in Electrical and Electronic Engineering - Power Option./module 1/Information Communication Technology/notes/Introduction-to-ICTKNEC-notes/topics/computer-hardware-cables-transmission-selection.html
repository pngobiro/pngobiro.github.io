                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most of you probably know, that connecting of peripheral devices or hardware component to a computer requires a specific type of cable. However, this can be quite confusing because of the wide variety of cables that exists, so in this post I will try to provide you with a short description of some of the most frequently used cables.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="cable-vga">1. VGA</h3>
                        <p>vga cableAnalog VGA interface was created in the late 1980's and until now remains a standard way for connection between a computer and monitor. Today, however, it is almost replaced by the digital interface DVI. VGA consists of 15 contacts arranged in three rows, each of which corresponds to three separate channels - red, green and blue. Although almost all video cards on the market are equipped with DVI, you will encounter many displays, allowing the connection to VGA, through VGA to DVI adapter.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="cable-pata">2. Parallel ATA (IDE)</h3>
                        <p>ide-cableParallel ATA (PATA) cables are used for the connection of storage devices such as hard disks, solid-state drives, and CD-ROM drives to the computer's motherboard. The Paralel ATA cable is a ribbon cable with two or three connectors, one of which plugs into the ATA connector mounted on the motherboard and the remaining connector(s) plug into drives. Each connector has 40 pins ( 44 pins for the smaller formfactor version used for 2.5" drives). Note that if two drives are attached to a single cable, one must be configured as master and the other as slave.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="cable-sata">3. SATA</h3>
                        <p>sata cableThe serial ATA (serial advanced technology attachment), or SATA cables are designed to replace the older ATA cables used for connection of storage devices. Since SATA offers higher data transfer speeds, almost all modern desktop motherboards have integrated SATA host adapters. Unlike PATA, the same SATA connectors are used on both 3.5 -inch SATA drives (used in desktop and server computers) and 2.5inch drives (for portable computers). Each SATA cable has two 8-pin connectors (one on each end) and connects one motherboard socket to one hard drive.</p>

In addition to standard USB connector, there are also smaller ones, such as Mini-USB and Micro-USB, which are used in mobile devices. There are different types of cables, that combine different types of USB connectors.</p>

The e-SATA port is very similar to the SATA ports inside the computer.

                        <p>Importandvi cablet : To decide which type of DVI cable to use you have to heck both of the female DVI plugs on your devices to determine what signals they are compatible with. Note that the long flat pin on a DVI-I connector is wider than the same pin on a DVI-D connector. That's why it is not possible to connect a male DVI-I to a female DVI-D by but it's possible to connect a male DVI-D cable to a female DVI-I connector. If both connections are DVI-I a DVI-I cable is recommended. There are also special DVI to VGA cables or a DVI/VGA adapters. In case if one connection is analog and the other connection is digital you will need a special VGA to DVI or DVI to VGA converter.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Serial and Parallel Transmission</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Digital data transmission can occur in two basic modes: serial or parallel. Data within a computer system is transmitted via parallel mode on buses with the width of the parallel bus matched to the word size of the computer system. Data between computer systems is usually transmitted in bit serial mode . Consequently, it is necessary to make a parallel-to-serial conversion at a computer interface when sending data from a computer system into a network and a serial-to-parallel conversion at a computer interface when receiving information from a network. The type of transmission mode used may also depend upon distance and required data rate.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="parallel-transmission">Parallel Transmission</h3>
                        <p>In parallel transmission, multiple bits (usually 8 bits or a byte/character) are sent simultaneously on different channels (wires, frequency channels) within the same cable, or radio path, and synchronized to a clock. Parallel devices have a wider data bus than serial devices and can therefore transfer data in words of one or more bytes at a time. As a result, there is a speedup in parallel transmission bit rate over serial transmission bit rate. However, this speedup is a tradeoff versus cost since multiple wires cost more than a single wire, and as a parallel cable gets longer, the synchronization timing between multiple channels becomes more sensitive to distance. The timing for parallel transmission is provided by a constant clocking signal sent over a separate wire within the parallel cable; thus parallel transmission is considered synchronous .</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="serial-transmission">Serial Transmission</h3>
                        <p>In serial transmission, bits are sent sequentially on the same channel (wire) which reduces costs for wire but also slows the speed of transmission. Also, for serial transmission, some overhead time is needed since bits must be assembled and sent as a unit and then disassembled at the receiver.</p>
