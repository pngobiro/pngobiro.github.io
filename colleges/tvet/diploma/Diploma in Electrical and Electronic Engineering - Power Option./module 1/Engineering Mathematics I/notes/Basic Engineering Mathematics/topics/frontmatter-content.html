                        <p>Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition introduces and then consolidates basic mathematical principles and promotes awareness of mathematical concepts for students needing a broad base for further vocational studies.<br>
                        In this fifth edition, new material has been added to many of the chapters, particularly some of the earlier chapters, together with extra practical problems interspersed throughout the text. The extent of this fifth edition is such that four chapters from the previous edition have been removed and placed on the easily available website http://www.booksite.elsevier.com/newnes/bird. The chapters removed to the website are 'Number sequences', 'Binary, octal and hexadecimal', 'Inequalities' and 'Graphs with logarithmic scales'.<br>
                        The text is relevant to:<br>
                        - 'Mathematics for Engineering Technicians' for BTEC First NQF Level 2 - Chapters 1-12, 16-18, 20, 21, 23 and 25-27 are needed for this module.<br>
                        - The mandatory 'Mathematics for Technicians' for BTEC National Certificate and National Diploma in Engineering, NQF Level 3 - Chapters 7-10, 14-17, 19, 20-23, 25-27, 31, 32, 34 and 35 are needed and, in addition, Chapters 1-6, 11 and 12 are helpful revision for this module.<br>
                        - Basic mathematics for a wide range of introductory/access/foundation mathematics courses.<br>
                        - GCSE revision and for similar mathematics courses in English-speaking countries worldwide.<br>
                        Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition provides a lead into Engineering Mathematics 6th Edition.<br>
                        Each topic considered in the text is presented in a way that assumes in the reader little previous knowledge of that topic. Each chapter begins with a brief outline of essential theory, definitions, formulae, laws and procedures; however, these are kept to a minimum<br>
                        as problem solving is extensively used to establish and exemplify the theory. It is intended that readers will gain real understanding through seeing problems solved and then solving similar problems themselves.<br>
                        This textbook contains some <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{750}$</span> worked problems, followed by over <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{1550}$</span> further problems (all with answers at the end of the book) contained within some<br>
                        <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{161}$</span> Practice Exercises; each Practice Exercise follows on directly from the relevant section of work. In addition, <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{376}$</span> line diagrams enhance understanding of the theory. Where at all possible, the problems mirror potential practical situations found in engineering and science.<br>
                        Placed at regular intervals throughout the text are <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{14}$</span> Revision Tests (plus another for the website chapters) to check understanding. For example, Revision Test 1 covers material contained in Chapters 1 and 2, Revision Test 2 covers the material contained in Chapters 3-5, and so on. These Revision Tests do not have answers given since it is envisaged that lecturers/instructors could set the tests for students to attempt as part of their course structure. Lecturers/instructors may obtain a complimentary set of solutions of the Revision Tests in an Instructor's Manual, available from the publishers via the internet - see http://www.booksite.elsevier.com/newnes/bird.<br>
                        At the end of the book a list of relevant formulae contained within the text is included for convenience of reference.<br>
                        The principle of learning by example is at the heart of Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition.</p>
