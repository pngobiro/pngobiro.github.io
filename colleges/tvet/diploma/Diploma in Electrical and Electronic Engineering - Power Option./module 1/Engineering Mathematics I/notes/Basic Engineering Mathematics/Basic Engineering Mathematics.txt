\section*{Preface}

Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition introduces and then consolidates basic mathematical principles and promotes awareness of mathematical concepts for students needing a broad base for further vocational studies.
In this fifth edition, new material has been added to many of the chapters, particularly some of the earlier chapters, together with extra practical problems interspersed throughout the text. The extent of this fifth edition is such that four chapters from the previous edition have been removed and placed on the easily available website http://www.booksite.elsevier.com/newnes/bird. The chapters removed to the website are 'Number sequences', 'Binary, octal and hexadecimal', 'Inequalities' and 'Graphs with logarithmic scales'.
The text is relevant to:
- 'Mathematics for Engineering Technicians' for BTEC First NQF Level 2 - Chapters 1-12, 16-18, 20, 21, 23 and 25-27 are needed for this module.
- The mandatory 'Mathematics for Technicians' for BTEC National Certificate and National Diploma in Engineering, NQF Level 3 - Chapters 7-10, 14-17, $19,20-23,25-27,31,32,34$ and 35 are needed and, in addition, Chapters 1-6, 11 and 12 are helpful revision for this module.
- Basic mathematics for a wide range of introductory/access/foundation mathematics courses.
- GCSE revision and for similar mathematics courses in English-speaking countries worldwide.
Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition provides a lead into Engineering Mathematics 6th Edition.
Each topic considered in the text is presented in a way that assumes in the reader little previous knowledge of that topic. Each chapter begins with a brief outline of essential theory, definitions, formulae, laws and procedures; however, these are kept to a minimum
as problem solving is extensively used to establish and exemplify the theory. It is intended that readers will gain real understanding through seeing problems solved and then solving similar problems themselves.
This textbook contains some $\mathbf{7 5 0}$ worked problems, followed by over 1550 further problems (all with answers at the end of the book) contained within some
161 Practice Exercises; each Practice Exercise follows on directly from the relevant section of work. In addition, $\mathbf{3 7 6}$ line diagrams enhance understanding of the theory. Where at all possible, the problems mirror potential practical situations found in engineering and science.
Placed at regular intervals throughout the text are 14 Revision Tests (plus another for the website chapters) to check understanding. For example, Revision Test 1 covers material contained in Chapters 1 and 2, Revision Test 2 covers the material contained in Chapters 3-5, and so on. These Revision Tests do not have answers given since it is envisaged that lecturers/instructors could set the tests for students to attempt as part of their course structure. Lecturers/instructors may obtain a complimentary set of solutions of the Revision Tests in an Instructor's Manual, available from the publishers via the internet - see http://www.booksite.elsevier.com/newnes/bird.
At the end of the book a list of relevant formulae contained within the text is included for convenience of reference.
The principle of learning by example is at the heart of Basic Engineering Mathematics 5th Edition.

\section*{Chapter 1}

\section*{Basic arithmetic}

\subsection*{1.1 Introduction}

Whole numbers are called integers. $+3,+5$ and +72 are examples of positive integers; $-13,-6$ and -51 are examples of negative integers. Between positive and negative integers is the number 0 which is neither positive nor negative.
The four basic arithmetic operators are add ( + ), subtract $(-)$, multiply $(\times)$ and divide $(\div)$.
It is assumed that adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing reasonably small numbers can be achieved without a calculator. However, if revision of this area is needed then some worked problems are included in the following sections.
When unlike signs occur together in a calculation, the overall sign is negative. For example,
$$3+(-4)=3+-4=3-4=\mathbf{- 1}$$
and
$$(+5) \times(-2)=\mathbf{- 1 0}$$

Like signs together give an overall positive sign. For example,
$$3-(-4)=3--4=3+4=7$$
and
$$(-6) \times(-4)=+24$$

\subsection*{1.2 Revision of addition and subtraction}

You can probably already add two or more numbers together and subtract one number from another. However, if you need a revision then the following worked problems should be helpful.

Problem 1. Determine $735+167$
$$\begin{array}{r}
\text { HTU } \\
735 \\
+167 \\
\hline 902 \\
\hline 11
\end{array}$$
(i) $5+7=12$. Place 2 in units (U) column. Carry 1 in the tens (T) column.
(ii) $3+6+1($ carried $)=10$. Place the 0 in the tens column. Carry the 1 in the hundreds $(\mathrm{H})$ column.
(iii) $7+1+1$ (carried) $=9$. Place the 9 in the hundreds column.

Hence, $\mathbf{7 3 5}+\mathbf{1 6 7}=\mathbf{9 0 2}$

Problem 2. Determine 632-369

\section*{H T U \\ 632 \\ -369 \\ 263}
(i) $2-9$ is not possible; therefore 'borrow' 1 from the tens column (leaving 2 in the tens column). In the units column, this gives us $12-9=3$.
(ii) Place 3 in the units column.
(iii) $2-6$ is not possible; therefore 'borrow' 1 from the hundreds column (leaving 5 in the hundreds column). In the tens column, this gives us $12-6=6$.
(iv) Place the 6 in the tens column.

\section*{2 Basic Engineering Mathematics}
(v) $5-3=2$.
(vi) Place the 2 in the hundreds column.

Hence, $\mathbf{6 3 2 - 3 6 9 = 2 6 3}$
Problem 3. Add 27, $-74,81$ and -19

This problem is written as $27-74+81-19$.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Adding the positive integers:} & 27 \\
\hline & 81 \\
\hline Sum of positive integers is & 108 \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Adding the negative integers:} & 74 \\
\hline & 19 \\
\hline Sum of negative integers is & 93 \\
\hline \multirow[t]{3}{*}{Taking the sum of the negative integers from the sum of the positive integers gives} & 108 \\
\hline & -93 \\
\hline & 15 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus, $27-74+81-19=15$

\section*{Problem 4. Subtract -74 from 377}

This problem is written as $377--74$. Like signs together give an overall positive sign, hence
$$\begin{array}{r}
377--74=377+74 \begin{array}{r}
377 \\
+\quad 74 \\
\hline 451 \\
\hline
\end{array} \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Thus, $\mathbf{3 7 7} \mathbf{- \mathbf { - 7 4 } = \mathbf { 4 5 1 }}$

\section*{Problem 5. Subtract 243 from 126}

The problem is $126-243$. When the second number is larger than the first, take the smaller number from the larger and make the result negative. Thus,
$$\begin{array}{r}
126-243=-(243-126) \quad \begin{array}{r}
243 \\
-126 \\
\hline 117 \\
\hline
\end{array} \mathbf{r} \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Thus, $\mathbf{1 2 6} \mathbf{- 2 4 3}=\mathbf{- 1 1 7}$

Problem 6. Subtract 318 from -269

The problem is $-269-318$. The sum of the negative integers is
$$\begin{array}{r}
269 \\
+318 \\
\hline 587 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Thus, $\mathbf{- 2 6 9 - 3 1 8}=\mathbf{- 5 8 7}$

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

Practice Exercise 1 Further problems on addition and subtraction (answers on page 340)

In Problems 1 to 15 , determine the values of the expressions given, without using a calculator.
1. $67 \mathrm{~kg}-82 \mathrm{~kg}+34 \mathrm{~kg}$
2. $73 \mathrm{~m}-57 \mathrm{~m}$
3. $851 \mathrm{~mm}-372 \mathrm{~mm}$
4. $124-273+481-398$
5. $Â£ 927-Â£ 114+Â£ 182-Â£ 183-Â£ 247$
6. $647-872$
7. $2417-487+2424-1778-4712$
8. $-38419-2177+2440-799+2834$
9. Â£2715-Â£18250 +Â£11471-Â£1509 + Â£113274
10. $47+(-74)-(-23)$
11. $813-(-674)$
12. $3151-(-2763)$
13. $4872 \mathrm{~g}-4683 \mathrm{~g}$
14. $-23148-47724$
15. $\$ 53774-\$ 38441$

Figure 1.1

\subsection*{1.3 Revision of multiplication and division}

You can probably already multiply two numbers together and divide one number by another. However, if you need a revision then the following worked problems should be helpful.

Problem 7. Determine $86 \times 7$
$$\begin{array}{r}
\text { HTU } \\
86 \\
\times \quad 7 \\
\hline 602 \\
\hline 4
\end{array}$$
(i) $7 \times 6=42$. Place the 2 in the units (U) column and 'carry' the 4 into the tens $(\mathrm{T})$ column.
(ii) $7 \times 8=56$; $56+4($ carried $)=60$. Place the 0 in the tens column and the 6 in the hundreds ( H ) column.

Hence, $86 \times 7=602$
A good grasp of multiplication tables is needed when multiplying such numbers; a reminder of the multiplication table up to $12 \times 12$ is shown below. Confidence with handling numbers will be greatly improved if this table is memorized.

\section*{Problem 8. Determine $764 \times 38$}
$$\begin{array}{r}
764 \\
\times \quad 38 \\
\hline 6112 \\
22920 \\
\hline 29032 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

(i) $8 \times 4=32$. Place the 2 in the units column and carry 3 into the tens column.
(ii) $8 \times 6=48 ; 48+3$ (carried) $=51$. Place the 1 in the tens column and carry the 5 into the hundreds column.
(iii) $8 \times 7=56$; $56+5($ carried $)=61$. Place 1 in the hundreds column and 6 in the thousands column.

Hence, $\mathbf{7 6 4} \times \mathbf{3 8} \mathbf{=} \mathbf{2 9 0 3 2}$
Again, knowing multiplication tables is rather important when multiplying such numbers.
It is appreciated, of course, that such a multiplication can, and probably will, be performed using a calculator. However, there are times when a calculator may not be available and it is then useful to be able to calculate the 'long way'.

\section*{Problem 9. Multiply 178 by -46}

When the numbers have different signs, the result will be negative. (With this in mind, the problem can now be solved by multiplying 178 by 46). Following the procedure of Problem 8 gives
$$\begin{array}{r}
178 \\
\times \quad 46 \\
\hline 1068 \\
7120 \\
\hline 8188 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Thus, $178 \times 46=8188$ and $\mathbf{1 7 8} \times(\mathbf{4 6})=\mathbf{- 8 1 8 8}$

\section*{Problem 10. Determine $1834 \div 7$}
$$\begin{array}{r}

(i) 7 into 18 goes 2 , remainder 4 . Place the 2 above the 8 of 1834 and carry the 4 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 43.
(ii) 7 into 43 goes 6 , remainder 1. Place the 6 above the 3 of 1834 and carry the 1 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 14 .
(iii) 7 into 14 goes 2, remainder 0 . Place 2 above the 4 of 1834.
Hence, $1834 \div 7=1834 / 7=\frac{\mathbf{1 8 3 4}}{\mathbf{7}}=262$.
The method shown is called short division.

Problem 11. Determine $5796 \div 12$
$$\begin{gathered}

\end{gathered}$$
(i) 12 into 5 won't go. 12 into 57 goes 4 ; place 4 above the 7 of 5796 .
(ii) $4 \times 12=48$; place the 48 below the 57 of 5796 .
(iii) $57-48=9$.
(iv) Bring down the 9 of 5796 to give 99 .
(v) 12 into 99 goes 8 ; place 8 above the 9 of 5796 .
(vi) $8 \times 12=96$; place 96 below the 99 .
(vii) $99-96=3$.
(viii) Bring down the 6 of 5796 to give 36 .
(ix) 12 into 36 goes 3 exactly.
(x) Place the 3 above the final 6 .
(xi) Place the 36 below the 36 .
(xii) $36-36=0$.

Hence, $5796 \div 12=5796 / 12=\frac{\mathbf{5 7 9 6}}{\mathbf{1 2}}=483$.
The method shown is called long division.

\subsection*{1.4 Highest common factors and lowest common multiples}

When two or more numbers are multiplied together, the individual numbers are called factors. Thus, a factor is a number which divides into another number exactly. The highest common factor (HCF) is the largest number which divides into two or more numbers exactly.
For example, consider the numbers 12 and 15.
The factors of 12 are $1,2,3,4,6$ and 12 (i.e. all the numbers that divide into 12 ).
The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5 and 15 (i.e. all the numbers that divide into 15).
1 and 3 are the only common factors; i.e., numbers which are factors of both 12 and 15 .
Hence, the HCF of $\mathbf{1 2}$ and $\mathbf{1 5}$ is $\mathbf{3}$ since 3 is the highest number which divides into both 12 and 15.
A multiple is a number which contains another number an exact number of times. The smallest number which
is exactly divisible by each of two or more numbers is called the lowest common multiple (LCM).
For example, the multiples of 12 are $12,24,36,48$, $60,72, \ldots$ and the multiples of 15 are $15,30,45$, 60, 75,...
60 is a common multiple (i.e. a multiple of both 12 and 15) and there are no lower common multiples.

Hence, the LCM of $\mathbf{1 2}$ and $\mathbf{1 5}$ is $\mathbf{6 0}$ since 60 is the lowest number that both 12 and 15 divide into.
Here are some further problems involving the determination of HCFs and LCMs.

Problem 12. Determine the HCF of the numbers 12,30 and 42

Probably the simplest way of determining an HCF is to express each number in terms of its lowest factors. This is achieved by repeatedly dividing by the prime numbers $2,3,5,7,11,13, \ldots$ (where possible) in turn. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 12=2 \times 2 \times 3 \\
& 30=2 \\
& 42=2 \times 3 \times 5 \\
& 4 \times 3
\end{aligned}$$

The factors which are common to each of the numbers are 2 in column 1 and 3 in column 3 , shown by the broken lines. Hence, the HCF is $\mathbf{2} \times \mathbf{3}$; i.e., $\mathbf{6}$. That is, 6 is the largest number which will divide into 12,30 and 42 .

Problem 13. Determine the HCF of the numbers 30, 105, 210 and 1155

Using the method shown in Problem 12:
$$\begin{aligned}
30 & =2 \times 3 \times 5 \\
105 & = \\
210 & =2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \\
1155 & =3 \times 7 \times 7 \times 11
\end{aligned}$$

The factors which are common to each of the numbers are 3 in column 2 and 5 in column 3. Hence, the HCF is $3 \times 5=15$.

Problem 14. Determine the LCM of the numbers 12,42 and 90

The LCM is obtained by finding the lowest factors of each of the numbers, as shown in Problems 12 and 13 above, and then selecting the largest group of any of the factors present. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 12=2 \times 2 \times 3 \\
& 42=2 \times 3 \\
& 90=2 \quad \times 3 \times 3 \times 5
\end{aligned}$$

The largest group of any of the factors present is shown by the broken lines and are $2 \times 2$ in $12,3 \times 3$ in 90,5 in 90 and 7 in 42.
Hence, the LCM is $\mathbf{2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 1 2 6 0}$ and is the smallest number which 12,42 and 90 will all divide into exactly.

Problem 15. Determine the LCM of the numbers 150, 210, 735 and 1365

Using the method shown in Problem 14 above:
$$\begin{aligned}
150 & =2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \\
210 & =2 \times 3 \times 5 \\
735= & 3 \times 5 \\
1365 & =3 \times 7 \times 7
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the LCM is $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 7 \times 7 \times 13=$ 95550.

\subsection*{1.5 Order of precedence and brackets}

\subsection*{1.5.1 Order of precedence}

Sometimes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers and brackets may all be involved in a calculation. For example,
$$5-3 \times 4+24 \div(3+5)-3^{2}$$

This is an extreme example but will demonstrate the order that is necessary when evaluating.
When we read, we read from left to right. However, with mathematics there is a definite order of precedence which we need to adhere to. The order is as follows:

Brackets
Order (or pOwer)
Division
Multiplication
Addition
Subtraction
Notice that the first letters of each word spell BODMAS, a handy aide-mÃ©moire. Order means pOwer. For example, $4^{2}=4 \times 4=16$.
$5-3 \times 4+24 \div(3+5)-3^{2}$ is evaluated as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
& 5-3 \times 4+24 \div(3+5)-3^{2} \\
& =5-3 \times 4+24 \div 8-3^{2} \quad \text { (Bracket is removed and } \\
& 3+5 \text { replaced with } 8 \text { ) } \\
& =5-3 \times 4+24 \div 8-9 \quad \text { (Order means pOwer; in } \\
& \text { this case, } 3^{2}=3 \times 3=9 \text { ) } \\
& =5-3 \times 4+3-9 \quad(\text { Division: } 24 \div 8=3) \\
& =5-12+3-9 \quad \text { (Multiplication: }-3 \times 4=-12 \text { ) } \\
& =8-12-9 \quad(\text { Addition: } 5+3=8) \\
& =-13 \quad(\text { Subtraction: } 8-12-9=-13)
\end{aligned}$$

In practice, it does not matter if multiplication is performed before division or if subtraction is performed before addition. What is important is that the process of multiplication and division must be completed before addition and subtraction.

\subsection*{1.5.2 Brackets and operators}

The basic laws governing the use of brackets and operators are shown by the following examples.
(a) $2+3=3+2$; i.e., the order of numbers when adding does not matter.
(b) $2 \times 3=3 \times 2$; i.e., the order of numbers when multiplying does not matter.
(c) $2+(3+4)=(2+3)+4$; i.e., the use of brackets when adding does not affect the result.
(d) $2 \times(3 \times 4)=(2 \times 3) \times 4$; i.e., the use of brackets when multiplying does not affect the result.
(e) $2 \times(3+4)=2(3+4)=2 \times 3+2 \times 4$; i.e., a number placed outside of a bracket indicates that the whole contents of the bracket must be multiplied by that number.
(f) $(2+3)(4+5)=(5)(9)=5 \times 9=45$; i.e., adjacent brackets indicate multiplication.
(g) $2[3+(4 \times 5)]=2[3+20]=2 \times 23=46 ; \quad$ i.e., when an expression contains inner and outer brackets, the inner brackets are removed first.

Here are some further problems in which BODMAS needs to be used.

\section*{Problem 16. Find the value of $6+4 \div(5-3)$}

The order of precedence of operations is remembered by the word BODMAS. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
6+4 \div(5-3) & =6+4 \div 2 & & (\text { Brackets }) \\
& =6+2 & & (\text { Division }) \\
& =\mathbf{8} & & (\text { Addition })
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 17. Determine the value of $13-2 \times 3+14 \div(2+5)$
$$\begin{aligned}
13-2 \times 3+14 \div(2+5) & =13-2 \times 3+14 \div 7 \\
& =13-2 \times 3+2 \\
& =13-6+2 \\
& =15-6 \\
& =9
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 18. Evaluate} $16 \div(2+6)+18[3+(4 \times 6)-21]$
$$\begin{aligned}
16 & \div(2+6)+18[3+(4 \times 6)-21] \\
& =16 \div(2+6)+18[3+24-21] \quad \text { (B: inner bracket } \\
& =16 \div 8+18 \times 6 \\
& =2+18 \times 6 \\
& =2+108 \\
& =\mathbf{1 1 0}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that a number outside of a bracket multiplies all that is inside the brackets. In this case,
$18[3+24-21]=18[6]$, which means $18 \times 6=108$

Problem 19. Find the value of
$23-4(2 \times 7)+\frac{(144 \div 4)}{(14-8)}$
$$\begin{aligned}
23-4(2 \times 7)+\frac{(144 \div 4)}{(14-8)} & =23-4 \times 14+\frac{36}{6} \\
& =23-4 \times 14+6 \\
& =23-56+6 \\
& =29-56 \\
& =-27
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 20. Evaluate}
$\frac{3+\sqrt{\left(5^{2}-3^{2}\right)}+2^{3}}{1+(4 \times 6) \div(3 \times 4)}+\frac{15 \div 3+2 \times 7-1}{3 \times \sqrt{4}+8-3^{2}+1}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{3+\sqrt{\left(5^{2}-3^{2}\right)}+2^{3}}{1+(4 \times 6) \div(3 \times 4)}+\frac{15 \div 3+2 \times 7-1}{3 \times \sqrt{4}+8-3^{2}+1} \\
& \quad=\frac{3+4+8}{1+24 \div 12}+\frac{15 \div 3+2 \times 7-1}{3 \times 2+8-9+1} \\
& \quad=\frac{3+4+8}{1+2}+\frac{5+2 \times 7-1}{3 \times 2+8-9+1} \\
& \quad=\frac{15}{3}+\frac{5+14-1}{6+8-9+1} \\
& \quad=5+\frac{18}{6} \\
& \quad=5+3=\mathbf{8}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Fractions}

\subsection*{2.1 Introduction}

A mark of 9 out of 14 in an examination may be written as $\frac{9}{14}$ or $9 / 14 . \frac{9}{14}$ is an example of a fraction. The number above the line, i.e. 9 , is called the numerator. The number below the line, i.e. 14 , is called the denominator.
When the value of the numerator is less than the value of the denominator, the fraction is called a proper fraction. $\frac{9}{14}$ is an example of a proper fraction.
When the value of the numerator is greater than the value of the denominator, the fraction is called an improper fraction. $\frac{5}{2}$ is an example of an improper fraction.
A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a fraction. $2 \frac{1}{2}$ is an example of a mixed number. In fact, $\frac{5}{2}=2 \frac{1}{2}$.
There are a number of everyday examples in which fractions are readily referred to. For example, three people equally sharing a bar of chocolate would have $\frac{1}{3}$ each. A supermarket advertises $\frac{1}{5}$ off a six-pack of beer; if the beer normally costs $Â£ 2$ then it will now cost $Â£ 1.60$. $\frac{3}{4}$ of the employees of a company are women; if the company has 48 employees, then 36 are women.
Calculators are able to handle calculations with fractions. However, to understand a little more about fractions we will in this chapter show how to add, subtract, multiply and divide with fractions without the use of a calculator.

Problem 1. Change the following improper fractions into mixed numbers:
(a) $\frac{9}{2}$
(b) $\frac{13}{4}$
(c) $\frac{28}{5}$
(a) $\frac{9}{2}$ means 9 halves and $\frac{9}{2}=9 \div 2$, and $9 \div 2=4$ and 1 half, i.e.
$$\frac{9}{2}=4 \frac{1}{2}$$
(b) $\frac{13}{4}$ means 13 quarters and $\frac{13}{4}=13 \div 4$, and $13 \div 4=3$ and 1 quarter, i.e.
$$\frac{13}{4}=3 \frac{1}{4}$$
(c) $\frac{28}{5}$ means 28 fifths and $\frac{28}{5}=28 \div 5$, and $28 \div 5=$ 5 and 3 fifths, i.e.
$$\frac{28}{5}=\mathbf{5} \frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{5}}$$

Problem 2. Change the following mixed numbers into improper fractions:
(a) $5 \frac{3}{4}$
(b) $1 \frac{7}{9}$
(c) $2 \frac{3}{7}$
(a) $5 \frac{3}{4}$ means $5+\frac{3}{4} .5$ contains $5 \times 4=20$ quarters. Thus, $5 \frac{3}{4}$ contains $20+3=23$ quarters, i.e.
$$5 \frac{3}{4}=\frac{\mathbf{2 3}}{\mathbf{4}}$$

The quick way to change $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction is $\frac{4 \times 5+3}{4}=\frac{\mathbf{2 3}}{\mathbf{4}}$.
(b) $1 \frac{7}{9}=\frac{9 \times 1+7}{9}=\frac{\mathbf{1 6}}{\mathbf{9}}$.
(c) $2 \frac{3}{7}=\frac{7 \times 2+3}{7}=\frac{\mathbf{1 7}}{\mathbf{7}}$.

Problem 3. In a school there are 180 students of which 72 are girls. Express this as a fraction in its simplest form

The fraction of girls is $\frac{72}{180}$.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by the lowest prime number, i.e. 2 , gives
$$\frac{72}{180}=\frac{36}{90}$$

Dividing both the numerator and denominator again by 2 gives
$$\frac{72}{180}=\frac{36}{90}=\frac{18}{45}$$

2 will not divide into both 18 and 45 , so dividing both the numerator and denominator by the next prime number, i.e. 3, gives
$$\frac{72}{180}=\frac{36}{90}=\frac{18}{45}=\frac{6}{15}$$

Dividing both the numerator and denominator again by 3 gives
$$\frac{72}{180}=\frac{36}{90}=\frac{18}{45}=\frac{6}{15}=\frac{2}{5}$$

So $\frac{\mathbf{7 2}}{\mathbf{1 8 0}}=\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{5}}$ in its simplest form.
Thus, $\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{5}}$ of the students are girls.

\subsection*{2.2 Adding and subtracting fractions}

When the denominators of two (or more) fractions to be added are the same, the fractions can be added 'on sight'.

For example, $\quad \frac{2}{9}+\frac{5}{9}=\frac{7}{9}$ and $\frac{3}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{4}{8}$.
In the latter example, dividing both the 4 and the 8 by 4 gives $\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}$, which is the simplified answer. This is called cancelling.

Addition and subtraction of fractions is demonstrated in the following worked examples.

\section*{Problem 4. Simplify $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}$}
(i) Make the denominators the same for each fraction. The lowest number that both denominators divide into is called the lowest common multiple or LCM (see Chapter 1, page 5). In this example, the LCM of 3 and 2 is 6 .
(ii) 3 divides into 6 twice. Multiplying both numerator and denominator of $\frac{1}{3}$ by 2 gives
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-023.jpg?height=125&width=365&top_left_y=968&top_left_x=1355)
(iii) 2 divides into 6, 3 times. Multiplying both numerator and denominator of $\frac{1}{2}$ by 3 gives
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-023.jpg?height=123&width=362&top_left_y=1305&top_left_x=1354)
(iv) Hence,

Problem 5. Simplify $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{7}{16}$
(i) Make the denominators the same for each fraction. The lowest common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 16 is 16 .
(ii) 4 divides into 16, 4 times. Multiplying both numerator and denominator of $\frac{3}{4}$ by 4 gives
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-023.jpg?height=139&width=416&top_left_y=2203&top_left_x=1327)
(iii) $\frac{7}{16}$ already has a denominator of 16 .
(iv) Hence,

Problem 6. Simplify $4 \frac{2}{3}-1 \frac{1}{6}$
$4 \frac{2}{3}-1 \frac{1}{6}$ is the same as $\left(4 \frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(1 \frac{1}{6}\right)$ which is the same as $\left(4+\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(1+\frac{1}{6}\right)$ which is the same as $4+\frac{2}{3}-1-\frac{1}{6}$ which is the same as $3+\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{6}$ which is the same as $3+\frac{4}{6}-\frac{1}{6}=3+\frac{3}{6}=3+\frac{1}{2}$
Thus, $4 \frac{2}{3}-1 \frac{1}{6}=\mathbf{3} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}$
Problem 7. Evaluate $7 \frac{1}{8}-5 \frac{3}{7}$
$$\begin{aligned}
7 \frac{1}{8}-5 \frac{3}{7} & =\left(7+\frac{1}{8}\right)-\left(5+\frac{3}{7}\right)=7+\frac{1}{8}-5-\frac{3}{7} \\
& =2+\frac{1}{8}-\frac{3}{7}=2+\frac{7 \times 1-8 \times 3}{56} \\
& =2+\frac{7-24}{56}=2+\frac{-17}{56}=2-\frac{17}{56} \\
& =\frac{112}{56}-\frac{17}{56}=\frac{112-17}{56}=\frac{95}{56}=\mathbf{1} \frac{\mathbf{3 9}}{\mathbf{5 6}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 8. Determine the value of
$$4 \frac{5}{8}-3 \frac{1}{4}+1 \frac{2}{5}$$

\subsection*{2.3 Multiplication and division of fractions}

\subsection*{2.3.1 Multiplication}

To multiply two or more fractions together, the numerators are first multiplied to give a single number and this becomes the new numerator of the combined fraction. The denominators are then multiplied together to give the new denominator of the combined fraction.

For example, $\quad \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{7}=\frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 7}=\frac{\mathbf{8}}{\mathbf{2 1}}$

Problem 9. Simplify $7 \times \frac{2}{5}$
$$7 \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{7}{1} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{7 \times 2}{1 \times 5}=\frac{14}{5}=2 \frac{4}{5}$$

Problem 10. Find the value of $\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{14}{15}$
Dividing numerator and denominator by 3 gives
$$\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{14}{15}=\frac{1}{7} \times \frac{14}{5}=\frac{1 \times 14}{7 \times 5}$$

Dividing numerator and denominator by 7 gives
$$\frac{1 \times 14}{7 \times 5}=\frac{1 \times 2}{1 \times 5}=\frac{2}{5}$$

This process of dividing both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same factor(s) is called cancelling.

Problem 11. Simplify $\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{4}{9}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{4}{9} & =\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{4}{3} \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{4}{15}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 12. Evaluate $1 \frac{3}{5} \times 2 \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \frac{3}{7}$

Mixed numbers must be expressed as improper fractions before multiplication can be performed. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
1 \frac{3}{5} \times 2 \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \frac{3}{7} & =\left(\frac{5}{5}+\frac{3}{5}\right) \times\left(\frac{6}{3}+\frac{1}{3}\right) \times\left(\frac{21}{7}+\frac{3}{7}\right) \\
& =\frac{8}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} \times \frac{24}{7}=\frac{8 \times 1 \times 8}{5 \times 1 \times 1}=\frac{64}{5} \\
& =\mathbf{1 2} \frac{\mathbf{4}}{5}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 13. Simplify $3 \frac{1}{5} \times 1 \frac{2}{3} \times 2 \frac{3}{4}$
The mixed numbers need to be changed to improper fractions before multiplication can be performed.
$$\begin{aligned}
3 \frac{1}{5} \times 1 \frac{2}{3} \times 2 \frac{3}{4} & =\frac{16}{5} \times \frac{5}{3} \times \frac{11}{4} \\
& =\frac{4}{1} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{11}{1} \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{4 \times 1 \times 11}{1 \times 3 \times 1}=\frac{44}{3}=\mathbf{1 4} \frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{2.3.2 Division}

The simple rule for division is change the division sign into a multiplication sign and invert the second fraction.

For example, $\quad \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{3}{4}=\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{3}=\frac{\mathbf{8}}{\mathbf{9}}$
Problem 14. Simplify $\frac{3}{7} \div \frac{8}{21}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3}{7} \div \frac{8}{21}=\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{21}{8} & =\frac{3}{1} \times \frac{3}{8} \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{3 \times 3}{1 \times 8}=\frac{9}{8}=\mathbf{1} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{8}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. Find the value of $5 \frac{3}{5} \div 7 \frac{1}{3}$

The mixed numbers must be expressed as improper fractions. Thus,
$$5 \frac{3}{5} \div 7 \frac{1}{3}=\frac{28}{5} \div \frac{22}{3}=\frac{28}{5} \times \frac{3}{22}=\frac{14}{5} \times \frac{3}{11}=\frac{\mathbf{4 2}}{\mathbf{5 5}}$$

Problem 16. Simplify $3 \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \frac{3}{4} \div 2 \frac{3}{4}$

Mixed numbers must be expressed as improper fractions before multiplication and division can be performed:
$$\begin{aligned}
3 \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \frac{3}{4} \div 2 \frac{3}{4} & =\frac{11}{3} \times \frac{7}{4} \div \frac{11}{4}=\frac{11}{3} \times \frac{7}{4} \times \frac{4}{11} \\
& =\frac{1 \times 7 \times 1}{3 \times 1 \times 1} \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{7}{3}=\mathbf{2} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{2.4 Order of precedence with fractions}

As stated in Chapter 1, sometimes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers and brackets can all be involved in a calculation. A definite order of precedence must be adhered to. The order is:

\section*{Brackets}

Order (or pOwer)
Division

\section*{Multiplication}

\section*{Addition}

\section*{Subtraction}

This is demonstrated in the following worked problems.
Problem 17. Simplify $\frac{7}{20}-\frac{3}{8} \times \frac{4}{5}$

Problem 18. Simplify $\frac{1}{4}-2 \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{8}+\frac{9}{10}$
$$\begin{aligned}

& =\frac{1}{4}-\frac{11}{8}+\frac{9}{10} \\
& =\frac{1 \times 10}{4 \times 10}-\frac{11 \times 5}{8 \times 5}+\frac{9 \times 4}{10 \times 4}
\end{aligned}$$
(since the LCM of 4,8 and 10 is 40 )
$$\begin{aligned}

\section*{Chapter 3}

\subsection*{3.1 Introduction}

The decimal system of numbers is based on the digits 0 to 9.
There are a number of everyday occurrences in which we use decimal numbers. For example, a radio is, say, tuned to $107.5 \mathrm{MHz} \mathrm{FM} ; 107.5$ is an example of a decimal number.
In a shop, a pair of trainers cost, say, $Â£ 57.95 ; 57.95$ is another example of a decimal number. 57.95 is a decimal fraction, where a decimal point separates the integer, i.e. 57, from the fractional part, i.e. 0.95
57.95 actually means $(5 \times 10)+(7 \times 1)$
$$+\left(9 \times \frac{1}{10}\right)+\left(5 \times \frac{1}{100}\right)$$

\subsection*{3.2 Converting decimals to fractions and vice-versa}

Converting decimals to fractions and vice-versa is demonstrated below with worked examples.

Problem 1. Convert 0.375 to a proper fraction in its simplest form
(i) 0.375 may be written as $\frac{0.375 \times 1000}{1000}$ i.e. $0.375=\frac{375}{1000}$
(ii) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 gives $\frac{375}{1000}=\frac{75}{200}$

\section*{Decimals}
(iii) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 again gives $\frac{75}{200}=\frac{15}{40}$
(iv) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 again gives $\frac{15}{40}=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{8}}$
Since both 3 and 8 are only divisible by 1, we cannot 'cancel' any further, so $\frac{3}{8}$ is the 'simplest form' of the fraction.

Hence, the decimal fraction $0.375=\frac{3}{8}$ as a proper fraction.

Problem 2. Convert 3.4375 to a mixed number
(i) 0.4375 may be written as $\frac{0.4375 \times 10000}{10000}$ i.e. $0.4375=\frac{4375}{10000}$
(ii) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 gives $\frac{4375}{10000}=\frac{175}{400}$
(iii) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 gives $\frac{175}{400}=\frac{35}{80}$
(iv) Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 again gives $\frac{35}{80}=\frac{7}{16}$
Since both 5 and 16 are only divisible by 1 , we cannot 'cancel' any further, so $\frac{7}{16}$ is the 'lowest form' of the fraction.
(v) Hence, $0.4375=\frac{7}{16}$

Thus, the decimal fraction $3.4375=3 \frac{7}{16}$ as a mixed number.

Problem 3. Express $\frac{7}{8}$ as a decimal fraction
To convert a proper fraction to a decimal fraction, the numerator is divided by the denominator.
$$\begin{array}{r}
0.875 \\
8 \longdiv { 7 . 0 0 0 }
\end{array}$$
(i) 8 into 7 will not go. Place the 0 above the 7 .
(ii) Place the decimal point above the decimal point of 7.000
(iii) 8 into 70 goes 8 , remainder 6. Place the 8 above the first zero after the decimal point and carry the 6 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 60 .
(iv) 8 into 60 goes 7 , remainder 4. Place the 7 above the next zero and carry the 4 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 40.
(v) 8 into 40 goes 5 , remainder 0 . Place 5 above the next zero.
Hence, the proper fraction $\frac{7}{8}=0.875$ as a decimal fraction.

Problem 4. Express $5 \frac{13}{16}$ as a decimal fraction

For mixed numbers it is only necessary to convert the proper fraction part of the mixed number to a decimal fraction.
$$\begin{array}{r}
0.8125 \\
1 6 \longdiv { 1 3 . 0 0 0 0 }
\end{array}$$
(i) 16 into 13 will not go. Place the 0 above the 3 .
(ii) Place the decimal point above the decimal point of 13.0000
(iii) 16 into 130 goes 8 , remainder 2. Place the 8 above the first zero after the decimal point and carry the 2 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 20.
(iv) 16 into 20 goes 1, remainder 4. Place the 1 above the next zero and carry the 4 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 40 .
(v) 16 into 40 goes 2, remainder 8. Place the 2 above the next zero and carry the 8 remainder to the next digit on the right, making it 80 .
(vi) 16 into 80 goes 5, remainder 0. Place the 5 above the next zero.
(vii) Hence, $\frac{13}{16}=0.8125$

Thus, the mixed number $5 \frac{13}{16}=5.8125$ as a decimal fraction.

\subsection*{3.3 Significant figures and decimal places}

A number which can be expressed exactly as a decimal fraction is called a terminating decimal.

For example,
$$3 \frac{3}{16}=3.1825 \text { is a terminating decimal }$$

A number which cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal fraction is called a non-terminating decimal. For example,
$$1 \frac{5}{7}=1.7142857 \ldots \text { is a non-terminating decimal }$$

The answer to a non-terminating decimal may be expressed in two ways, depending on the accuracy required:
(a) correct to a number of significant figures, or
(b) correct to a number of decimal places i.e. the number of figures after the decimal point.

The last digit in the answer is unaltered if the next digit on the right is in the group of numbers $0,1,2,3$ or 4 .
For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
1.714285 \ldots & =\mathbf{1} .7 \mathbf{1 4} \text { correct to } 4 \text { significant figures } \\
& =\mathbf{1 . 7 1 4} \text { correct to } 3 \text { decimal places }
\end{aligned}$$
since the next digit on the right in this example is 2 . The last digit in the answer is increased by 1 if the next digit on the right is in the group of numbers $5,6,7,8$ or 9. For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
1.7142857 \ldots & =\mathbf{1 . 7 1 4 3} \text { correct to } 5 \text { significant figures } \\
& =\mathbf{1 . 7 1 4 3} \text { correct to } 4 \text { decimal places }
\end{aligned}$$
since the next digit on the right in this example is 8 .

\subsection*{3.4 Adding and subtracting decimal numbers}

When adding or subtracting decimal numbers, care needs to be taken to ensure that the decimal points are beneath each other. This is demonstrated in the following worked examples.

Problem 7. Evaluate $46.8+3.06+2.4+0.09$ and give the answer correct to 3 significant figures

The decimal points are placed under each other as shown. Each column is added, starting from the right.
$$\begin{gathered}
46.8 \\
3.06 \\
2.4 \\
+\underline{0.09} \\
\hline \frac{52.35}{111}
\end{gathered}$$
(i) $6+9=15$. Place 5 in the hundredths column. Carry 1 in the tenths column.
(ii) $8+0+4+0+1$ (carried) $=13$. Place the 3 in the tenths column. Carry the 1 into the units column.
(iii) $6+3+2+0+1$ (carried) $=12$. Place the 2 in the units column. Carry the 1 into the tens column.
(iv) $4+1($ carried $)=5$. Place the 5 in the hundreds column.

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
46.8+3.06+2.4+0.09 & =52.35 \\
& =52.4, \text { correct to } 3 \\
& \text { significant figures }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 8. Evaluate 64.46 - 28.77 and give the answer correct to 1 decimal place

As with addition, the decimal points are placed under each other as shown.
$$\begin{array}{r}
64.46 \\
-\underline{28.77} \\
\hline \underline{35.69}
\end{array}$$
(i) 6-7 is not possible; therefore 'borrow' 1 from the tenths column. This gives $16-7=9$. Place the 9 in the hundredths column.
(ii) 3-7 is not possible; therefore 'borrow' 1 from the units column. This gives $13-7=6$. Place the 6 in the tenths column.
(iii) $3-8$ is not possible; therefore 'borrow' from the hundreds column. This gives $13-8=5$. Place the 5 in the units column.
(iv) $5-2=3$. Place the 3 in the hundreds column.

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
64.46-28.77 & =35.69 \\
& =35.7 \text { correct to } 1 \text { decimal place }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 9. Evaluate 312.64-59.826-79.66+ 38.5 and give the answer correct to 4 significant figures

The sum of the positive decimal fractions $=312.64+38.5=351.14$.
The sum of the negative decimal fractions $=59.826+79.66=139.486$.
Taking the sum of the negative decimal fractions from the sum of the positive decimal fractions gives
$$\begin{array}{r}
351.140 \\
-\underline{139.486} \\
\hline 211.654 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Hence, $351.140-139.486=\mathbf{2 1 1 . 6 5 4}=\mathbf{2 1 1 . 7}$, correct to 4 significant figures.

\subsection*{3.5 Multiplying and dividing decimal numbers}

When multiplying decimal fractions:
(a) the numbers are multiplied as if they were integers, and
(b) the position of the decimal point in the answer is such that there are as many digits to the right of it as the sum of the digits to the right of the decimal points of the two numbers being multiplied together.

This is demonstrated in the following worked examples.

\section*{Problem 10. Evaluate $37.6 \times 5.4$}
$$\begin{array}{r}
376 \\
\times 54 \\
\hline 1504 \\
18800 \\
\hline 20304 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
(i) $376 \times 54=20304$.
(ii) As there are $1+1=2$ digits to the right of the decimal points of the two numbers being multiplied together, $37 . \underline{6} \times 5 . \underline{4}$, then
$$37.6 \times 5.4=203.04$$

Problem 11. Evaluate $44.25 \div 1.2$, correct to (a) 3 significant figures, (b) 2 decimal places
$$44.25 \div 1.2=\frac{44.25}{1.2}$$

The denominator is multiplied by 10 to change it into an integer. The numerator is also multiplied by 10 to keep the fraction the same. Thus,
$$\frac{44.25}{1.2}=\frac{44.25 \times 10}{1.2 \times 10}=\frac{442.5}{12}$$

The long division is similar to the long division of integers and the steps are as shown.
$$\begin{array}{r}
36.875 \\
\frac{36}{86} \\
\frac{72}{105} \\
\frac{96}{90} \\
\frac{84}{60} \\
\frac{60}{0}
\end{array}$$
(i) 12 into 44 goes 3; place the 3 above the second 4 of 442.500
(ii) $3 \times 12=36$; place the 36 below the 44 of 442.500
(iii) $44-36=8$.
(iv) Bring down the 2 to give 82 .
(v) 12 into 82 goes 6 ; place the 6 above the 2 of 442.500
(vi) $6 \times 12=72$; place the 72 below the 82 .
(vii) $82-72=10$.
(viii) Bring down the 5 to give 105 .
(ix) 12 into 105 goes 8 ; place the 8 above the 5 of 442.500
(x) $8 \times 12=96$; place the 96 below the 105 .
(xi) $105-96=9$.
(xii) Bring down the 0 to give 90 .
(xiii) 12 into 90 goes 7; place the 7 above the first zero of 442.500
(xiv) $7 \times 12=84$; place the 84 below the 90 .
(xv) $90-84=6$.
(xvi) Bring down the 0 to give 60 .
(xvii) 12 into 60 gives 5 exactly; place the 5 above the second zero of 442.500
(xviii) Hence, $44.25 \div 1.2=\frac{442.5}{12}=\mathbf{3 6 . 8 7 5}$

So,
(a) $44.25 \div 1.2=\mathbf{3 6} .9$, correct to $\mathbf{3}$ significant figures.
(b) $44.25 \div 1.2=\mathbf{3 6 . 8 8}$, correct to $\mathbf{2}$ decimal places.

Problem 12. Express $7 \frac{2}{3}$ as a decimal fraction, correct to 4 significant figures

Dividing 2 by 3 gives $\frac{2}{3}=0.666666 \ldots$ and $7 \frac{2}{3}=7.666666 \ldots$
Hence, $7 \frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{3}}=7.667$ correct to 4 significant figures.
Note that $7.6666 \ldots$ is called 7.6 recurring and is written as $\mathbf{7 . 6}$

\section*{Using a calculator}

\subsection*{4.1 Introduction}

In engineering, calculations often need to be performed. For simple numbers it is useful to be able to use mental arithmetic. However, when numbers are larger an electronic calculator needs to be used.
There are several calculators on the market, many of which will be satisfactory for our needs. It is essential to have a scientific notation calculator which will have all the necessary functions needed and more.
This chapter assumes you have a CASIO fx-83ES calculator, or similar, as shown in Figure 4.1.
Besides straightforward addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, which you will already be able to do, we will check that you can use squares, cubes, powers, reciprocals, roots, fractions and trigonometric functions (the latter in preparation for Chapter 21). There are several other functions on the calculator which we do not need to concern ourselves with at this level.

\subsection*{4.2 Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing}

Initially, after switching on, press Mode.
Of the three possibilities, use Comp, which is achieved by pressing 1 .
Next, press Shift followed by Setup and, of the eight possibilities, use Mth IO, which is achieved by pressing 1.
By all means experiment with the other menu options refer to your 'User's guide'.
All calculators have,$+-\mathbf{x}$ and $\div$ functions and these functions will, no doubt, already have been used in calculations.

Problem 1. Evaluate $364.7 \div 57.5$ correct to 3 decimal places
(i) Type in 364.7
(ii) Press $\div$.
(iii) Type in 57.5
(iv) $\quad$ Press $=$ and the fraction $\frac{3647}{575}$ appears.
(v) Press the $S \Leftrightarrow D$ function and the decimal answer $6.34260869 \ldots$ appears.

Alternatively, after step (iii) press Shift and = and the decimal will appear.
Hence, $364.7 \div 57.5=6.343$ correct to 3 decimal places.

Problem 2. Evaluate $\frac{12.47 \times 31.59}{70.45 \times 0.052}$ correct to 4 significant figures
(i) Type in 12.47
(ii) Press $\times$.
(iii) Type in 31.59
(iv) Press $\div$.
(v) The denominator must have brackets; i.e. press (.
(vi) Type in $70.45 \times 0.052$ and complete the bracket; i.e.).
(vii) Press $=$ and the answer $107.530518 \ldots$ appears.

Hence, $\frac{12.47 \times 31.59}{70.45 \times 0.052}=107.5$ correct to 4 significant figures.

\subsection*{4.3.5 Trigonometric functions}

Trigonometric ratios will be covered in Chapter 21. However, very briefly, there are three functions on your calculator that are involved with trigonometry. They are: sin which is an abbreviation of sine cos which is an abbreviation of cosine, and tan which is an abbreviation of tangent
Exactly what these mean will be explained in Chapter 21.
There are two main ways that angles are measured, i.e. in degrees or in radians. Pressing Shift, Setup and 3 shows degrees, and Shift, Setup and 4 shows radians. Press 3 and your calculator will be in degrees mode, indicated by a small D appearing at the top of the screen.

\subsection*{4.4 Evaluation of formulae}

The statement $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{m x}+\boldsymbol{c}$ is called a formula for $y$ in terms of $m, x$ and $c$.
$y, m, x$ and $c$ are called symbols.
When given values of $m, x$ and $c$ we can evaluate $y$.
There are a large number of formulae used in engineering and in this section we will insert numbers in place of symbols to evaluate engineering quantities.
Just four examples of important formulae are:
1. A straight line graph is of the form $y=m x+c$ (see Chapter 17).
2. Ohm's law states that $V=I \times R$.
3. Velocity is expressed as $v=u+a t$.
4. Force is expressed as $F=m \times a$.

Here are some practical examples. Check with your calculator that you agree with the working and answers.

Problem 20. In an electrical circuit the voltage $V$ is given by Ohm's law, i.e. $V=I R$. Find, correct to 4 significant figures, the voltage when $I=5.36 \mathrm{~A}$ and $R=14.76 \Omega$
$$V=I R=(5.36)$$

Hence, voltage $V=79.11 \mathrm{~V}$, correct to 4 significant figures.

Problem 21. The surface area $A$ of a hollow cone is given by $A=\pi r l$. Determine, correct to 1 decimal place, the surface area when $r=3.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $l=8.5 \mathrm{~cm}$
$$A=\pi r l=\pi(3.0)(8.5) \mathrm{cm}^{2}$$

Hence, surface area $A=80.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, correct to 1 decimal place.

Problem 22. Velocity $v$ is given by $v=u+a t$. If $u=9.54 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, a=3.67 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and $t=7.82 \mathrm{~s}$, find $v$, correct to 3 significant figures
$$\begin{aligned}
v & =u+a t=9.54+3.67 \times 7.82 \\
& =9.54+28.6994=38.2394
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, velocity $v=38.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, correct to 3 significant figures.

Problem 23. The area, $A$, of a circle is given by $A=\pi r^{2}$. Determine the area correct to 2 decimal places, given radius $r=5.23 \mathrm{~m}$
$$A=\pi r^{2}=\pi(5.23)^{2}=\pi(27.3529)$$

Hence, area, $A=\mathbf{8 5 . 9 3} \mathrm{m}^{2}$, correct to 2 decimal places.

Problem 24. Density $=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}$. Find the density when the mass is 6.45 kg and the volume is $300 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Density $=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}=\frac{6.45 \mathrm{~kg}}{300 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{3}}=\mathbf{2 1 5 0 0} \mathbf{k g} / \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}$
Problem 25. The power, $P$ watts, dissipated in an electrical circuit is given by the formula $P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$. Evaluate the power, correct to 4 significant figures, given that $V=230 V$ and $R=35.63 \Omega$
$$P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}=\frac{(230)^{2}}{35.63}=\frac{52900}{35.63}=1484.70390 \ldots$$

Press ENG and $1.48470390 \ldots \times 10^{3}$ appears on the screen.
Hence, power, $P=1485 \mathrm{~W}$ or 1.485 kW correct to 4 significant figures.

Here are some further practical examples. Again, check with your calculator that you agree with the working and answers.

Problem 26. The volume $V \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a right circular cone is given by $V=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h$. Given that radius $r=2.45 \mathrm{~cm}$ and height $h=18.7 \mathrm{~cm}$, find the volume, correct to 4 significant figures
$$\begin{aligned}
V & =\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{1}{3} \pi(2.45)^{2}(18.7) \\
& =\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 2.45^{2} \times 18.7 \\
& =117.544521 \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, volume, $V=\mathbf{1 1 7 . 5} \mathrm{cm}^{\mathbf{3}}$, correct to $\mathbf{4}$ significant figures.

Problem 27. Force $F$ newtons is given by the formula $F=\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{d^{2}}$, where $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are masses, $d$ their distance apart and $G$ is a constant. Find the value of the force given that $G=6.67 \times 10^{-11}, m_{1}=7.36, m_{2}=15.5$ and $d=22.6$. Express the answer in standard form, correct to 3 significant figures
$$\begin{aligned}
F=\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{d^{2}} & =\frac{\left(6.67 \times 10^{-11}\right)(7.36)(15.5)}{(22.6)^{2}} \\
& =\frac{(6.67)(7.36)(15.5)}{\left(10^{11}\right)(510.76)}=\frac{1.490}{10^{11}}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, force $\boldsymbol{F}=\mathbf{1 . 4 9 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }}$ newtons, correct to 3 significant figures.

Problem 28. The time of swing, $t$ seconds, of a simple pendulum is given by $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{T}{g}}$
Determine the time, correct to 3 decimal places, given that $l=12.9$ and $g=9.81$
$$t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}=(2 \pi) \sqrt{\frac{12.9}{9.81}}=7.20510343 \ldots$$

Hence, time $t=7.205$ seconds, correct to 3 decimal places.

Problem 29. Resistance, $R \Omega$, varies with temperature according to the formula $R=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$. Evaluate $R$, correct to 3 significant figures, given $R_{0}=14.59, \alpha=0.0043$ and $t=80$
$$\begin{aligned}
R=R_{0}(1+\alpha t) & =14.59[1+(0.0043)(80)] \\
& =14.59(1+0.344) \\
& =14.59(1.344)

\section*{Percentages}

\subsection*{5.1 Introduction}

Percentages are used to give a common standard. The use of percentages is very common in many aspects of commercial life, as well as in engineering. Interest rates, sale reductions, pay rises, exams and VAT are all examples of situations in which percentages are used. For this chapter you will need to know about decimals and fractions and be able to use a calculator.
We are familiar with the symbol for percentage, i.e. \%. Here are some examples.
- Interest rates indicate the cost at which we can borrow money. If you borrow $Â£ 8000$ at a $\mathbf{6 . 5 \%}$ interest rate for a year, it will cost you $6.5 \%$ of the amount borrowed to do so, which will need to be repaid along with the original money you borrowed. If you repay the loan in 1 year, how much interest will you have paid?
- A pair of trainers in a shop cost $Â£ 60$. They are advertised in a sale as $\mathbf{2 0 \%}$ off. How much will you pay?
- If you earn $Â£ 20000$ p.a. and you receive a $\mathbf{2 . 5 \%}$ pay rise, how much extra will you have to spend the following year?
- A book costing $Â£ 18$ can be purchased on the internet for $30 \%$ less. What will be its cost?

When we have completed his chapter on percentages you will be able to understand how to perform the above calculations.
Percentages are fractions having 100 as their denominator. For example, the fraction $\frac{40}{100}$ is written as $40 \%$ and is read as 'forty per cent'.
The easiest way to understand percentages is to go through some worked examples.

\subsection*{5.2 Percentage calculations}

\subsection*{5.2.1 To convert a decimal to a percentage}

A decimal number is converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 .

Problem 1. Express 0.015 as a percentage

To express a decimal number as a percentage, merely multiply by 100 , i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
0.015 & =0.015 \times 100 \% \\
& =\mathbf{1 . 5 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying a decimal number by 100 means moving the decimal point 2 places to the right.

Problem 2. Express 0.275 as a percentage
$$\begin{aligned}
0.275 & =0.275 \times 100 \% \\
& =\mathbf{2 7 . 5 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{5.2.2 To convert a percentage to a decimal}

A percentage is converted to a decimal number by dividing by 100 .

Problem 3. Express $6.5 \%$ as a decimal number
$$6.5 \%=\frac{6.5}{100}=\mathbf{0 . 0 6 5}$$

Dividing by 100 means moving the decimal point 2 places to the left.

\section*{Problem 4. Express $17.5 \%$ as a decimal number}
$$\begin{aligned}
17.5 \% & =\frac{17.5}{100} \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 1 7 5}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{5.2.3 To convert a fraction to a percentage}

A fraction is converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 .

Problem 5. Express $\frac{5}{8}$ as a percentage
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{5}{8}=\frac{5}{8} \times 100 \% & =\frac{500}{8} \% \\
& =\mathbf{6 2 . 5 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 6. Express $\frac{5}{19}$ as a percentage, correct to 2 decimal places
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{5}{19} & =\frac{5}{19} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{500}{19} \% \\
& =26.3157889 \ldots \text { by calculator } \\
& =\mathbf{2 6 . 3 2 \%} \text { correct to } \mathbf{2} \text { decimal places }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. In two successive tests a student gains marks of $57 / 79$ and 49/67. Is the second mark better or worse than the first?
$$\begin{aligned}
57 / 79 & =\frac{57}{79}=\frac{57}{79} \times 100 \%=\frac{5700}{79} \% \\
& =\mathbf{7 2 . 1 5 \%} \% \text { correct to } 2 \text { decimal places } \\
49 / 67 & =\frac{49}{67}=\frac{49}{67} \times 100 \%=\frac{4900}{67} \% \\
& =\mathbf{7 3 . 1 3} \% \text { correct to } 2 \text { decimal places }
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the second test is marginally better than the first test. This question demonstrates how much easier it is to compare two fractions when they are expressed as percentages.

\subsection*{5.2.4 To convert a percentage to a fraction}

A percentage is converted to a fraction by dividing by 100 and then, by cancelling, reducing it to its simplest form.

Problem 8. Express 75\% as a fraction
$$\begin{aligned}
75 \% & =\frac{75}{100} \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{4}}
\end{aligned}$$

The fraction $\frac{75}{100}$ is reduced to its simplest form by cancelling, i.e. dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 .

Problem 9. Express $37.5 \%$ as a fraction
$$\begin{aligned}
37.5 \% & =\frac{37.5}{100} \\
& =\frac{375}{1000} \\
& =\frac{15}{40} \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{8}}
\end{aligned}$$
by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 10 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5

\subsection*{5.3.1 Finding a percentage of a quantity}

To find a percentage of a quantity, convert the percentage to a fraction (by dividing by 100) and remember that 'of' means multiply.

\section*{Problem 10. Find $27 \%$ of $Â£ 65$}
$$\begin{aligned}
27 \% \text { of } Â£ 65 & =\frac{27}{100} \times 65 \\
& =Â£ 17.55 \text { by calculator }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 11. In a machine shop, it takes 32 minutes to machine a certain part. Using a new tool, the time can be reduced by $12.5 \%$. Calculate the new time taken
$$\begin{aligned}
12.5 \% \text { of } 32 \text { minutes } & =\frac{12.5}{100} \times 32 \\
& =4 \text { minutes }
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, new time taken $=32-4=\mathbf{2 8}$ minutes.
Alternatively, if the time is reduced by $12.5 \%$, it now takes $100 \%-12.5 \%=87.5 \%$ of the original time, i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
87.5 \% \text { of } 32 \text { minutes } & =\frac{87.5}{100} \times 32 \\
& =\mathbf{2 8} \text { minutes }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 12. A 160 GB iPod is advertised as costing $Â£ 190$ excluding VAT. If VAT is added at $17.5 \%$, what will be the total cost of the iPod?
$$\mathrm{VAT}=17.5 \% \text { of } Â£ 190=\frac{17.5}{100} \times 190=Â£ 33.25$$

Total cost of $\mathbf{i P o d}=Â£ 190+Â£ 33.25=Â£ \mathbf{2 2 3 . 2 5}$
A quicker method to determine the total cost is: $1.175 \times$ $Â£ 190=Â£ 223.25$

\subsection*{5.3.2 Expressing one quantity as a percentage of another quantity}

To express one quantity as a percentage of another quantity, divide the first quantity by the second then multiply by 100 .

Problem 13. Express 23 cm as a percentage of 72 cm , correct to the nearest $1 \%$

23 cm as a percentage of $72 \mathrm{~cm}=\frac{23}{72} \times 100 \%$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =31.94444 \ldots \% \\
& =\mathbf{3 2 \%} \% \text { correct to } \\
& \text { the nearest } 1 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 14. Express 47 minutes as a percentage of 2 hours, correct to 1 decimal place

Note that it is essential that the two quantities are in the same units.
$$\text { Working in minute units, } \begin{aligned}
2 \text { hours } & =2 \times 60 \\
& =120 \text { minutes }
\end{aligned}$$

47 minutes as a percentage
$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{array}{l}
\text { percentage } \\
\text { of } 120 \min
\end{array} & =\frac{47}{120} \times 100 \% \\
& =\mathbf{3 9 . 2 \%} \text { correct to }
\end{aligned}$$

1 decimal place

\subsection*{5.3.3 Percentage change}

Percentage change is given by
$$\frac{\text { new value }- \text { original value }}{\text { original value }} \times 100 \% \text {. }$$

Problem 15. A box of resistors increases in price from $Â£ 45$ to $Â£ 52$. Calculate the percentage change in cost, correct to 3 significant figures
$$\begin{aligned}
\% \text { change } & =\frac{\text { new value }- \text { original value }}{\text { original value }} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{52-45}{45} \times 100 \%=\frac{7}{45} \times 100 \\
& =\mathbf{1 5 . 6 \%}=\text { percentage change in cost }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 16. A drilling speed should be set to $400 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$. The nearest speed available on the machine is $412 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$. Calculate the percentage overspeed
$$\begin{aligned}
\% \text { overspeed }= & \frac{\text { available speed }- \text { correct speed }}{\text { correct speed }} \times 100 \% \\
=\frac{412-400}{400} \times 100 \% & =\frac{12}{400} \times 100 \% \\
& =\mathbf{3 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{5.4 More percentage calculations}

\subsection*{5.4.1 Percentage error}
$$\text { Percentage error }=\frac{\text { error }}{\text { correct value }} \times 100 \%$$

Problem 17. The length of a component is measured incorrectly as 64.5 mm . The actual length
is 63 mm . What is the percentage error in the measurement?
$$\begin{aligned}
\% \text { error } & =\frac{\text { error }}{\text { correct value }} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{64.5-63}{63} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{1.5}{63} \times 100 \%=\frac{150}{63} \% \\
& =\mathbf{2 . 3 8 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

The percentage measurement error is $\mathbf{2 . 3 8 \%}$ too high, which is sometimes written as $\mathbf{+ 2 . 3 8 \%}$ error.

Problem 18. The voltage across a component in an electrical circuit is calculated as 50 V using Ohm's law. When measured, the actual voltage is 50.4 V . Calculate, correct to 2 decimal places, the percentage error in the calculation
$$\begin{aligned}
\% \text { error } & =\frac{\text { error }}{\text { correct value }} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{50.4-50}{50.4} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{0.4}{50.4} \times 100 \%=\frac{40}{50.4} \% \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 7 9 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

The percentage error in the calculation is $\mathbf{0 . 7 9 \%}$ too low, which is sometimes written as $\mathbf{- 0 . 7 9 \%}$ error.

\subsection*{5.4.2 Original value}
$$\text { Original value }=\frac{\text { new value }}{100 \pm \% \text { change }} \times 100 \%$$

Problem 19. A man pays $Â£ 149.50$ in a sale for a DVD player which is labelled ' $35 \%$ off'. What was the original price of the DVD player?

In this case, it is a $35 \%$ reduction in price, so we use $\frac{\text { new value }}{100-\% \text { change }} \times 100$, i.e. a minus sign in the denominator.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Original price } & =\frac{\text { new value }}{100-\% \text { change }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{149.5}{100-35} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{149.5}{65} \times 100=\frac{14950}{65} \\
& =Â£ 230
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 20. A couple buys a flat and make an $18 \%$ profit by selling it 3 years later for $Â£ 153400$. Calculate the original cost of the house

In this case, it is an $18 \%$ increase in price, so we use $\frac{\text { new value }}{100+\% \text { change }} \times 100$, i.e. a plus sign in the denominator.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Original cost } & =\frac{\text { new value }}{100+\% \text { change }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{153400}{100+18} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{153400}{118} \times 100=\frac{15340000}{118} \\
& =\mathbf{Â£ 1 3 0 0 0 0}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 21. An electrical store makes $40 \%$ profit on each widescreen television it sells. If the selling price of a 32 inch HD television is $Â£ 630$, what was the cost to the dealer?

In this case, it is a $40 \%$ mark-up in price, so we use $\frac{\text { new value }}{100+\% \text { change }} \times 100$, i.e. a plus sign in the denominator.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Dealer cost } & =\frac{\text { new value }}{100+\% \text { change }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{630}{100+40} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{630}{140} \times 100=\frac{63000}{140} \\
& =Â£ \mathbf{Â£ 5 0}
\end{aligned}$$

The dealer buys from the manufacturer for $Â£ 450$ and sells to his customers for $Â£ 630$.

Problem 22. $Â£ 3600$ is placed in an ISA account which pays $6.25 \%$ interest per annum. How much is the investment worth after 1 year?
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Value after 1 year } & =\frac{100+6.25}{100} \times Â£ 3600 \\
& =\frac{106.25}{100} \times Â£ 3600 \\
& =1.0625 \times Â£ 3600 \\
& =Â£ 3825
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 23. The price of a fully installed combination condensing boiler is increased by $6.5 \%$. It originally cost $Â£ 2400$. What is the new price?
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { New price } & =\frac{100+6.5}{100} \times Â£ 2,400 \\
=\frac{106.5}{100} \times Â£ 2,400 & =1.065 \times Â£ 2,400 \\
& =Â£ 2,556

\section*{Ratio and proportion}

\subsection*{6.1 Introduction}

Ratio is a way of comparing amounts of something; it shows how much bigger one thing is than the other. Some practical examples include mixing paint, sand and cement, or screen wash. Gears, map scales, food recipes, scale drawings and metal alloy constituents all use ratios.

Two quantities are in direct proportion when they increase or decrease in the same ratio. There are several practical engineering laws which rely on direct proportion. Also, calculating currency exchange rates and converting imperial to metric units rely on direct proportion.

Sometimes, as one quantity increases at a particular rate, another quantity decreases at the same rate; this is called inverse proportion. For example, the time taken to do a job is inversely proportional to the number of people in a team: double the people, half the time.

When we have completed this chapter on ratio and proportion you will be able to understand, and confidently perform, calculations on the above topics.

For this chapter you will need to know about decimals and fractions and to be able to use a calculator.

\subsection*{6.2 Ratios}

Ratios are generally shown as numbers separated by a colon (:) so the ratio of 2 and 7 is written as $2: 7$ and we read it as a ratio of 'two to seven.'

Some practical examples which are familiar include:
- Mixing 1 measure of screen wash to 6 measures of water; i.e., the ratio of screen wash to water is $1: 6$
- Mixing 1 shovel of cement to 4 shovels of sand; i.e., the ratio of cement to sand is $1: 4$
- Mixing 3 parts of red paint to 1 part white, i.e., the ratio of red to white paint is $3: 1$

Ratio is the number of parts to a mix. The paint mix is 4 parts total, with 3 parts red and 1 part white. 3 parts red paint to 1 part white paint means there is
$$\frac{3}{4} \text { red paint to } \frac{1}{4} \text { white paint }$$

Here are some worked examples to help us understand more about ratios.

Problem 1. In a class, the ratio of female to male students is $6: 27$. Reduce the ratio to its simplest form
(i) Both 6 and 27 can be divided by 3 .
(ii) Thus, $6: 27$ is the same as $\mathbf{2 : 9}$.

6:27 and 2:9 are called equivalent ratios.
It is normal to express ratios in their lowest, or simplest, form. In this example, the simplest form is $2: 9$ which means for every 2 females in the class there are 9 male students.

Problem 2. A gear wheel having 128 teeth is in mesh with a 48 -tooth gear. What is the gear ratio?
$$\text { Gear ratio }=128: 48$$

A ratio can be simplified by finding common factors.
(i) 128 and 48 can both be divided by 2, i.e. 128:48 is the same as $64: 24$
(ii) 64 and 24 can both be divided by 8, i.e. $64: 24$ is the same as $8: 3$
(iii) There is no number that divides completely into both 8 and 3 so $8: 3$ is the simplest ratio, i.e. the gear ratio is $8: 3$

Thus, $128: 48$ is equivalent to $64: 24$ which is equivalent to $8: 3$ and $\mathbf{8 : 3}$ is the simplest form.

Problem 3. A wooden pole is 2.08 m long. Divide it in the ratio of 7 to 19
(i) Since the ratio is $7: 19$, the total number of parts is $7+19=26$ parts.
(ii) 26 parts corresponds to $2.08 \mathrm{~m}=208 \mathrm{~cm}$, hence, 1 part corresponds to $\frac{208}{26}=8$.
(iii) Thus, 7 parts corresponds to $7 \times 8=\mathbf{5 6} \mathbf{~ c m}$ and 19 parts corresponds to $19 \times 8=\mathbf{1 5 2} \mathbf{~ c m}$.

Hence, 2.08 m divides in the ratio of $7: 19$ as 56 cm to 152 cm .
(Check: $56+152$ must add up to 208, otherwise an error would have been made.)

Problem 4. In a competition, prize money of $Â£ 828$ is to be shared among the first three in the ratio 5:3:1
(i) Since the ratio is 5:3:1 the total number of parts is $5+3+1=9$ parts.
(ii) 9 parts corresponds to $Â£ 828$.
(iii) 1 part corresponds to $\frac{828}{9}=\mathbf{Â£ 9 2}, 3$ parts corresponds to $3 \times Â£ 92=Â£ 276$ and 5 parts corresponds to $5 \times Â£ 92=Â£ 460$.

Hence, $Â£ \mathbf{8 2 8}$ divides in the ratio of $\mathbf{5 : 3 : 1}$ as $Â£ \mathbf{4 6 0}$ to Â£276 to Â£92. (Check: $460+276+92$ must add up to 828 , otherwise an error would have been made.)

Problem 5. A map scale is $1: 30000$. On the map the distance between two schools is 6 cm .
Determine the actual distance between the schools, giving the answer in kilometres

Actual distance between schools
$$\begin{aligned}
& =6 \times 30000 \mathrm{~cm}=180000 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =\frac{180,000}{100} \mathrm{~m}=1800 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =\frac{1800}{1000} \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{1 . 8 0} \mathbf{~ k m}
\end{aligned}$$
( 1 mile $\approx 1.6 \mathrm{~km}$, hence the schools are just over 1 mile apart.)

Problem 6. Express 45 p as a ratio of $Â£ 7.65$ in its simplest form
(i) Changing both quantities to the same units, i.e. to pence, gives a ratio of $45: 765$
(ii) Dividing both quantities by 5 gives $45: 765 \equiv 9: 153$
(iii) Dividing both quantities by 3 gives $9: 153 \equiv 3: 51$
(iv) Dividing both quantities by 3 again gives $3: 51 \equiv 1: 17$

\section*{Thus, $\mathbf{4 5} \mathbf{p}$ as a ratio of $Â£ 7.65$ is $\mathbf{1 : 1 7}$}
$45: 765,9: 153,3: 51$ and $1: 17$ are equivalent ratios and $1: 17$ is the simplest ratio.

Problem 7. A glass contains 30 ml of whisky which is $40 \%$ alcohol. If 45 ml of water is added and the mixture stirred, what is now the alcohol content?
(i) The 30 ml of whisky contains $40 \%$ alcohol $=\frac{40}{100} \times 30=12 \mathrm{ml}$.
(ii) After 45 ml of water is added we have $30+45$ $=75 \mathrm{ml}$ of fluid, of which alcohol is 12 ml .
(iii) Fraction of alcohol present $=\frac{12}{75}$
(iv) Percentage of alcohol present $=\frac{12}{75} \times 100 \%$ $=16 \%$.

Problem 8. 20 tonnes of a mixture of sand and gravel is $30 \%$ sand. How many tonnes of sand must be added to produce a mixture which is $40 \%$ gravel?
(i) Amount of sand in 20 tonnes $=30 \%$ of $20 t$ $=\frac{30}{100} \times 20=6 \mathrm{t}$.
(ii) If the mixture has 6 t of sand then amount of gravel $=20-6=14 \mathrm{t}$.
(iii) We want this 14 t of gravel to be $40 \%$ of the new mixture. $1 \%$ would be $\frac{14}{40} \mathrm{t}$ and $100 \%$ of the mixture would be $\frac{14}{40} \times 100 \mathrm{t}=35 \mathrm{t}$.
(iv) If there is 14 t of gravel then amount of sand $=35-14=21 \mathrm{t}$.
(v) We already have $6 t$ of sand, so amount of sand to be added to produce a mixture with $40 \%$ gravel $=21-6=15 \mathbf{t}$.

\subsection*{6.3 Direct proportion}

Two quantities are in direct proportion when they increase or decrease in the same ratio. For example, if 12 cans of lager have a mass of 4 kg , then 24 cans of lager will have a mass of 8 kg ; i.e., if the quantity of cans doubles then so does the mass. This is direct proportion.

In the previous section we had an example of mixing 1 shovel of cement to 4 shovels of sand; i.e., the ratio of cement to sand was $1: 4$. So, if we have a mix of 10 shovels of cement and 40 shovels of sand and we wanted to double the amount of the mix then we would need to double both the cement and sand, i.e. 20 shovels of cement and 80 shovels of sand. This is another example of direct proportion.
Here are three laws in engineering which involve direct proportion:
(a) Hooke's law states that, within the elastic limit of a material, the strain $\varepsilon$ produced is directly proportional to the stress $\sigma$ producing it, i.e. $\varepsilon \propto \sigma$ (note than ' $\alpha$ ' means 'is proportional to').
(b) Charles's law states that, for a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume $V$ is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature $T$, i.e. $V \propto T$.
(c) Ohm's law states that the current $I$ flowing through a fixed resistance is directly proportional to the applied voltage $V$, i.e. $I \propto V$.

Here are some worked examples to help us understand more about direct proportion.

Problem 9. 3 energy saving light bulbs cost $Â£ 7.80$. Determine the cost of 7 such light bulbs
(i) 3 light bulbs cost $Â£ 7.80$
(ii) Therefore, 1 light bulb costs $\frac{7.80}{3}=Â£ 2.60$

Hence, 7 light bulbs cost $7 \times Â£ 2.60=Â£ \mathbf{1 8 . 2 0}$
Problem 10. If 56 litres of petrol costs $Â£ 59.92$, calculate the cost of 32 litres
(i) 56 litres of petrol costs $Â£ 59.92$
(ii) Therefore, 1 litre of petrol costs $\frac{59.92}{56}=Â£ 1.07$

Hence, $\mathbf{3 2}$ litres cost $32 \times 1.07=\mathbf{Â£ 3 4 . 2 4}$

Problem 11. Hooke's law states that stress, $\sigma$, is directly proportional to strain, $\varepsilon$, within the elastic limit of a material. When, for mild steel, the stress is 63 MPa , the strain is 0.0003 . Determine (a) the value of strain when the stress is 42 MPa , (b) the value of stress when the strain is 0.00072
(a) Stress is directly proportional to strain.
(i) When the stress is 63 MPa , the strain is 0.0003
(ii) Hence, a stress of 1 MPa corresponds to a strain of $\frac{0.0003}{63}$
(iii) Thus, the value of strain when the stress is $\mathbf{4 2} \mathbf{M P a}=\frac{0.0003}{63} \times 42=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 0 2}$
(b) Strain is proportional to stress.
(i) When the strain is 0.0003 , the stress is 63 MPa .
(ii) Hence, a strain of 0.0001 corresponds to $\frac{63}{3} \mathrm{MPa}$.
(iii) Thus, the value of stress when the strain is $0.00072=\frac{63}{3} \times 7.2=151.2 \mathrm{MPa}$.

Problem 12. Charles's law states that for a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature. A gas occupies a volume of 2.4 litres
at 600 K . Determine (a) the temperature when the volume is 3.2 litres, (b) the volume at 540 K
(a) Volume is directly proportional to temperature.
(i) When the volume is 2.4 litres, the temperature is 600 K .
(ii) Hence, a volume of 1 litre corresponds to a temperature of $\frac{600}{2.4} \mathrm{~K}$.
(iii) Thus, the temperature when the volume is 3.2 litres $=\frac{600}{2.4} \times 3.2=\mathbf{8 0 0} \mathrm{K}$.
(b) Temperature is proportional to volume.
(i) When the temperature is 600 K , the volume is 2.4 litres.
(ii) Hence, a temperature of 1 K corresponds to a volume of $\frac{2.4}{600}$ litres.
(iii) Thus, the volume at a temperature of $\mathbf{5 4 0} \mathbf{K}=\frac{2.4}{600} \times 540=\mathbf{2 . 1 6}$ litres.

Here are some further worked examples on direct proportion.

Problem 13. Some guttering on a house has to decline by 3 mm for every 70 cm to allow rainwater to drain. The gutter spans 8.4 m . How much lower should the low end be?
(i) The guttering has to decline in the ratio 3:700 or $\frac{3}{700}$
(ii) If $d$ is the vertical drop in 8.4 m or 8400 mm , then the decline must be in the ratio $d: 8400$ or $\frac{d}{8400}$
(iii) Now $\frac{d}{8400}=\frac{3}{700}$
(iv) Cross-multiplying gives $700 \times d=8400 \times 3$ from which,
$$d=\frac{8400 \times 3}{700}$$
i.e. $d=36 \mathrm{~mm}$, which is how much the lower end should be to allow rainwater to drain.

(a) Current is directly proportional to the voltage.
(i) When voltage is 90 mV , the current is 3 A .
(ii) Hence, a voltage of 1 mV corresponds to a current of $\frac{3}{90} \mathrm{~A}$.
(iii) Thus, when the voltage is 60 mV , the current $=60 \times \frac{3}{90}=\mathbf{2 A}$.
(b) Voltage is directly proportional to the current.
(i) When current is 3 A , the voltage is 90 mV .
(ii) Hence, a current of 1 A corresponds to a voltage of $\frac{90}{3} \mathrm{mV}=30 \mathrm{mV}$.
(iii) Thus, when the current is 4.2 A , the voltage $=30 \times 4.2=\mathbf{1 2 6} \mathbf{m V}$.

\subsection*{6.4 Inverse proportion}

Two variables, $x$ and $y$, are in inverse proportion to one another if $y$ is proportional to $\frac{1}{x}$, i.e. $y \alpha \frac{1}{x}$ or $y=\frac{k}{x}$ or $k=x y$ where $k$ is a constant, called the coefficient of proportionality.
Inverse proportion means that, as the value of one variable increases, the value of another decreases, and that their product is always the same.
For example, the time for a journey is inversely proportional to the speed of travel. So, if at $30 \mathrm{~m} . \mathrm{p} . \mathrm{h}$. a journey is completed in 20 minutes, then at $60 \mathrm{~m} . \mathrm{p} . \mathrm{h}$. the journey would be completed in 10 minutes. Double the speed, half the journey time. (Note that $30 \times 20=60 \times 10$.) In another example, the time needed to dig a hole is inversely proportional to the number of people digging. So, if 4 men take 3 hours to dig a hole, then 2 men
(working at the same rate) would take 6 hours. Half the men, twice the time. (Note that $4 \times 3=2 \times 6$.)
Here are some worked examples on inverse proportion.

If 5 people take 4 hours to deliver the leaflets, then 1 person would take $5 \times 4=20$ hours. Hence, 3 people would take $\frac{20}{3}$ hours, i.e. $6 \frac{2}{3}$ hours, i.e. 6 hours 40 minutes.

Problem 19. The electrical resistance $R$ of a piece of wire is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$. When $A=5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$, $R=7.02$ ohms. Determine (a) the coefficient of proportionality and (b) the cross-sectional area when the resistance is 4 ohms
(a) $R \alpha \frac{1}{A}$, i.e. $R=\frac{k}{A}$ or $k=R A$. Hence, when $R=7.2$ and $A=5$, the
coefficient of proportionality, $k=(7.2)(5)=\mathbf{3 6}$
(b) Since $k=R A$ then $A=\frac{k}{R}$. Hence, when $R=4$, the cross sectional area, $A=\frac{36}{4}=9 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$

Problem 20. Boyle's law states that, at constant temperature, the volume $V$ of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its absolute pressure $p$. If a gas occupies a volume of $0.08 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ at a pressure of
$1.5 \times 10^{6}$ pascals, determine (a) the coefficient of proportionality and (b) the volume if the pressure is changed to $4 \times 10^{6}$ pascals
(a) $\quad V \propto \frac{1}{p}$ i.e. $V=\frac{k}{p}$ or $k=p V$. Hence, the coefficient of proportionality, $\boldsymbol{k}$
$$=\left(1.5 \times 10^{6}\right)(0.08)=\mathbf{0 . 1 2} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{6}}$$
(b) Volume, $\boldsymbol{V}=\frac{k}{p}=\frac{0.12 \times 10^{6}}{4 \times 10^{6}}=\mathbf{0 . 0 3} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}$

\section*{Powers, roots and laws of indices}

\subsection*{7.1 Introduction}

The manipulation of powers and roots is a crucial underlying skill needed in algebra. In this chapter, powers and roots of numbers are explained, together with the laws of indices.
Many worked examples are included to help understanding.

\subsection*{7.2 Powers and roots}

\subsection*{7.2.1 Indices}

The number 16 is the same as $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$, and $2 \times 2 \times$ $2 \times 2$ can be abbreviated to $2^{4}$. When written as $2^{4}, 2$ is called the base and the 4 is called the index or power. $2^{4}$ is read as 'two to the power of four'.
Similarly, $3^{5}$ is read as 'three to the power of 5 '.
When the indices are 2 and 3 they are given special names; i.e. 2 is called 'squared' and 3 is called 'cubed'. Thus,
$4^{2}$ is called 'four squared' rather than ' 4 to the power of 2' and
$5^{3}$ is called 'five cubed' rather than ' 5 to the power of 3 ' When no index is shown, the power is 1 . For example, 2 means $2^{1}$.

Problem 1. Evaluate (a) $2^{6}$ (b) $3^{4}$
(a) $2^{6}$ means $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$ (i.e. 2 multiplied by itself 6 times), and $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2=\mathbf{6 4}$ i.e.
$$2^{6}=64$$
(b) $3^{4}$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ (i.e. 3 multiplied by itself 4 times), and $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3=\mathbf{8 1}$
i.e.
$$3^{4}=81$$

Problem 2. Change the following to index form: (a) 32 (b) 625
(a) (i) To express 32 in its lowest factors, 32 is initially divided by the lowest prime number, i.e. 2 .
(ii) $32 \div 2=16$, hence $32=2 \times 16$.
(iii) 16 is also divisible by 2 , i.e. $16=2 \times 8$. Thus, $32=2 \times 2 \times 8$.
(iv) 8 is also divisible by 2 , i.e. $8=2 \times 4$. Thus, $32=2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 4$.
(v) 4 is also divisible by 2 , i.e. $4=2 \times 2$. Thus, $32=2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$.
(vi) Thus, $32=\mathbf{2}^{\mathbf{5}}$.
(b) (i) 625 is not divisible by the lowest prime number, i.e. 2. The next prime number is 3 and 625 is not divisible by 3 either. The next prime number is 5 .
(ii) $625 \div 5=125$, i.e. $625=5 \times 125$.
(iii) 125 is also divisible by 5 , i.e. $125=5 \times 25$. Thus, $625=5 \times 5 \times 25$.
(iv) 25 is also divisible by 5, i.e. $25=5 \times 5$. Thus, $625=5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5$.
(v) Thus, $\mathbf{6 2 5}=\mathbf{5}^{4}$.

Problem 3. Evaluate $3^{3} \times 2^{2}$
$$\begin{aligned}
3^{3} \times 2^{2} & =3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 \\
& =27 \times 4 \\
& =\mathbf{1 0 8}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{7.2.2 Square roots}

When a number is multiplied by itself the product is called a square.
For example, the square of 3 is $3 \times 3=3^{2}=9$.
A square root is the reverse process; i.e., the value of the base which when multiplied by itself gives the number; i.e., the square root of 9 is 3 .

The symbol $\sqrt{ }$ is used to denote a square root. Thus, $\sqrt{9}=3$. Similarly, $\sqrt{4}=2$ and $\sqrt{25}=5$.
Because $-3 \times-3=9, \sqrt{9}$ also equals -3 . Thus, $\sqrt{9}=$ +3 or -3 which is usually written as $\sqrt{9}= \pm 3$. Similarly, $\sqrt{16}= \pm 4$ and $\sqrt{36}= \pm 6$.
The square root of, say, 9 may also be written in index form as $9^{\frac{1}{2}}$.
$$9^{\frac{1}{2}} \equiv \sqrt{9}= \pm 3$$

Problem 4. Evaluate $\frac{3^{2} \times 2^{3} \times \sqrt{36}}{\sqrt{16} \times 4}$ taking only positive square roots
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3^{2} \times 2^{3} \times \sqrt{36}}{\sqrt{16} \times 4} & =\frac{3 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 6}{4 \times 4} \\
& =\frac{9 \times 8 \times 6}{16}=\frac{9 \times 1 \times 6}{2} \\
& =\frac{9 \times 1 \times 3}{1} \quad \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\mathbf{2 7}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. Evaluate $\frac{10^{4} \times \sqrt{100}}{10^{3}}$ taking the positive square root only
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{10^{4} \times \sqrt{100}}{10^{3}} & =\frac{10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10}{10 \times 10 \times 10} \\
& =\frac{1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 10 \times 10}{1 \times 1 \times 1} \quad \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{100}{1} \\
& =\mathbf{1 0 0}
\end{aligned}$$

10. $\frac{2^{5} \times 64^{\frac{1}{2}} \times 3^{2}}{\sqrt{144} \times 3}$ taking positive square roots only.

\subsection*{7.3 Laws of indices}

There are six laws of indices.
(1)
$$\text { From earlier, } \begin{aligned}
2^{2} \times 2^{3} & =(2 \times 2) \times(2 \times 2 \times 2) \\
& =32 \\
& =2^{5}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$2^{2} \times 2^{3}=2^{5}$$
or
$$2^{2} \times 2^{3}=2^{2+3}$$

This is the first law of indices, which demonstrates that when multiplying two or more numbers having the same base, the indices are added.
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2^{5}}{2^{3}}=\frac{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}{2 \times 2 \times 2} & =\frac{1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2}{1 \times 1 \times 1} \\
& =\frac{2 \times 2}{1}=4=2^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\frac{2^{5}}{2^{3}}=2^{2} \quad$ or $\quad \frac{2^{5}}{2^{3}}=2^{5-3}$
This is the second law of indices, which demonstrates that when dividing two numbers having the same base, the index in the denominator is subtracted from the index in the numerator.
(3) $\left(3^{5}\right)^{2}=3^{5 \times 2}=3^{10}$ and $\left(2^{2}\right)^{3}=2^{2 \times 3}=2^{6}$

This is the third law of indices, which demonstrates that when a number which is raised to a power is raised to a further power, the indices are multiplied.
(4) $3^{0}=1$ and $17^{0}=1$

This is the fourth law of indices, which states that when a number has an index of 0 , its value is 1 .
(5) $3^{-4}=\frac{1}{3^{4}} \quad$ and $\quad \frac{1}{2^{-3}}=2^{3}$

This is the fifth law of indices, which demonstrates that a number raised to a negative power is the reciprocal of that number raised to a positive power.
(6) $8^{\frac{2}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{8^{2}}=(2)^{2}=4$ and
$25^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[2]{25^{1}}=\sqrt{25^{1}}= \pm 5$
(Note that $\sqrt{ } \equiv \sqrt[2]{ }$ )
This is the sixth law of indices, which demonstrates that when a number is raised to a fractional power the denominator of the fraction is the root of the number and the numerator is the power.
Here are some worked examples using the laws of indices.

\section*{Problem 6. Evaluate in index form $5^{3} \times 5 \times 5^{2}$}
$$\begin{aligned}
5^{3} \times 5 \times 5^{2} & =5^{3} \times 5^{1} \times 5^{2} \\
& =5^{3+1+2} \\
& =\mathbf{5}^{\mathbf{6}}
\end{aligned}$$
(Note that 5 means $5^{1}$ )
from law (1)

Problem 7. Evaluate $\frac{3^{5}}{3^{4}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3^{5}}{3^{4}} & =3^{5-4} \\
& =3^{1} \\
& =\mathbf{3}
\end{aligned}$$
from law (2)

Problem 8. Evaluate $\frac{2^{4}}{2^{4}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2^{4}}{2^{4}} & =2^{4-4} \\
& =2^{0}
\end{aligned}$$
from law (2)

But $\quad \frac{2^{4}}{2^{4}}=\frac{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}=\frac{16}{16}=1$
Hence,
$$2^{0}=1$$
from law (4)
Any number raised to the power of zero equals 1. For example, $6^{0}=1,128^{0}=1,13742^{0}=1$ and so on.

Problem 9. Evaluate $\frac{3 \times 3^{2}}{3^{4}}$
$\frac{3 \times 3^{2}}{3^{4}}=\frac{3^{1} \times 3^{2}}{3^{4}}=\frac{3^{1+2}}{3^{4}}=\frac{3^{3}}{3^{4}}=3^{3-4}=3^{-1}$
from laws (1) and (2)
But $\quad \frac{3^{3}}{3^{4}}=\frac{3 \times 3 \times 3}{3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3}=\frac{1 \times 1 \times 1}{1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 3}$
(by cancelling)
$$=\frac{1}{3}$$

Hence, $\quad \frac{3 \times 3^{2}}{3^{4}}=\mathbf{3}^{\mathbf{- 1}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}} \quad$ from law (5)
Similarly, $\quad 2^{-1}=\frac{1}{2}, 2^{-5}=\frac{1}{2^{5}}, \frac{1}{5^{4}}=5^{-4}$ and so on.

Problem 10. Evaluate $\frac{10^{3} \times 10^{2}}{10^{8}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{10^{3} \times 10^{2}}{10^{8}}=\frac{10^{3+2}}{10^{8}} & =\frac{10^{5}}{10^{8}} & & \text { from law (1) } \\
& =10^{5-8}=10^{-3} & & \text { from law (2) } \\
& =\frac{1}{10^{+3}}=\frac{1}{1000} & & \text { from law (5) }
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad \frac{10^{3} \times 10^{2}}{10^{8}}=\mathbf{1 0}^{-\mathbf{3}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1 0 0 0}}=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 1}$
Understanding powers of ten is important, especially when dealing with prefixes in Chapter 8. For example,
$$\begin{gathered}
10^{2}=100,10^{3}=1000,10^{4}=10000 \\
10^{5}=100000,10^{6}=1000000 \\
10^{-1}=\frac{1}{10}=0.1,10^{-2}=\frac{1}{10^{2}}=\frac{1}{100}=0.01
\end{gathered}$$
and so on.

Problem 11. Evaluate (a) $5^{2} \times 5^{3} \div 5^{4}$
(b) $\left(3 \times 3^{5}\right) \div\left(3^{2} \times 3^{3}\right)$

From laws (1) and (2):
(a) $5^{2} \times 5^{3} \div 5^{4}=\frac{5^{2} \times 5^{3}}{5^{4}}=\frac{5^{(2+3)}}{5^{4}}$
$$=\frac{5^{5}}{5^{4}}=5^{(5-4)}=5^{1}=\mathbf{5}$$
(b) $\left(3 \times 3^{5}\right) \div\left(3^{2} \times 3^{3}\right)=\frac{3 \times 3^{5}}{3^{2} \times 3^{3}}=\frac{3^{(1+5)}}{3^{(2+3)}}$
$$=\frac{3^{6}}{3^{5}}=3^{6-5}=3^{1}=\mathbf{3}$$

Problem 12. Simplify (a) $\left(2^{3}\right)^{4}$ (b) $\left(3^{2}\right)^{5}$, expressing the answers in index form

From law (3):
(a) $\left(2^{3}\right)^{4}=2^{3 \times 4}=\mathbf{2}^{\mathbf{1 2}}$
(b) $\left(3^{2}\right)^{5}=3^{2 \times 5}=3^{10}$

\section*{Problem 13. Evaluate: $\frac{\left(10^{2}\right)^{3}}{10^{4} \times 10^{2}}$}

From laws (1) to (4):
$$\frac{\left(10^{2}\right)^{3}}{10^{4} \times 10^{2}}=\frac{10^{(2 \times 3)}}{10^{(4+2)}}=\frac{10^{6}}{10^{6}}=10^{6-6}=10^{0}=\mathbf{1}$$

Problem 14. Find the value of (a) $\frac{2^{3} \times 2^{4}}{2^{7} \times 2^{5}}$
(b) $\frac{\left(3^{2}\right)^{3}}{3 \times 3^{9}}$

From the laws of indices:
(a) $\frac{2^{3} \times 2^{4}}{2^{7} \times 2^{5}}=\frac{2^{(3+4)}}{2^{(7+5)}}=\frac{2^{7}}{2^{12}}=2^{7-12}$
$$=2^{-5}=\frac{1}{2^{5}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3 2}}$$
(b) $\frac{\left(3^{2}\right)^{3}}{3 \times 3^{9}}=\frac{3^{2 \times 3}}{3^{1+9}}=\frac{3^{6}}{3^{10}}=3^{6-10}$
$$=3^{-4}=\frac{1}{3^{4}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{8 1}}$$

Problem 15. Evaluate (a) $4^{1 / 2}$ (b) $16^{3 / 4}$ (c) $27^{2 / 3}$ (d) $9^{-1 / 2}$
(a) $4^{1 / 2}=\sqrt{4}=\mathbf{~} \mathbf{2}$
(b) $16^{3 / 4}=\sqrt[4]{16^{3}}=(2)^{3}=\mathbf{8}$
(Note that it does not matter whether the 4th root of 16 is found first or whether 16 cubed is found first - the same answer will result.)
(c) $27^{2 / 3}=\sqrt[3]{27^{2}}=(3)^{2}=\mathbf{9}$
(d) $9^{-1 / 2}=\frac{1}{9^{1 / 2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{9}}=\frac{1}{ \pm 3}= \pm \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}$

20. $\frac{5^{-7} \times 5^{2}}{5^{-8} \times 5^{3}}$

Here are some further worked examples using the laws of indices.

Problem 16. Evaluate $\frac{3^{3} \times 5^{7}}{5^{3} \times 3^{4}}$

The laws of indices only apply to terms having the same base. Grouping terms having the same base and then applying the laws of indices to each of the groups independently gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3^{3} \times 5^{7}}{5^{3} \times 3^{4}}=\frac{3^{3}}{3^{4}} \times \frac{5^{7}}{5^{3}} & =3^{(3-4)} \times 5^{(7-3)} \\
& =3^{-1} \times 5^{4}=\frac{5^{4}}{3^{1}}=\frac{625}{3}=\mathbf{2 0 8} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 17. Find the value of $\frac{2^{3} \times 3^{5} \times\left(7^{2}\right)^{2}}{7^{4} \times 2^{4} \times 3^{3}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2^{3} \times 3^{5} \times\left(7^{2}\right)^{2}}{7^{4} \times 2^{4} \times 3^{3}} & =2^{3-4} \times 3^{5-3} \times 7^{2 \times 2-4} \\
& =2^{-1} \times 3^{2} \times 7^{0} \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 3^{2} \times 1=\frac{9}{2}=\mathbf{4} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 18. Evaluate $\frac{4^{1.5} \times 8^{1 / 3}}{2^{2} \times 32^{-2 / 5}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& 4^{1.5}=4^{3 / 2}=\sqrt{4^{3}}=2^{3}=8,8^{1 / 3}=\sqrt[3]{8}=2 \\
& 2^{2}=4,32^{-2 / 5}=\frac{1}{32^{2 / 5}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt[5]{32^{2}}}=\frac{1}{2^{2}}=\frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\frac{4^{1.5} \times 8^{1 / 3}}{2^{2} \times 32^{-2 / 5}}=\frac{8 \times 2}{4 \times \frac{1}{4}}=\frac{16}{1}=\mathbf{1 6}$
Alternatively,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{4^{1.5} \times 8^{1 / 3}}{2^{2} \times 32^{-2 / 5}} & =\frac{\left[(2)^{2}\right]^{3 / 2} \times\left(2^{3}\right)^{1 / 3}}{2^{2} \times\left(2^{5}\right)^{-2 / 5}} \\
& =\frac{2^{3} \times 2^{1}}{2^{2} \times 2^{-2}}=2^{3+1-2-(-2)}=2^{4}=\mathbf{1 6}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 19. Evaluate $\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}+3^{3} \times 5^{3}}{3^{4} \times 5^{4}}$

Dividing each term by the HCF (highest common factor) of the three terms, i.e. $3^{2} \times 5^{3}$, gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}+3^{3} \times 5^{3}}{3^{4} \times 5^{4}} & =\frac{\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}+\frac{3^{3} \times 5^{3}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}}{\frac{3^{4} \times 5^{4}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}} \\
& =\frac{3^{(2-2)} \times 5^{(5-3)}+3^{(3-2)} \times 5^{0}}{3^{(4-2)} \times 5^{(4-3)}} \\
& =\frac{3^{0} \times 5^{2}+3^{1} \times 5^{0}}{3^{2} \times 5^{1}} \\
& =\frac{1 \times 25+3 \times 1}{9 \times 5}=\frac{\mathbf{2 8}}{\mathbf{4 5}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 20. Find the value of $\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}}{3^{4} \times 5^{4}+3^{3} \times 5^{3}}$
To simplify the arithmetic, each term is divided by the HCF of all the terms, i.e. $3^{2} \times 5^{3}$. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}}{3^{4} \times 5^{4}+3^{3} \times 5^{3}} & =\frac{\frac{3^{2} \times 5^{5}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}}{\frac{3^{4} \times 5^{4}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}+\frac{3^{3} \times 5^{3}}{3^{2} \times 5^{3}}} \\
& =\frac{3^{(2-2)} \times 5^{(5-3)}}{3^{(4-2)} \times 5^{(4-3)}+3^{(3-2)} \times 5^{(3-3)}} \\
& =\frac{3^{0} \times 5^{2}}{3^{2} \times 5^{1}+3^{1} \times 5^{0}} \\
& =\frac{1 \times 5^{2}}{3^{2} \times 5+3 \times 1}=\frac{25}{45+3}=\frac{\mathbf{2 5}}{\mathbf{4 8}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 21. Simplify $\frac{7^{-3} \times 3^{4}}{3^{-2} \times 7^{5} \times 5^{-2}}$ expressing the answer in index form with positive indices

Since $7^{-3}=\frac{1}{7^{3}}, \frac{1}{3^{-2}}=3^{2}$ and $\frac{1}{5^{-2}}=5^{2}$, then
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{7^{-3} \times 3^{4}}{3^{-2} \times 7^{5} \times 5^{-2}} & =\frac{3^{4} \times 3^{2} \times 5^{2}}{7^{3} \times 7^{5}} \\
& =\frac{3^{(4+2)} \times 5^{2}}{7^{(3+5)}}=\frac{\mathbf{3}^{\mathbf{6}} \times \mathbf{5}^{\mathbf{2}}}{\mathbf{7}^{\mathbf{8}}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 22. Simplify $\frac{16^{2} \times 9^{-2}}{4 \times 3^{3}-2^{-3} \times 8^{2}}$ expressing the answer in index form with positive indices

Expressing the numbers in terms of their lowest prime numbers gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{16^{2} \times 9^{-2}}{4 \times 3^{3}-2^{-3} \times 8^{2}} & =\frac{\left(2^{4}\right)^{2} \times\left(3^{2}\right)^{-2}}{2^{2} \times 3^{3}-2^{-3} \times\left(2^{3}\right)^{2}} \\
& =\frac{2^{8} \times 3^{-4}}{2^{2} \times 3^{3}-2^{-3} \times 2^{6}} \\
& =\frac{2^{8} \times 3^{-4}}{2^{2} \times 3^{3}-2^{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing each term by the HCF (i.e. $2^{2}$ ) gives
$$\frac{2^{8} \times 3^{-4}}{2^{2} \times 3^{3}-2^{3}}=\frac{2^{6} \times 3^{-4}}{3^{3}-2}=\frac{\mathbf{2}^{\mathbf{6}}}{\mathbf{3}^{\mathbf{4}}\left(\mathbf{3}^{\mathbf{3}}-\mathbf{2}\right)}$$

Problem 23. Simplify $\frac{\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{3} \times\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{-2}}{\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{-3}}$ giving the answer with positive indices

Raising a fraction to a power means that both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction are raised to that power, i.e. $\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{3}=\frac{4^{3}}{3^{3}}$
A fraction raised to a negative power has the same value as the inverse of the fraction raised to a positive power.

Thus, $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{-2}=\frac{1}{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{\frac{3^{2}}{5^{2}}}=1 \times \frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}}=\frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}}$
Similarly, $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{-3}=\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{3}=\frac{5^{3}}{2^{3}}$
Thus, $\frac{\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{3} \times\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{-2}}{\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{-3}}=\frac{\frac{4^{3}}{3^{3}} \times \frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}}}{\frac{5^{3}}{2^{3}}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{4^{3}}{3^{3}} \times \frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}} \times \frac{2^{3}}{5^{3}}=\frac{\left(2^{2}\right)^{3} \times 2^{3}}{3^{(3+2)} \times 5^{(3-2)}} \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{2}^{9}}{\mathbf{3}^{5} \times \mathbf{5}}
\end{aligned}$$

\title{
Units, prefixes and engineering notation
}

\subsection*{8.1 Introduction}

Of considerable importance in engineering is a knowledge of units of engineering quantities, the prefixes used with units, and engineering notation.
We need to know, for example, that
$$\begin{aligned}
& \quad 80 \mathrm{kV}=80 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~V} \text {, which means } 80000 \text { volts } \\
& \text { and } \quad 25 \mathrm{~mA}=25 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}, \\
& \text { which means } 0.025 \text { amperes } \\
& \text { and } \quad 50 \mathrm{nF}=50 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~F}, \\
& \quad \text { which means } 0.000000050 \text { farads }
\end{aligned}$$

This is explained in this chapter.

\subsection*{8.2 SI units}

The system of units used in engineering and science is the SystÃ¨me Internationale d'UnitÃ©s (International System of Units), usually abbreviated to SI units, and is based on the metric system. This was introduced in 1960 and has now been adopted by the majority of countries as the official system of measurement.
The basic seven units used in the SI system are listed in Table 8.1 with their symbols.
There are, of course, many units other than these seven. These other units are called derived units and are defined in terms of the standard units listed in the table. For example, speed is measured in metres per second, therefore using two of the standard units, i.e. length and time.

Table 8.1 Basic SI units
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Quantity & Unit & Symbol \\
\hline Length & metre & m ( $1 \mathrm{~m}=100 \mathrm{~cm}$ $=1000 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) \\
\hline Mass & kilograÄ± & $\mathrm{kg}(1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000 \mathrm{~g})$ \\
\hline Time & second & s \\
\hline Electric current & ampere & A \\
\hline Thermodynamic temperature & kelvin & K (K $\left.={ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}+273\right)$ \\
\hline Luminous intensity & candela & cd \\
\hline Amount of substance & mole & mol \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Some derived units are given special names. For example, force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration has units of kilogram metre per second squared, which uses three of the base units, i.e. kilograms, metres and seconds. The unit of kg $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ is given the special name of a Newton.
Table 8.2 contains a list of some quantities and their units that are common in engineering.

\subsection*{8.3 Common prefixes}

SI units may be made larger or smaller by using prefixes which denote multiplication or division by a particular amount.

Table 8.2 Some quantities and their units that are common in engineering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Quantity & Unit & Symbol \\
\hline Length & metre & m \\
\hline Area & square metre & $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ \\
\hline Volume & cubic metre & $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ \\
\hline Mass & kilogram & kg \\
\hline Time & second & s \\
\hline Electric current & ampere & A \\
\hline Speed, velocity & metre per second & m/s \\
\hline Acceleration & metre per second squared & $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ \\
\hline Density & kilogram per cubic metre & $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ \\
\hline Temperature & kelvin or Celsius & K or ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ \\
\hline Angle & radian or degree & rad or ${ }^{\circ}$ \\
\hline Angular velocity & radian per second & $\mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ \\
\hline Frequency & hertz & Hz \\
\hline Force & newton & N \\
\hline Pressure & pascal & Pa \\
\hline Energy, work & joule & J \\
\hline Power & watt & W \\
\hline Charge, quantity of electricity & coulomb & C \\
\hline Electric potential & volt & V \\
\hline Capacitance & farad & F \\
\hline Electrical resistance & ohm & $\Omega$ \\
\hline Inductance & henry & H \\
\hline Moment of force & newton metre & Nm \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The most common multiples are listed in Table 8.3. A knowledge of indices is needed since all of the prefixes are powers of 10 with indices that are a multiple of 3 . Here are some examples of prefixes used with engineering units.
A frequency of $\mathbf{1 5 ~ G H z}$ means $15 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~Hz}$, which is 15000000000 hertz, i.e. 15 gigahertz is written as 15 GHz and is equal to 15 thousand million hertz.
(Instead of writing 15000000000 hertz, it is much neater, takes up less space and prevents errors caused
by having so many zeros, to write the frequency as 15 GHz.$)$
A voltage of 40 MV means $40 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~V}$, which is 40000000 volts,
i.e. 40 megavolts is written as 40 MV and is equal to 40 million volts.
An inductance of $\mathbf{1 2} \mathbf{~ m H}$ means $12 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{H}$ or $\frac{12}{10^{3}} \mathrm{H}$ or $\frac{12}{1000} \mathrm{H}$, which is 0.012 H ,
i.e. 12 millihenrys is written as 12 mH and is equal to 12 thousandths of a henry.

Table 8.3 Common SI multiples
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Prefix & Name & Meaning & \\
\hline G & giga & multiply by $10^{9}$ & i.e. $\times 1000000000$ \\
\hline M & mega & multiply by $10^{6}$ & i.e. $\times 1000000$ \\
\hline k & kilo & multiply by $10^{3}$ & i.e. $\times 1000$ \\
\hline m & milli & multiply by $10^{-3}$ & i.e. $\times \frac{1}{10^{3}}=\frac{1}{1000}=0.001$ \\
\hline $\mu$ & micro & multiply by $10^{-6}$ & i.e. $\times \frac{1}{10^{6}}=\frac{1}{1000000}=0.000001$ \\
\hline n & nano & multiply by $10^{-9}$ & i.e. $\times \frac{1}{10^{9}}=\frac{1}{1000000000}=0.000000001$ \\
\hline p & pico & multiply by $10^{-12}$ & $$\begin{array}{r}
\text { i.e. } \times \frac{1}{10^{12}}=\frac{1}{1000000000000}= \\
0.000000000001
\end{array}$$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A time of 150 ns means $150 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~s}$ or $\frac{150}{10^{9}} \mathrm{~s}$, which is 0.000000150 s ,
i.e. 150 nanoseconds is written as 150 ns and is equal to 150 thousand millionths of a second.
A force of 20 kN means $20 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N}$, which is 20000 newtons,
i.e. 20 kilonewtons is written as 20 kN and is equal to 20 thousand newtons.
A charge of $30 \mu \mathrm{C}$ means $30 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$ or $\frac{30}{10^{6}} \mathrm{C}$, which is 0.000030 C ,
i.e. 30 microcoulombs is written as $30 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and is equal to 30 millionths of a coulomb.
A capacitance of 45 pF means $45 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~F}$ or $\frac{45}{10^{12}} \mathrm{~F}$, which is 0.000000000045 F ,
i.e. 45 picofarads is written as 45 pF and is equal to 45 million millionths of a farad.
In engineering it is important to understand what such quantities as $15 \mathrm{GHz}, 40 \mathrm{MV}, 12 \mathrm{mH}, 150 \mathrm{~ns}, 20 \mathrm{kN}$, $30 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and 45 pF mean.

\subsection*{8.4 Standard form}

A number written with one digit to the left of the decimal point and multiplied by 10 raised to some power is said to be written in standard form.

For example, $\quad 43645=4.3645 \times 10^{4}$ in standard form
and
$$0.0534=5.34 \times 10^{-2}$$
in standard form

Problem 1. Express in standard form (a) 38.71 (b) 3746 (c) 0.0124

For a number to be in standard form, it is expressed with only one digit to the left of the decimal point. Thus,
(a) 38.71 must be divided by 10 to achieve one digit to the left of the decimal point and it must also be multiplied by 10 to maintain the equality, i.e.
$38.71=\frac{38.71}{10} \times 10=\mathbf{3 . 8 7 1} \times \mathbf{1 0}$ in standard form
(b) $3746=\frac{3746}{1000} \times 1000=\mathbf{3 . 7 4 6} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{3}}$ in standard form.
(c) $0.0124=0.0124 \times \frac{100}{100}=\frac{1.24}{100}=\mathbf{1 . 2 4} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{-\mathbf{2}}$ in standard form.

Problem 2. Express the following numbers, which are in standard form, as decimal numbers:
(a) $1.725 \times 10^{-2}$
(b) $5.491 \times 10^{4}$
(c) $9.84 \times 10^{0}$
(a) $1.725 \times 10^{-2}=\frac{1.725}{100}=\mathbf{0 . 0 1 7 2 5}$ (i.e. move the decimal point 2 places to the left).
(b) $5.491 \times 10^{4}=5.491 \times 10000=\mathbf{5 4 9 1 0}$ (i.e. move the decimal point 4 places to the right).
(c) $9.84 \times 10^{0}=9.84 \times 1=\mathbf{9 . 8 4}$ (since $10^{0}=1$ ).

Problem 3. Express in standard form, correct to 3 significant figures, (a) $\frac{3}{8}$ (b) $19 \frac{2}{3}$ (c) $741 \frac{9}{16}$
(a) $\frac{3}{8}=0.375$, and expressing it in standard form
$$0.375=\mathbf{3 . 7 5} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{- 1}}$$
(b) $19 \frac{2}{3}=19 . \dot{6}=\mathbf{1 . 9 7} \times \mathbf{1 0}$ in standard form, correct to 3 significant figures.
(c) $741 \frac{9}{16}=741.5625=7.42 \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{2}}$ in standard form, correct to 3 significant figures.

Problem 4. Express the following numbers, given in standard form, as fractions or mixed numbers,
(a) $2.5 \times 10^{-1}$
(b) $6.25 \times 10^{-2}$
(c) $1.354 \times 10^{2}$
(a) $2.5 \times 10^{-1}=\frac{2.5}{10}=\frac{25}{100}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{4}}$
(b) $6.25 \times 10^{-2}=\frac{6.25}{100}=\frac{625}{10000}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1 6}}$
(c) $1.354 \times 10^{2}=135.4=135 \frac{4}{10}=\mathbf{1 3 5} \frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{5}}$

Problem 5. Evaluate (a) $\left(3.75 \times 10^{3}\right)\left(6 \times 10^{4}\right)$ (b) $\frac{3.5 \times 10^{5}}{7 \times 10^{2}}$, expressing the answers in standard form
(a) $\left(3.75 \times 10^{3}\right)\left(6 \times 10^{4}\right)=(3.75 \times 6)\left(10^{3+4}\right)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =22.50 \times 10^{7} \\
& =\mathbf{2 . 2 5} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{8}}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) $\frac{3.5 \times 10^{5}}{7 \times 10^{2}}=\frac{3.5}{7} \times 10^{5-2}=0.5 \times 10^{3}=\mathbf{5} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{2}}$

\subsection*{8.5 Engineering notation}

In engineering, standard form is not as important as engineering notation. Engineering notation is similar to standard form except that the power of 10 is always a multiple of 3 .

For example,$\quad 43645=43.645 \times 10^{3}$
in engineering notation
and
$$0.0534=53.4 \times 10^{-3}$$
in engineering notation
From the list of engineering prefixes on page 55 it is apparent that all prefixes involve powers of 10 that are multiples of 3 .

For example, a force of 43645 N can rewritten as $43.645 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N}$ and from the list of prefixes can then be expressed as 43.645 kN .

Thus,
$$43645 \mathrm{~N} \equiv 43.645 \mathrm{kN}$$

To help further, on your calculator is an 'ENG' button. Enter the number 43645 into your calculator and then press $=$. Now press the ENG button and the answer is $43.645 \times 10^{3}$. We then have to appreciate that $10^{3}$ is the prefix 'kilo', giving $\mathbf{4 3 6 4 5} \mathrm{N} \equiv \mathbf{4 3 . 6 4 5} \mathbf{~ k N}$.
In another example, let a current be 0.0745 A . Enter 0.0745 into your calculator. Press $=$. Now press ENG and the answer is $74.5 \times 10^{-3}$. We then have to appreciate that $10^{-3}$ is the prefix 'milli', giving $0.0745 \mathrm{~A} \equiv \mathbf{7 4 . 5 \mathrm { mA }}$.

Problem 6. Express the following in engineering notation and in prefix form:
(a) 300000 W
(b) 0.000068 H
(a) Enter 300000 into the calculator. Press $=$ Now press ENG and the answer is $300 \times 10^{3}$.

From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{3}$ corresponds to kilo.
Hence, $300000 \mathrm{~W}=\mathbf{3 0 0} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{3}} \mathbf{W}$ in engineering notation $=\mathbf{3 0 0} \mathbf{k W}$ in prefix form.
(b) Enter 0.000068 into the calculator. Press $=$

Now press ENG and the answer is $68 \times 10^{-6}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{-6}$ corresponds to micro.

Hence, $0.000068 \mathrm{H}=\mathbf{6 8} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{-\mathbf{6}} \mathbf{H}$ in engineering notation $=68 \mu \mathrm{H}$ in prefix form.

Problem 7. Express the following in engineering notation and in prefix form:
(a) $42 \times 10^{5} \Omega$
(b) $4.7 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~F}$
(a) Enter $42 \times 10^{5}$ into the calculator. Press $=$ Now press ENG and the answer is $4.2 \times 10^{6}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{6}$ corresponds to mega.

Hence, $42 \times 10^{5} \Omega=\mathbf{4 . 2} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{6}} \Omega$ in engineering notation $=4.2 \mathrm{M} \boldsymbol{\Omega}$ in prefix form.
(b) Enter $47 \div 10^{10}=\frac{47}{10000000000}$ into the calculator. Press $=$

Now press ENG and the answer is $4.7 \times 10^{-9}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{-9}$ corresponds to nano.
Hence, $47 \div 10^{10} \mathrm{~F}=\mathbf{4 . 7} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{-\mathbf{9}} \mathbf{F}$ in engineering notation $=4.7 \mathrm{nF}$ in prefix form.

Problem 8. Rewrite (a) 0.056 mA in $\mu \mathrm{A}$
(b) 16700 kHz as MHz
(a) Enter $0.056 \div 1000$ into the calculator (since milli means $\div 1000$ ). Press $=$
Now press ENG and the answer is $56 \times 10^{-6}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{-6}$ corresponds to micro.
Hence, $0.056 \mathrm{~mA}=\frac{0.056}{1000} \mathrm{~A}=56 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~A}$ $=56 \mu \mathrm{~A}$.
(b) Enter $16700 \times 1000$ into the calculator (since kilo means $\times 1000$ ). Press $=$
Now press ENG and the answer is $16.7 \times 10^{6}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{6}$ corresponds to mega.

Hence, $16700 \mathrm{kHz}=16700 \times 1000 \mathrm{~Hz}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =16.7 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& =\mathbf{1 6 . 7} \mathbf{M H z}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 9. Rewrite (a) $63 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~V}$ in kV
(b) 3100 pF in nF
(a) Enter $63 \times 10^{4}$ into the calculator. Press $=$ Now press ENG and the answer is $630 \times 10^{3}$.

From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{3}$ corresponds to kilo.
Hence, $63 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~V}=630 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~V}=\mathbf{6 3 0} \mathbf{k V}$.
(b) Enter $3100 \times 10^{-12}$ into the calculator. Press $=$

Now press ENG and the answer is $3.1 \times 10^{-9}$.
From the table of prefixes on page $55,10^{-9}$ corresponds to nano.
Hence, $3100 \mathrm{pF}=31 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~F}=3.1 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~F}$
$$=3.1 \mathrm{nF}$$

Problem 10. Rewrite (a) 14700 mm in metres (b) 276 cm in metres (c) 3.375 kg in grams
(a) $1 \mathrm{~m}=1000 \mathrm{~mm}$, hence
$1 \mathrm{~mm}=\frac{1}{1000}=\frac{1}{10^{3}}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}$.
Hence, $14700 \mathrm{~mm}=14700 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{1 4 . 7} \mathbf{m}$.
(b) $1 \mathrm{~m}=100 \mathrm{~cm}$, hence $1 \mathrm{~cm}=\frac{1}{100}=\frac{1}{10^{2}}=10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$.

Hence, $276 \mathrm{~cm}=276 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{2 . 7 6} \mathbf{m}$.
(c) $1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000 \mathrm{~g}=10^{3} \mathrm{~g}$

\section*{Chapter 9}

\subsection*{9.1 Introduction}

We are already familiar with evaluating formulae using a calculator from Chapter 4.
For example, if the length of a football pitch is $L$ and its width is $b$, then the formula for the area $A$ is given by
$$A=L \times b$$

This is an algebraic equation.
If $L=120 \mathrm{~m}$ and $b=60 \mathrm{~m}$, then the area
$A=120 \times 60=7200 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
The total resistance, $R_{T}$, of resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ connected in series is given by
$$R_{T}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}$$

This is an algebraic equation.
If $R_{1}=6.3 \mathrm{k} \Omega, R_{2}=2.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $R_{3}=8.5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, then
$$R_{T}=6.3+2.4+8.5=17.2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

The temperature in Fahrenheit, $F$, is given by
$$F=\frac{9}{5} \mathrm{C}+32$$
where $C$ is the temperature in Celsius. This is an algebraic equation.
$$\text { If } \begin{aligned}
C=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \text {, then } \begin{aligned}
F & =\frac{9}{5} \times 100+32 \\
& =180+32=212^{\circ} \mathrm{F} .
\end{aligned} . . \begin{array}{l}
\end{array}{ }^{\circ} \times 1 .
\end{aligned}$$

If you can cope with evaluating formulae then you will be able to cope with algebra.

\subsection*{9.2 Basic operations}

Algebra merely uses letters to represent numbers.
If, say, $a, b, c$ and $d$ represent any four numbers then in algebra:

\section*{Basic algebra}
(a) $a+a+a+\boldsymbol{a}=4 \boldsymbol{a}$. For example, if $a=2$, then $2+2+2+2=4 \times 2=8$.
(b) $\mathbf{5 b}$ means $5 \times \boldsymbol{b}$. For example, if $b=4$, then $5 b=5 \times 4=20$.
(c) $2 a+3 b+a-2 b=2 a+a+3 b-2 b=3 a+b$

Only similar terms can be combined in algebra. The $2 a$ and the $+a$ can be combined to give $3 a$ and the $3 b$ and $-2 b$ can be combined to give $1 b$, which is written as $b$.

In addition, with terms separated by + and - signs, the order in which they are written does not matter. In this example, $2 a+3 b+a-2 b$ is the same as $2 a+a+3 b-2 b$, which is the same as $3 b+a+$ $2 a-2 b$, and so on. (Note that the first term, i.e. $2 a$, means $+2 a$.)
(d) $4 a b c d=4 \times a \times b \times c \times d$

For example, if $a=3, b=-2, c=1$ and $d=-5$, then $4 a b c d=4 \times 3 \times-2 \times 1 \times-5=120$. (Note that $-\times-=+$ )
(e) $(\boldsymbol{a})(\boldsymbol{c})(\boldsymbol{d})$ means $\boldsymbol{a} \times \boldsymbol{c} \times \boldsymbol{d}$

Brackets are often used instead of multiplication signs. For example, (2)(5)(3) means $2 \times 5 \times 3=$ 30.
(f) $a b=b a$

If $a=2$ and $b=3$ then $2 \times 3$ is exactly the same as $3 \times 2$, i.e. 6 .
(g) $\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}=\boldsymbol{b} \times \boldsymbol{b}$. For example, if $b=3$, then $3^{2}=3 \times 3=9$.
(h) $\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{3}}=\boldsymbol{a} \times \boldsymbol{a} \times \boldsymbol{a}$ For example, if $a=2$, then $2^{3}=2 \times 2 \times 2=8$.

Here are some worked examples to help get a feel for basic operations in this introduction to algebra.

\subsection*{9.2.1 Addition and subtraction}

Problem 1. Find the sum of $4 x, 3 x,-2 x$ and $-x$

& \quad=2 x-y+7 z

Note that the order can be changed when terms are separated by + and - signs. Only similar terms can be combined.

$$\begin{aligned}
5 p q^{2} r^{3} & =5 \times p \times q^{2} \times r^{3} \\
& =5 \times 2 \times\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{2} \times\left(2 \frac{1}{2}\right)^{3}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{array}{lr}
=5 \times 2 \times\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{2} \times\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{3} & \text { since } 2 \frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{2} \\
=\frac{5}{1} \times \frac{2}{1} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{5}{2} \\
=\frac{1}{1} \times \frac{1}{1} \times \frac{1}{1} \times \frac{1}{1} \times \frac{1}{1} \times \frac{5}{1} \times \frac{5}{1} \quad \text { by cancelling } \\
=5 \times 5 \\
=25 &
\end{array}$$

Problem 10. Multiply $2 a+3 b$ by $a+b$

Each term in the first expression is multiplied by $a$, then each term in the first expression is multiplied by $b$ and the two results are added. The usual layout is shown below.

Multiplying by $a$ gives
$$\begin{gathered}
2 a+3 b \\
\frac{a+b}{2 a^{2}+3 a b}
\end{gathered}$$

Multiplying by $b$ gives
Adding gives
$$\frac{2 a b+3 b^{2}}{\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{2}}+\mathbf{5} \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}+\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}}$$

Thus, $(2 a+3 b)(a+b)=2 a^{2}+5 a b+3 b^{2}$

Problem 11. Multiply $3 x-2 y^{2}+4 x y$ by $2 x-5 y$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Multiplying } \\
\text { by } 2 x \rightarrow
\end{aligned} \begin{aligned}
& 3 x-2 y^{2}+4 x y \\
& 2 x-5 y
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying by $-5 y \rightarrow \quad-20 x y^{2} \quad-15 x y+10 y^{3}$
Adding gives $\quad 6 x^{2}-24 x y^{2}+8 x^{2} y-15 x y+10 y^{3}$
Thus, $\left(3 x-2 y^{2}+4 x y\right)(2 x-5 y)$
$$=6 x^{2}-24 x y^{2}+8 x^{2} y-15 x y+10 y^{3}$$

Problem 12. Simplify $2 x \div 8 x y$
$$\begin{array}{rlr}
2 x \div 8 x y \text { means } & \frac{2 x}{8 x y} \\
\frac{2 x}{8 x y} & =\frac{2 \times x}{8 \times x \times y} & \\
& =\frac{1 \times 1}{4 \times 1 \times y} & \text { by cancelling } \\
& =\frac{1}{4 y} &
\end{array}$$

Problem 13. Simplify $\frac{9 a^{2} b c}{3 a c}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{9 a^{2} b c}{3 a c} & =\frac{9 \times a \times a \times b \times c}{3 \times a \times c} \\
& =3 \times a \times b \\
& =\mathbf{3 a b}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 14. Divide $2 x^{2}+x-3$ by $x-1$}
(i) $2 x^{2}+x-3$ is called the dividend and $x-1$ the divisor. The usual layout is shown below with the dividend and divisor both arranged in descending powers of the symbols.
$$\begin{array}{r}
2 x+3 \\
x - 1 \longdiv { 2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 } \\
\frac{2 x^{2}-2 x}{3 x-3} \\
\frac{3 x-3}{?}
\end{array}$$
(ii) Dividing the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor, i.e. $\frac{2 x^{2}}{x}$ gives $2 x$, which is put above the first term of the dividend as shown.
(iii) The divisor is then multiplied by $2 x$, i.e. $2 x(x-1)=2 x^{2}-2 x$, which is placed under the dividend as shown. Subtracting gives $3 x-3$.
(iv) The process is then repeated, i.e. the first term of the divisor, $x$, is divided into $3 x$, giving +3 , which is placed above the dividend as shown.
(v) Then $3(x-1)=3 x-3$, which is placed under the $3 x-3$. The remainder, on subtraction, is zero, which completes the process.

Thus, $\left(2 x^{2}+x-3\right) \div(x-1)=(2 x+3)$.
(A check can be made on this answer by multiplying $(2 x+3)$ by $(x-1)$, which equals $2 x^{2}+x-3$.)

Problem 15. Simplify $\frac{x^{3}+y^{3}}{x+y}$
(i) (iv) (vii)
$$\begin{array}{r}
x^{2}-x y+y^{2} \\
\frac{x^{3}+x^{2} y}{-x^{2} y+y^{3}} \\
\frac{-x^{2} y-x y^{2}}{x^{3}} \\
\frac{x y^{2}+y^{3}}{} \\
\frac{x y^{2}+y^{3}}{\cdot}
\end{array}$$
(i) $x$ into $x^{3}$ goes $x^{2}$. Put $x^{2}$ above $x^{3}$.
(ii) $x^{2}(x+y)=x^{3}+x^{2} y$
(iii) Subtract.
(iv) $x$ into $-x^{2} y$ goes $-x y$. Put $-x y$ above the dividend.
(v) $-x y(x+y)=-x^{2} y-x y^{2}$
(vi) Subtract.
(vii) $x$ into $x y^{2}$ goes $y^{2}$. Put $y^{2}$ above the dividend.
(viii) $y^{2}(x+y)=x y^{2}+y^{3}$
(ix) Subtract.

Thus, $\frac{x^{3}+y^{3}}{x+y}=x^{2}-x y+y^{2}$.
The zeros shown in the dividend are not normally shown, but are included to clarify the subtraction process and to keep similar terms in their respective columns.

Problem 16. Divide $4 a^{3}-6 a^{2} b+5 b^{3}$ by $2 a-b$
$$\begin{array}{r}
2 a a^{2}-2 a b-b^{2} \\
2 a-b \stackrel{4 a^{3}-6 a^{2} b+5 b^{3}}{\frac{4 a^{3}-2 a^{2} b}{-4 a^{2} b}+5 b^{3}} \\
\frac{-4 a^{2} b+2 a b^{2}}{-2 a b^{2}+5 b^{3}} \\
\frac{-2 a b^{2}+b^{3}}{4 b^{3}}
\end{array}$$

Thus, $\frac{4 a^{3}-6 a^{2} b+5 b^{3}}{2 a-b}=2 a^{2}-2 a b-b^{2}$, remain$\operatorname{der} 4 b^{3}$.

Alternatively, the answer may be expressed as
$$\frac{4 a^{3}-6 a^{2} b+5 b^{3}}{2 a-b}=2 a^{2}-2 a b-b^{2}+\frac{4 b^{3}}{2 a-b}$$

\subsection*{9.3 Laws of indices}

The laws of indices with numbers were covered in Chapter 7; the laws of indices in algebraic terms are as follows:
(1) $a^{m} \times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$

For example, $a^{3} \times a^{4}=a^{3+4}=a^{7}$
(2) $\frac{\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{m}}}{\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{n}}}=\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{m}-\boldsymbol{n}} \quad$ For example, $\frac{c^{5}}{c^{2}}=c^{5-2}=c^{3}$
(3) $\quad\left(\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{m}}\right)^{\boldsymbol{n}}=\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{n}} \quad$ For example, $\left(d^{2}\right)^{3}=d^{2 \times 3}=d^{6}$
(4) $a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{m}}} \quad$ For example, $x^{\frac{4}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{x^{4}}$
(5) $\quad \boldsymbol{a}^{-\boldsymbol{n}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{n}}} \quad$ For example, $3^{-2}=\frac{1}{3^{2}}=\frac{1}{9}$
(6) $\quad \boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{0}}=\mathbf{1} \quad$ For example, $17^{0}=1$

Here are some worked examples to demonstrate these laws of indices.

Problem 17. Simplify $a^{2} b^{3} c \times a b^{2} c^{5}$
$$\begin{aligned}
a^{2} b^{3} c \times a b^{2} c^{5} & =a^{2} \times b^{3} \times c \times a \times b^{2} \times c^{5} \\
& =a^{2} \times b^{3} \times c^{1} \times a^{1} \times b^{2} \times c^{5}
\end{aligned}$$

Grouping together like terms gives
$$a^{2} \times a^{1} \times b^{3} \times b^{2} \times c^{1} \times c^{5}$$

Using law (1) of indices gives
$$a^{2+1} \times b^{3+2} \times c^{1+5}=a^{3} \times b^{5} \times c^{6}$$
i.e.
$$a^{2} b^{3} c \times a b^{2} c^{5}=a^{3} b^{5} c^{6}$$

\section*{Problem 18. Simplify $a^{\frac{1}{3}} b^{\frac{3}{2}} c^{-2} \times a^{\frac{1}{6}} b^{\frac{1}{2}} c$}

Using law (1) of indices,
$$\begin{aligned}
a^{\frac{1}{3}} b^{\frac{3}{2}} c^{-2} \times a^{\frac{1}{6}} b^{\frac{1}{2}} c & =a^{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}} \times b^{\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2}} \times c^{-2+1} \\
& =a^{\frac{1}{2}} \boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{c}^{-\mathbf{1}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 19. Simplify $\frac{x^{5} y^{2} z}{x^{2} y z^{3}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{x^{5} y^{2} z}{x^{2} y z^{3}} & =\frac{x^{5} \times y^{2} \times z}{x^{2} \times y \times z^{3}} \\
& =\frac{x^{5}}{x^{2}} \times \frac{y^{2}}{y^{1}} \times \frac{z}{z^{3}} \\
& =x^{5-2} \times y^{2-1} \times z^{1-3} \quad \text { by law (2) of indices } \\
& =x^{3} \times y^{1} \times z^{-2} \\
& =x^{3} y z^{-2} \text { or } \frac{x^{3} y}{z^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 20. Simplify $\frac{a^{3} b^{2} c^{4}}{a b c^{-2}}$ and evaluate when $a=3, b=\frac{1}{4}$ and $c=2$

Using law (2) of indices,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{a^{3}}{a}=a^{3-1}=a^{2}, \frac{b^{2}}{b}=b^{2-1} & =b \text { and } \\
& \frac{c^{4}}{c^{-2}}=c^{4--2}=c^{6}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, $\frac{a^{3} b^{2} c^{4}}{a b c^{-2}}=\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}^{\mathbf{6}}$
When $a=3, b=\frac{1}{4}$ and $c=2$,
$a^{2} b c^{6}=(3)^{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(2)^{6}=(9)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(64)=\mathbf{1 4 4}$
Problem 21. Simplify $\left(p^{3}\right)^{2}\left(q^{2}\right)^{4}$
Using law (3) of indices gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(p^{3}\right)^{2}\left(q^{2}\right)^{4} & =p^{3 \times 2} \times q^{2 \times 4} \\
& =\boldsymbol{p}^{6} \boldsymbol{q}^{\mathbf{8}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 22. Simplify $\frac{\left(m n^{2}\right)^{3}}{\left(m^{1 / 2} n^{1 / 4}\right)^{4}}$

The brackets indicate that each letter in the bracket must be raised to the power outside. Using law (3) of indices gives
$$\frac{\left(m n^{2}\right)^{3}}{\left(m^{1 / 2} n^{1 / 4}\right)^{4}}=\frac{m^{1 \times 3} n^{2 \times 3}}{m^{(1 / 2) \times 4} n^{(1 / 4) \times 4}}=\frac{m^{3} n^{6}}{m^{2} n^{1}}$$

Using law (2) of indices gives
$$\frac{m^{3} n^{6}}{m^{2} n^{1}}=m^{3-2} n^{6-1}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{n}^{5}$$

Problem 23. Simplify $\left(a^{3} b\right)\left(a^{-4} b^{-2}\right)$, expressing the answer with positive indices only

Using law (1) of indices gives $a^{3+-4} b^{1+-2}=a^{-1} b^{-1}$
Using law (5) of indices gives $a^{-1} b^{-1}=\frac{1}{a^{+1} b^{+1}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}}$

20. Simplify $\frac{a^{5} b c^{3}}{a^{2} b^{3} c^{2}}$ and evaluate when $a=\frac{3}{2}, b=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{2}{3}$

Here are some further worked examples on the laws of indices

Problem 25. Simplify $\frac{p^{1 / 2} q^{2} r^{2 / 3}}{p^{1 / 4} q^{1 / 2} r^{1 / 6}}$ and evaluate when $p=16, q=9$ and $r=4$, taking positive roots only

Using law (2) of indices gives $p^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}} q^{2-\frac{1}{2}} r^{\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{6}}$
$$p^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}} q^{2-\frac{1}{2}} r^{\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{6}}=p^{\frac{1}{4}} q^{\frac{3}{2}} r^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

When $p=16, q=9$ and $r=4$,
$p^{\frac{1}{4}} q^{\frac{3}{2}} r^{\frac{1}{2}}=16^{\frac{1}{4}} 9^{\frac{3}{2}} 4^{\frac{1}{2}}$
$=(\sqrt[4]{16})\left(\sqrt{9^{3}}\right)(\sqrt{4})$ from law (4) of indices
$=(2)\left(3^{3}\right)(2)=\mathbf{1 0 8}$

Problem 26. Simplify $\frac{x^{2} y^{3}+x y^{2}}{x y}$
Algebraic expressions of the form $\frac{a+b}{c}$ can be split into $\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}$. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{x^{2} y^{3}+x y^{2}}{x y}=\frac{x^{2} y^{3}}{x y}+\frac{x y^{2}}{x y} & =x^{2-1} y^{3-1}+x^{1-1} y^{2-1} \\
& =\boldsymbol{x} y^{2}+\boldsymbol{y}
\end{aligned}$$
(since $x^{0}=1$, from law (6) of indices).

Problem 27. Simplify $\frac{x^{2} y}{x y^{2}-x y}$

The highest common factor (HCF) of each of the three terms comprising the numerator and denominator is $x y$. Dividing each term by $x y$ gives
$$\frac{x^{2} y}{x y^{2}-x y}=\frac{\frac{x^{2} y}{x y}}{\frac{x y^{2}}{x y}-\frac{x y}{x y}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\boldsymbol{y}-\mathbf{1}}$$

Problem 28. Simplify $\frac{a^{2} b}{a b^{2}-a^{1 / 2} b^{3}}$

The HCF of each of the three terms is $a^{1 / 2} b$. Dividing each term by $a^{1 / 2} b$ gives
$$\frac{a^{2} b}{a b^{2}-a^{1 / 2} b^{3}}=\frac{\frac{a^{2} b}{a^{1 / 2} b}}{\frac{a b^{2}}{a^{1 / 2} b}-\frac{a^{1 / 2} b^{3}}{a^{1 / 2} b}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{3} / \mathbf{2}}}{\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{1 / 2}} \boldsymbol{b}-\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}}$$

Problem 29. Simplify $\left(a^{3} \sqrt{b} \sqrt{c^{5}}\right)\left(\sqrt{a} \sqrt[3]{b^{2}} c^{3}\right)$ and evaluate when $a=\frac{1}{4}, b=6$ and $c=1$

Using law (4) of indices, the expression can be written as
$$\left(a^{3} \sqrt{b} \sqrt{c^{5}}\right)\left(\sqrt{a} \sqrt[3]{b^{2}} c^{3}\right)=\left(a^{3} b^{\frac{1}{2}} c^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\left(a^{\frac{1}{2}} b^{\frac{2}{3}} c^{3}\right)$$

Using law (1) of indices gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(a^{3} b^{\frac{1}{2}} c^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)\left(a^{\frac{1}{2}} b^{\frac{2}{3}} c^{3}\right) & =a^{3+\frac{1}{2}} b^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}} c^{\frac{5}{2}+3} \\
& =a^{\frac{7}{2}} b^{\frac{7}{6}} c^{\frac{11}{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

It is usual to express the answer in the same form as the question. Hence,
$$a^{\frac{7}{2}} b^{\frac{7}{6}} c^{\frac{11}{2}}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{7}}} \sqrt[6]{\boldsymbol{b}^{7}} \sqrt{\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathbf{1 1}}}$$

When $a=\frac{1}{4}, b=64$ and $c=1$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{a^{7}} \sqrt[6]{b^{7}} \sqrt{c^{11}} & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{7}}\left(\sqrt[6]{64^{7}}\right)\left(\sqrt{1^{11}}\right) \\
& =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{7}(2)^{7}(1)=\mathbf{1}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 30. Simplify $\frac{\left(x^{2} y^{1 / 2}\right)\left(\sqrt{x} \sqrt[3]{y^{2}}\right)}{\left(x^{5} y^{3}\right)^{1 / 2}}$

Using laws (3) and (4) of indices gives
$$\frac{\left(x^{2} y^{1 / 2}\right)\left(\sqrt{x} \sqrt[3]{y^{2}}\right)}{\left(x^{5} y^{3}\right)^{1 / 2}}=\frac{\left(x^{2} y^{1 / 2}\right)\left(x^{1 / 2} y^{2 / 3}\right)}{x^{5 / 2} y^{3 / 2}}$$

Using laws (1) and (2) of indices gives
$$x^{2+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{5}{2}} y^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}-\frac{3}{2}}=x^{0} y^{-\frac{1}{3}}=y^{-\frac{1}{3}} \text { or } \frac{1}{y^{1 / 3}} \text { or } \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{y}}$$
from laws (5) and (6) of indices.

\section*{Further algebra}

\subsection*{10.1 Introduction}

In this chapter, the use of brackets and factorization with algebra is explained, together with further practice with the laws of precedence. Understanding of these topics is often necessary when solving and transposing equations.

\subsection*{10.2 Brackets}

With algebra
(a) $2(a+b)=2 a+2 b$
(b) $(a+b)(c+d)=a(c+d)+b(c+d)$
$$=a c+a d+b c+b d$$

Here are some worked examples to help understanding of brackets with algebra.

Problem 1. Determine $2 b(a-5 b)$
$$\begin{aligned}
2 b(a-5 b) & =2 b \times a+2 b \times-5 b \\
& =2 b a-10 b^{2} \\
& =\mathbf{2 a b}-\mathbf{1 0} b^{\mathbf{2}} \quad \begin{array}{l}
\text { (note that } 2 b a \text { is the } \\
\\
\\
\quad \text { same as } 2 a b)
\end{array}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 2. Determine $(3 x+4 y)(x-y)$
$$\begin{aligned}
(3 x+4 y)(x-y) & =3 x(x-y)+4 y(x-y) \\
& =3 x^{2}-3 x y+4 y x-4 y^{2} \\
& =3 x^{2}-3 x y+4 x y-4 y^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
(note that $4 y x$ is the same as $4 x y$ )
$$=3 x^{2}+x y-4 y^{2}$$

Problem 3. Simplify $3(2 x-3 y)-(3 x-y)$
$3(2 x-3 y)-(3 x-y)=3 \times 2 x-3 \times 3 y-3 x--y$
(Note that $-(3 x-y)=-1(3 x-y)$ and the
-1 multiplies both terms in the bracket)
$$=6 x-9 y-3 x+y$$
(Note: $-\times-=+$ )
$$\begin{aligned}
& =6 x-3 x+y-9 y \\
& =3 x-8 y
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 4. Remove the brackets and simplify the expression $(a-2 b)+5(b-c)-3(c+2 d)$
$$\begin{aligned}
(a & -2 b)+5(b-c)-3(c+2 d) \\
& =a-2 b+5 \times b+5 \times-c-3 \times c-3 \times 2 d \\
& =a-2 b+5 b-5 c-3 c-6 d \\
& =a+3 b-8 c-6 d
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. Simplify $(p+q)(p-q)$
$$\begin{aligned}
(p+q)(p-q) & =p(p-q)+q(p-q) \\
& =p^{2}-p q+q p-q^{2} \\
& =p^{2}-q^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 6. Simplify $(2 x-3 y)^{2}$
$$\begin{aligned}
(2 x-3 y)^{2}= & (2 x-3 y)(2 x-3 y) \\
= & 2 x(2 x-3 y)-3 y(2 x-3 y) \\
= & 2 x \times 2 x+2 x \times-3 y-3 y \times 2 x \\
& =4 x^{2}-6 x y-6 x y+9 y^{2} \\
& \quad-3 y \times-3 y \\
& \quad \text { Note: }+\times-=- \text { and }-\times-=+) \\
= & 4 x^{2}-\mathbf{1 2 x y}+9 y^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. Remove the brackets from the expression and simplify $2\left[x^{2}-3 x(y+x)+4 x y\right]$
$2\left[x^{2}-3 x(y+x)+4 x y\right]=2\left[x^{2}-3 x y-3 x^{2}+4 x y\right]$
(Whenever more than one type of brackets is involved, always start with the inner brackets)
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2\left[-2 x^{2}+x y\right] \\
& =-4 x^{2}+2 x y \\
& =\mathbf{2 x y} \boldsymbol{- 4} \boldsymbol{x}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 8. Remove the brackets and simplify the expression $2 a-[3\{2(4 a-b)-5(a+2 b)\}+4 a]$
(i) Removing the innermost brackets gives
$$2 a-[3\{8 a-2 b-5 a-10 b\}+4 a]$$
(ii) Collecting together similar terms gives
$$2 a-[3\{3 a-12 b\}+4 a]$$
(iii) Removing the 'curly' brackets gives
$$2 a-[9 a-36 b+4 a]$$
(iv) Collecting together similar terms gives
$$2 a-[13 a-36 b]$$
(v) Removing the outer brackets gives
$$2 a-13 a+36 b$$
(vi) i.e. $-11 a+36 b$ or $36 b-11 a$

\subsection*{10.3 Factorization}

The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8 because 8 divides by $1,2,4$ and 8 .
The factors of 24 are $1,2,3,4,6,8,12$ and 24 because 24 divides by $1,2,3,4,6,8,12$ and 24 .
The common factors of 8 and 24 are 1,2,4 and 8 since $1,2,4$ and 8 are factors of both 8 and 24 .
The highest common factor (HCF) is the largest number that divides into two or more terms.
Hence, the HCF of 8 and 24 is 8 , as explained in Chapter 1.
When two or more terms in an algebraic expression contain a common factor, then this factor can be shown outside of a bracket. For example,
$$d f+d g=d(f+g)$$
which is just the reverse of
$$d(f+g)=d f+d g$$

This process is called factorization.
Here are some worked examples to help understanding of factorizing in algebra.

Problem 9. Factorize $a b-5 a c$
$a$ is common to both terms $a b$ and $-5 a c . a$ is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes inside the bracket?
(i) What multiplies $a$ to make $a b$ ? Answer: $b$
(ii) What multiplies $a$ to make $-5 a c$ ? Answer: $-5 c$

Hence, $b-5 c$ appears in the bracket. Thus,
$$a b-5 a c=a(b-5 c)$$

Problem 10. Factorize $2 x^{2}+14 x y^{3}$

For the numbers 2 and 14, the highest common factor (HCF) is 2 (i.e. 2 is the largest number that divides into both 2 and 14).
For the $x$ terms, $x^{2}$ and $x$, the HCF is $x$.
Thus, the HCF of $2 x^{2}$ and $14 x y^{3}$ is $2 x$.
$2 x$ is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes inside the bracket?
(i) What multiplies $2 x$ to make $2 x^{2}$ ? Answer: $x$
(ii) What multiplies $2 x$ to make $14 x y^{3}$ ? Answer: $7 y^{3}$

Hence $x+7 y^{3}$ appears inside the bracket. Thus,
$$2 x^{2}+14 x y^{3}=2 x\left(x+7 y^{3}\right)$$

Problem 11. Factorize $3 x^{3} y-12 x y^{2}+15 x y$

For the numbers 3, 12 and 15, the highest common factor is 3 (i.e. 3 is the largest number that divides into 3,12 and 15).
For the $x$ terms, $x^{3}, x$ and $x$, the HCF is $x$.
For the $y$ terms, $y, y^{2}$ and $y$, the HCF is $y$.
Thus, the HCF of $3 x^{3} y$ and $12 x y^{2}$ and $15 x y$ is $3 x y$. $3 x y$ is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes inside the bracket?
(i) What multiplies $3 x y$ to make $3 x^{3} y$ ? Answer: $x^{2}$
(ii) What multiplies $3 x y$ to make $-12 x y^{2}$ ? Answer: $-4 y$
(iii) What multiplies $3 x y$ to make $15 x y$ ? Answer: 5

Hence, $x^{2}-4 y+5$ appears inside the bracket. Thus,
$$3 x^{3} y-12 x y^{2}+15 x y=3 x y\left(x^{2}-4 y+5\right)$$

Problem 12. Factorize $25 a^{2} b^{5}-5 a^{3} b^{2}$

For the numbers 25 and 5, the highest common factor is 5 (i.e. 5 is the largest number that divides into 25 and 5).
For the $a$ terms, $a^{2}$ and $a^{3}$, the HCF is $a^{2}$.
For the $b$ terms, $b^{5}$ and $b^{2}$, the HCF is $b^{2}$.

Thus, the HCF of $25 a^{2} b^{5}$ and $5 a^{3} b^{2}$ is $5 a^{2} b^{2}$. $5 a^{2} b^{2}$ is therefore taken outside of the bracket. What goes inside the bracket?
(i) What multiplies $5 a^{2} b^{2}$ to make $25 a^{2} b^{5}$ ? Answer: $5 b^{3}$
(ii) What multiplies $5 a^{2} b^{2}$ to make $-5 a^{3} b^{2}$ ? Answer: $-a$

Hence, $5 b^{3}-a$ appears in the bracket. Thus,
$$25 a^{2} b^{5}-5 a^{3} b^{2}=5 a^{2} b^{2}\left(5 b^{3}-a\right)$$

Problem 13. Factorize $a x-a y+b x-b y$

The first two terms have a common factor of $a$ and the last two terms a common factor of $b$. Thus,
$$a x-a y+b x-b y=a(x-y)+b(x-y)$$

The two newly formed terms have a common factor of ( $x-y$ ). Thus,
$$a(x-y)+b(x-y)=(x-y)(a+b)$$

\section*{Problem 14. Factorize $2 a x-3 a y+2 b x-3 b y$}
$a$ is a common factor of the first two terms and $b$ a common factor of the last two terms. Thus,
$$2 a x-3 a y+2 b x-3 b y=a(2 x-3 y)+b(2 x-3 y)$$
$(2 x-3 y)$ is now a common factor. Thus,
$$a(2 x-3 y)+b(2 x-3 y)=(2 x-3 y)(a+b)$$

Alternatively, $2 x$ is a common factor of the original first and third terms and $-3 y$ is a common factor of the second and fourth terms. Thus,
$$2 a x-3 a y+2 b x-3 b y=2 x(a+b)-3 y(a+b)$$
$(a+b)$ is now a common factor. Thus,
$$2 x(a+b)-3 y(a+b)=(a+b)(2 x-3 y)$$
as before

\section*{Problem 15. Factorize $x^{3}+3 x^{2}-x-3$} $x^{2}$ is a common factor of the first two terms. Thus,
$$x^{3}+3 x^{2}-x-3=x^{2}(x+3)-x-3$$
-1 is a common factor of the last two terms. Thus,
$$x^{2}(x+3)-x-3=x^{2}(x+3)-1(x+3)$$
$(x+3)$ is now a common factor. Thus,
$$x^{2}(x+3)-1(x-3)=(x+3)\left(x^{2}-\mathbf{1}\right)$$

\section*{Solving simple equations}

\subsection*{11.1 Introduction}
$3 x-4$ is an example of an algebraic expression.
$3 x-4=2$ is an example of an algebraic equation (i.e. it contains an ' $=$ ' sign).
An equation is simply a statement that two expressions are equal.
Hence, $A=\pi r^{2}$ (where A is the area of a circle of radius $r$ )
$F=\frac{9}{5} C+32$ (which relates Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures)
and
$y=3 x+2$ (which is the equation of a straight line graph)
are all examples of equations.

\subsection*{11.2 Solving equations}

To 'solve an equation' means 'to find the value of the unknown'. For example, solving $3 x-4=2$ means that the value of $x$ is required.
In this example, $x=2$. How did we arrive at $x=2$ ? This is the purpose of this chapter - to show how to solve such equations.
Many equations occur in engineering and it is essential that we can solve them when needed.
Here are some examples to demonstrate how simple equations are solved.

Problem 1. Solve the equation $4 x=20$

Dividing each side of the equation by 4 gives
$$\frac{4 x}{4}=\frac{20}{4}$$
i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{5}$ by cancelling, which is the solution to the equation $4 x=20$.

The same operation must be applied to both sides of an equation so that the equality is maintained.
We can do anything we like to an equation, as long as we do the same to both sides. This is, in fact, the only rule to remember when solving simple equations (and also when transposing formulae, which we do in Chapter 12).

Problem 2. Solve the equation $\frac{2 x}{5}=6$
Multiplying both sides by 5 gives $\quad 5\left(\frac{2 x}{5}\right)=5(6)$
Cancelling and removing brackets gives $2 x=30$
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2 x}{2} & =\frac{30}{2} \\
x & =15
\end{aligned}$$

Cancelling gives
which is the solution of the equation $\frac{2 x}{5}=6$.
Problem 3. Solve the equation $a-5=8$
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
a-5+5 & =8+5 \\
a & =8+5 \\
\boldsymbol{a} & =\mathbf{1 3}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
which is the solution of the equation $a-5=8$.
Note that adding 5 to both sides of the above equation results in the -5 moving from the LHS to the RHS, but the sign is changed to + .

Problem 4. Solve the equation $x+3=7$
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives $x+3-3=7-3$ i.e. $x=7-3$
i.e.
$x=4$
which is the solution of the equation $x+3=7$.

Note that subtracting 3 from both sides of the above equation results in the +3 moving from the LHS to the RHS, but the sign is changed to - . So, we can move straight from $x+3=7$ to $x=7-3$.
Thus, a term can be moved from one side of an equation to the other as long as a change in sign is made.

Problem 5. Solve the equation $6 x+1=2 x+9$
In such equations the terms containing $x$ are grouped on one side of the equation and the remaining terms grouped on the other side of the equation. As in Problems 3 and 4, changing from one side of an equation to the other must be accompanied by a change of sign.
\begin{tabular}{rlrl} 
& Since & $6 x+1$ & $=2 x+9$ \\
& then & $6 x-2 x$ & $=9-1$ \\
& i.e. & $4 x$ & $=8$ \\
& Dividing both sides by 4 gives $\frac{4 x}{4}$ & $=\frac{8}{4}$ \\
& Cancelling gives & $\boldsymbol{x}$ & $=\mathbf{2}$
\end{tabular}
which is the solution of the equation $6 x+1=2 x+9$. In the above examples, the solutions can be checked. Thus, in Problem 5, where $6 x+1=2 x+9$, if $x=2$, then
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { LHS of equation }=6(2)+1=13 \\
& \text { RHS of equation }=2(2)+9=13
\end{aligned}$$

Since the left hand side (LHS) equals the right hand side (RHS) then $x=2$ must be the correct solution of the equation.
When solving simple equations, always check your answers by substituting your solution back into the original equation.

Problem 6. Solve the equation $4-3 p=2 p-11$

In order to keep the $p$ term positive the terms in $p$ are moved to the RHS and the constant terms to the LHS.
Similar to Problem 5, if $4-3 p=2 p-11$
then
$$4+11=2 p+3 p$$
i.e.
$$15=5 p$$

Dividing both sides by 5 gives $\frac{15}{5}=\frac{5 p}{5}$
Cancelling gives $\quad \mathbf{3}=\boldsymbol{p}$ or $\boldsymbol{p}=\mathbf{3}$
which is the solution of the equation $4-3 p=2 p-11$.

By substituting $p=3$ into the original equation, the solution may be checked.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{LHS}=4-3(3)=4-9=-5 \\
& \mathrm{RHS}=2(3)-11=6-11=-5
\end{aligned}$$

Since LHS $=$ RHS, the solution $p=3$ must be correct. If, in this example, the unknown quantities had been grouped initially on the LHS instead of the RHS, then $-3 p-2 p=-11-4$
i.e.
$$-5 p=-15$$
from which,
$$\frac{-5 p}{-5}=\frac{-15}{-5}$$
and
$$p=3$$
as before.
It is often easier, however, to work with positive values where possible.

Problem 7. Solve the equation $3(x-2)=9$

Removing the bracket gives $3 x-6=9$
Rearranging gives $\quad 3 x=9+6$
i.e.
$$3 x=15$$

Dividing both sides by 3 gives $\quad \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{5}$
which is the solution of the equation $3(x-2)=9$.
The equation may be checked by substituting $x=5$ back into the original equation.

Problem 8. Solve the equation
$$4(2 r-3)-2(r-4)=3(r-3)-1$$

Removing brackets gives
$$8 r-12-2 r+8=3 r-9-1$$

Rearranging gives $8 r-2 r-3 r=-9-1+12-8$
i.e.
$$3 r=-6$$

Dividing both sides by 3 gives $r=\frac{-6}{3}=\mathbf{- 2}$
which is the solution of the equation
$4(2 r-3)-2(r-4)=3(r-3)-1$.
The solution may be checked by substituting $r=-2$ back into the original equation.
LHS $=4(-4-3)-2(-2-4)=-28+12=-16$
RHS $=3(-2-3)-1=-15-1=-16$
Since LHS $=$ RHS then $r=-2$ is the correct solution.

17. $11+3(r-7)=16-(r+2)$
18. $8+4(x-1)-5(x-3)=2(5-2 x)$

Here are some further worked examples on solving simple equations.

Problem 9. Solve the equation $\frac{4}{x}=\frac{2}{5}$
The lowest common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, i.e. the lowest algebraic expression that both $x$ and 5 will divide into, is $5 x$.

Multiplying both sides by $5 x$ gives
$$\begin{array}{rlrl} 
& 5 x\left(\frac{4}{x}\right) & =5 x\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \\
& \text { Cancelling gives } & 5(4) & =x(2) \\
\text { i.e. } & 20 & =2 x
\end{array}$$

Dividing both sides by 2 gives $\frac{20}{2}=\frac{2 x}{2}$
Cancelling gives $\quad \mathbf{1 0}=\boldsymbol{x}$ or $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{1 0}$
which is the solution of the equation $\frac{4}{x}=\frac{2}{5}$
When there is just one fraction on each side of the equation as in this example, there is a quick way to arrive at equation (1) without needing to find the LCM of the denominators.
We can move from $\frac{4}{x}=\frac{2}{5}$ to $4 \times 5=2 \times x$ by what is called 'cross-multiplication'.
In general, if $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$ then $a d=b c$
We can use cross-multiplication when there is one fraction only on each side of the equation.

Problem 10. Solve the equation $\frac{3}{t-2}=\frac{4}{3 t+4}$

Cross-multiplication gives $3(3 t+4)=4(t-2)$
Removing brackets gives $\quad 9 t+12=4 t-8$
Rearranging gives $\quad 9 t-4 t=-8-12$
i.e.
$$5 t=-20$$

Dividing both sides by 5 gives $\quad t=\frac{-20}{5}=-4$
which is the solution of the equation $\frac{3}{t-2}=\frac{4}{3 t+4}$
Problem 11. Solve the equation
$$\frac{2 y}{5}+\frac{3}{4}+5=\frac{1}{20}-\frac{3 y}{2}$$

The lowest common multiple (LCM) of the denominators is 20 ; i.e., the lowest number that $4,5,20$ and 2 will divide into.
Multiplying each term by 20 gives
$20\left(\frac{2 y}{5}\right)+20\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)+20(5)=20\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)-20\left(\frac{3 y}{2}\right)$
Cancelling gives $\quad 4(2 y)+5(3)+100=1-10(3 y)$ i.e.
$$8 y+15+100=1-30 y$$

Rearranging gives $\quad 8 y+30 y=1-15-100$
i.e.

Dividing both sides by 38 gives
Cancelling gives
$38 y=-114$
$\frac{38 y}{38}=\frac{-114}{38}$ $y=-3$
which is the solution of the equation
$$\frac{2 y}{5}+\frac{3}{4}+5=\frac{1}{20}-\frac{3 y}{2}$$

\section*{Problem 12. Solve the equation $\sqrt{x}=2$}

Whenever square root signs are involved in an equation, both sides of the equation must be squared.

Squaring both sides gives $(\sqrt{x})^{2}=(2)^{2}$
i.e.
$$x=4$$
which is the solution of the equation $\sqrt{x}=2$.
Problem 13. Solve the equation $2 \sqrt{d}=8$

Whenever square roots are involved in an equation, the square root term needs to be isolated on its own before squaring both sides.
Cross-multiplying gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{d} & =\frac{8}{2} \\
\sqrt{d} & =4
\end{aligned}$$

Cancelling gives
Squaring both sides gives $(\sqrt{d})^{2}=(4)^{2}$
i.e.
$$d=16$$
which is the solution of the equation $2 \sqrt{d}=8$.
Problem 14. Solve the equation $\left(\frac{\sqrt{b}+3}{\sqrt{b}}\right)=2$
Cross-multiplying gives $\sqrt{b}+3=2 \sqrt{b}$
Rearranging gives
$$3=2 \sqrt{b}-\sqrt{b}$$
i.e.
$$3=\sqrt{b}$$

Squaring both sides gives
$$9=b$$
which is the solution of the equation $\left(\frac{\sqrt{b}+3}{\sqrt{b}}\right)=2$.

\section*{Problem 15. Solve the equation $x^{2}=25$}

Whenever a square term is involved, the square root of both sides of the equation must be taken.

Taking the square root of both sides gives $\sqrt{x^{2}}=\sqrt{25}$
i.e.
$$x= \pm 5$$
which is the solution of the equation $x^{2}=25$.
Problem 16. Solve the equation $\frac{15}{4 t^{2}}=\frac{2}{3}$
We need to rearrange the equation to get the $t^{2}$ term on its own.

Cross-multiplying gives
$$15(3)=2\left(4 t^{2}\right)$$
i.e.
$$45=8 t^{2}$$

Dividing both sides by 8 gives $\frac{45}{8}=\frac{8 t^{2}}{8}$
By cancelling
$$5.625=t^{2}$$
or
$$t^{2}=5.625$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{t^{2}} & =\sqrt{5.625} \\
\boldsymbol{t} & = \pm \mathbf{2 . 3 7 2}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
correct to 4 significant figures, which is the solution of the equation $\frac{15}{4 t^{2}}=\frac{2}{3}$

\subsection*{11.3 Practical problems involving simple equations}

There are many practical situations in engineering in which solving equations is needed. Here are some worked examples to demonstrate typical practical situations

Problem 17. Applying the principle of moments to a beam results in the equation
$$F \times 3=(7.5-F) \times 2$$
where $F$ is the force in newtons. Determine the value of $F$

Removing brackets gives $\quad 3 F=15-2 F$
Rearranging gives $\quad 3 F+2 F=15$
i.e.
$$5 F=15$$

Dividing both sides by 5 gives $\frac{5 F}{5}=\frac{15}{5}$
from which, force, $\boldsymbol{F}=\mathbf{3 N}$.
Problem 18. A copper wire has a length $L$ of 1.5 km , a resistance $R$ of $5 \Omega$ and a resistivity of $17.2 \times 10^{-6} \Omega \mathrm{~mm}$. Find the cross-sectional area, $a$, of the wire, given that $R=\frac{\rho L}{a}$

Since $R=\frac{\rho L}{a}$ then
$$5 \Omega=\frac{\left(17.2 \times 10^{-6} \Omega \mathrm{~mm}\right)\left(1500 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~mm}\right)}{a} .$$

From the units given, $a$ is measured in $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.
Thus, $5 a=17.2 \times 10^{-6} \times 1500 \times 10^{3}$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
a & =\frac{17.2 \times 10^{-6} \times 1500 \times 10^{3}}{5} \\
& =\frac{17.2 \times 1500 \times 10^{3}}{10^{6} \times 5}=\frac{17.2 \times 15}{10 \times 5}=5.16
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the cross-sectional area of the wire is $\mathbf{5 . 1 6} \mathbf{~ m m}^{2}$.

Problem 19. $P V=m R T$ is the characteristic gas equation. Find the value of gas constant $R$ when pressure $P=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Pa}$, volume $V=0.90 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, mass $m=2.81 \mathrm{~kg}$ and temperature $T=231 \mathrm{~K}$

Dividing both sides of $P V=m R T$ by $m T$ gives
$$\frac{P V}{m T}=\frac{m R T}{m T}$$

Cancelling gives $\quad \frac{P V}{m T}=R$
Substituting values gives $\quad R=\frac{\left(3 \times 10^{6}\right)(0.90)}{(2.81)(231)}$

Using a calculator, gas constant, $R=\mathbf{4 1 6 0} \mathbf{J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$, correct to 4 significant figures.

Problem 20. A rectangular box with square ends has its length 15 cm greater than its breadth and the total length of its edges is 2.04 m . Find the width of the box and its volume

Let $x \mathrm{~cm}=$ width $=$ height of box. Then the length of the box is $(x+15) \mathrm{cm}$, as shown in Figure 11.1.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-091.jpg?height=356&width=427&top_left_y=755&top_left_x=443)

\section*{Figure 11.1}

The length of the edges of the box is $2(4 x)+4(x+15)$ cm , which equals 2.04 m or 204 cm .

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
204 & =2(4 x)+4(x+15) \\
204 & =8 x+4 x+60 \\
204-60 & =12 x \\
144 & =12 x \\
x & =12 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
and
Hence, the width of the box is 12 cm .
Volume of box $=$ length $\times$ width $\times$ height
$$\begin{aligned}
& =(x+15)(x)(x)=(12+15)(12)(12) \\
& =(27)(12)(12) \\
& =\mathbf{3 8 8 8} \mathbf{c m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 21. The temperature coefficient of resistance $\alpha$ may be calculated from the formula $R_{t}=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$. Find $\alpha$, given $R_{t}=0.928$, $R_{0}=0.80$ and $t=40$

Since $R_{t}=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$, then
$$\begin{aligned}
0.928 & =0.80[1+\alpha(40)] \\
0.928 & =0.80+(0.8)(\alpha)(40) \\
0.928-0.80 & =32 \alpha \\
0.128 & =32 \alpha
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$\alpha=\frac{0.128}{32}=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 4}$$

Problem 22. The distance $s$ metres travelled in time $t$ seconds is given by the formula $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$, where $u$ is the initial velocity in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $a$ is the acceleration in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Find the acceleration of the body if it travels 168 m in 6 s , with an initial velocity of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
$$s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}, \text { and } s=168, u=10 \text { and } t=6$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
168 & =(10)(6)+\frac{1}{2} a(6)^{2} \\
168 & =60+18 a \\
168-60 & =18 a \\
108 & =18 a \\
a=\frac{108}{18} & =6
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the acceleration of the body is $\mathbf{6} \mathbf{m} / \mathrm{s}^{\mathbf{2}}$.
Problem 23. When three resistors in an electrical circuit are connected in parallel the total resistance $R_{T}$ is given by $\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}$. Find the total resistance when $R_{1}=5 \Omega, R_{2}=10 \Omega$ and $R_{3}=30 \Omega$
$$\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{30}=\frac{6+3+1}{30}=\frac{10}{30}=\frac{1}{3}$$

Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $\boldsymbol{R}_{\boldsymbol{T}}=\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{\Omega}$ Alternatively, if $\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{30}$, the LCM of the denominators is $30 R_{T}$.

Hence, $30 R_{T}\left(\frac{1}{R_{T}}\right)=30 R_{T}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)$
$$+30 R_{T}\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)+30 R_{T}\left(\frac{1}{30}\right) .$$

Cancelling gives $\quad 30=6 R_{T}+3 R_{T}+R_{T}$ i.e.
$$30=10 R_{T}$$
and
$$\boldsymbol{R}_{T}=\frac{30}{10}=\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{\Omega}, \text { as above. }$$

7. The distance, $s$, travelled in time $t$ seconds is given by the formula $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ where $u$ is the initial velocity in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $a$ is the acceleration in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Calculate the acceleration of the body if it travels 165 m in 3 s , with an initial velocity of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

Here are some further worked examples on solving simple equations in practical situations.

Problem 24. The extension $x \mathrm{~m}$ of an aluminium tie bar of length $l \mathrm{~m}$ and cross-sectional area $A \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ when carrying a load of $F$ Newtons is given by the modulus of elasticity $E=F l / A x$. Find the extension of the tie bar (in mm) if $E=70 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}, F=20 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N}, A=0.1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and $l=1.4 \mathrm{~m}$
$E=F l / A x$, hence
$$70 \times 10^{9} \frac{\mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~m}^{2}}=\frac{\left(20 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N}\right)(1.4 \mathrm{~m})}{\left(0.1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)(x)}$$
(the unit of $x$ is thus metres)
$$\begin{aligned}
70 \times 10^{9} \times 0.1 \times x & =20 \times 10^{6} \times 1.4 \\
x & =\frac{20 \times 10^{6} \times 1.4}{70 \times 10^{9} \times 0.1}
\end{aligned}$$

Cancelling gives
$$\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{2 \times 1.4}{7 \times 100} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =\frac{2 \times 1.4}{7 \times 100} \times 1000 \mathrm{~mm} \\
& =4 \mathrm{~mm}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the extension of the tie bar, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{4} \mathbf{~ m m}$.
Problem 25. Power in a d.c. circuit is given by $P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$ where $V$ is the supply voltage and $R$ is the circuit resistance. Find the supply voltage if the circuit resistance is $1.25 \Omega$ and the power measured is 320 W

Since $P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}, \quad$ then $\quad 320=\frac{V^{2}}{1.25}$
$$\begin{aligned}
(320)(1.25) & =V^{2} \\
V^{2} & =400
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.

Supply voltage,
$$V=\sqrt{400}= \pm 20 \mathrm{~V}$$

Problem 26. A painter is paid $Â£ 6.30$ per hour for a basic 36 hour week and overtime is paid at one and a third times this rate. Determine how many hours the painter has to work in a week to earn $Â£ 319.20$

Basic rate per hour $=Â£ 6.30$ and overtime rate per hour
$$=1 \frac{1}{3} \times Â£ 6.30=Â£ 8.40$$

Let the number of overtime hours worked $=x$
Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
(36)(6.30)+(x)(8.40) & =319.20 \\
226.80+8.40 x & =319.20
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
8.40 x & =319.20-226.80=92.40 \\
x & =\frac{92.40}{8.40}=11
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, 11 hours overtime would have to be worked to earn $Â£ 319.20$ per week. Hence, the total number of hours worked is $36+11$, i.e. $\mathbf{4 7}$ hours.

Problem 27. A formula relating initial and final states of pressures, $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, volumes, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, and absolute temperatures, $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$, of an ideal gas is $\frac{P_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}$. Find the value of $P_{2}$ given $P_{1}=100 \times 10^{3}, V_{1}=1.0, V_{2}=0.266, T_{1}=423$ and $T_{2}=293$

Since $\frac{P_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}$
then $\frac{\left(100 \times 10^{3}\right)(1.0)}{423}=\frac{P_{2}(0.266)}{293}$
Cross-multiplying gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(100 \times 10^{3}\right)(1.0)(293) & =P_{2}(0.266)(423) \\
& P_{2}
\end{aligned}=\frac{\left(100 \times 10^{3}\right)(1.0)(293)}{(0.266)(423)}, \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{2}}=\mathbf{2 6 0 \times \mathbf { 1 0 } ^ { \mathbf { 3 } } \text { or } \mathbf { 2 . 6 } \times \mathbf { 1 0 } ^ { \mathbf { 5 } } .}$$

Problem 28. The stress, $f$, in a material of a thick cylinder can be obtained from $\frac{D}{d}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{f+p}{f-p}\right)}$. Calculate the stress, given that $D=21.5, d=10.75$ and $p=1800$

Since $\frac{D}{d}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{f+p}{f-p}\right)}$ then $\frac{21.5}{10.75}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{f+1800}{f-1800}\right)}$ i.e.

Squaring both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
2 & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{f+1800}{f-1800}\right)} \\
4 & =\frac{f+1800}{f-1800}
\end{aligned}$$

Cross-multiplying gives
$$\begin{aligned}
4(f-1800) & =f+1800 \\
4 f-7200 & =f+1800 \\
4 f-f & =1800+7200 \\
3 f & =9000 \\
f & =\frac{9000}{3}=3000
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
stress, $f=3000$

Problem 29. 12 workmen employed on a building site earn between them a total of $Â£ 4035$ per week. Labourers are paid $Â£ 275$ per week and craftsmen are paid $Â£ 380$ per week. How many craftsmen and how many labourers are employed?

Let the number of craftsmen be $c$. The number of labourers is therefore $(12-c)$.

The wage bill equation is
$$\begin{aligned}
380 c+275(12-c) & =4035 \\
380 c+3300-275 c & =4035 \\
380 c-275 c & =4035-3300 \\
105 c & =735 \\
c & =\frac{735}{105}=7
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, there are 7 craftsmen and ( $12-7$ ), i.e. 5 labourers on the site.

\section*{Chapter 12}

\section*{Transposing formulae}

\subsection*{12.1 Introduction}

In the formula $I=\frac{V}{R}, I$ is called the subject of the formula.
Similarly, in the formula $y=m x+c, y$ is the subject of the formula.
When a symbol other than the subject is required to be the subject, the formula needs to be rearranged to make a new subject. This rearranging process is called transposing the formula or transposition.
For example, in the above formulae,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { if } I & =\frac{V}{R} \text { then } V=I R \\
\text { and if } y & =m x+c \text { then } x=\frac{y-c}{m}
\end{aligned}$$

How did we arrive at these transpositions? This is the purpose of this chapter - to show how to transpose formulae. A great many equations occur in engineering and it is essential that we can transpose them when needed.

\subsection*{12.2 Transposing formulae}

There are no new rules for transposing formulae. The same rules as were used for simple equations in Chapter 11 are used; i.e., the balance of an equation must be maintained: whatever is done to one side of an equation must be done to the other.
It is best that you cover simple equations before trying this chapter.
Here are some worked examples to help understanding of transposing formulae.

\footnotetext{
Problem 1. Transpose $p=q+r+s$ to make $r$ the subject
}

The object is to obtain $r$ on its own on the LHS of the equation. Changing the equation around so that $r$ is on the LHS gives
$$q+r+s=p$$

From Chapter 11 on simple equations, a term can be moved from one side of an equation to the other side as long as the sign is changed.
Rearranging gives $r=\boldsymbol{p} \boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{s}$.
Mathematically, we have subtracted $q+s$ from both sides of equation (1).

Problem 2. If $a+b=w-x+y$, express $x$ as the subject

As stated in Problem 1, a term can be moved from one side of an equation to the other side but with a change of sign.
Hence, rearranging gives $x=w+y-a-b$

Problem 3. Transpose $v=f \lambda$ to make $\lambda$ the subject
$v=f \lambda$ relates velocity $v$, frequency $f$ and wavelength $\lambda$

Rearranging gives
$$f \lambda=v$$

Dividing both sides by $f$ gives $\frac{f \lambda}{f}=\frac{v}{f}$
Cancelling gives
$$\lambda=\frac{v}{f}$$

Problem 4. When a body falls freely through a height $h$, the velocity $v$ is given by $v^{2}=2 g h$. Express this formula with $h$ as the subject

Rearranging gives
$$2 g h=v^{2}$$

Dividing both sides by $2 g$ gives $\frac{2 g h}{2 g}=\frac{v^{2}}{2 g}$
Cancelling gives
$$h=\frac{v^{2}}{2 g}$$

Problem 5. If $I=\frac{V}{R}$, rearrange to make $V$ the subject
$I=\frac{V}{R}$ is Ohm's law, where $I$ is the current, $V$ is the voltage and $R$ is the resistance.

Rearranging gives
$$\frac{V}{R}=I$$

Multiplying both sides by $R$ gives $\quad R\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)=R(I)$
Cancelling gives
$$V=I R$$

Problem 6. Transpose $a=\frac{F}{m}$ for $m$
$a=\frac{F}{m}$ relates acceleration $a$, force $F$ and mass $m$.
Rearranging gives
$$\frac{F}{m}=a$$

Multiplying both sides by $m$ gives $m\left(\frac{F}{m}\right)=m(a)$

Cancelling gives
Rearranging gives
Dividing both sides by $a$ gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
F & =m a \\
m a & =F
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{m a}{a} & =\frac{F}{a} \\
\boldsymbol{m} & =\frac{\boldsymbol{F}}{\boldsymbol{a}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. Rearrange the formula $R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$ to make (a) $A$ the subject and (b) $L$ the subject
$R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$ relates resistance $R$ of a conductor, resistivity $\rho$, conductor length $L$ and conductor cross-sectional area $A$.
(a) Rearranging gives
$$\frac{\rho L}{A}=R$$

Multiplying both sides by $A$ gives
$$A\left(\frac{\rho L}{A}\right)=A(R)$$

Cancelling gives
$$\rho L=A R$$

Rearranging gives
$$A R=\rho l$$

Dividing both sides by $R$ gives
$$\frac{A R}{R}=\frac{\rho L}{R}$$

Cancelling gives
$$A=\frac{\rho L}{R}$$
(b) Multiplying both sides of $\frac{\rho L}{A}=R$ by $A$ gives
$$\rho L=A R$$

Dividing both sides by $\rho$ gives $\frac{\rho L}{\rho}=\frac{A R}{\rho}$
Cancelling gives
$$L=\frac{A R}{\rho}$$

Problem 8. Transpose $y=m x+c$ to make $m$ the subject
$y=m x+c$ is the equation of a straight line graph, where $y$ is the vertical axis variable, $x$ is the horizontal axis variable, $m$ is the gradient of the graph and $c$ is the $y$-axis intercept.
Subtracting $c$ from both sides gives
$$y-c=m x$$
or
$$m x=y-c$$

Dividing both sides by $x$ gives
$$m=\frac{y-c}{x}$$

\subsection*{12.3 Further transposing of formulae}

Here are some more transposition examples to help us further understand how more difficult formulae are transposed.

Problem 9. Transpose the formula $v=u+\frac{F t}{m}$ to make $F$ the subject
$v=u+\frac{F t}{m}$ relates final velocity $v$, initial velocity $u$, force $F$, mass $m$ and time $t$. $\frac{F}{m}$ is acceleration $\left.a.\right)$
Rearranging gives $\quad u+\frac{F t}{m}=v$
and
$$\frac{F t}{m}=v-u$$

Multiplying each side by $m$ gives
$$m\left(\frac{F t}{m}\right)=m(v-u)$$

Cancelling gives
$$F t=m(v-u)$$

Dividing both sides by $t$ gives $\frac{F t}{t}=\frac{m(v-u)}{t}$
Cancelling gives $F=\frac{\boldsymbol{m}(\boldsymbol{v}-\boldsymbol{u})}{\boldsymbol{t}}$ or $\boldsymbol{F}=\frac{\boldsymbol{m}}{\boldsymbol{t}}(\boldsymbol{v}-\boldsymbol{u})$
This shows two ways of expressing the answer. There is often more than one way of expressing a transposed answer. In this case, these equations for $F$ are equivalent; neither one is more correct than the other.

Problem 10. The final length $L_{2}$ of a piece of wire heated through $\theta^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by the formula $L_{2}=L_{1}(1+\alpha \theta)$ where $L_{1}$ is the original length. Make the coefficient of expansion $\alpha$ the subject

Rearranging gives
$$L_{1}(1+\alpha \theta)=L_{2}$$

Removing the bracket gives
$$L_{1}+L_{1} \alpha \theta=L_{2}$$

Rearranging gives
$$L_{1} \alpha \theta=L_{2}-L_{1}$$

Dividing both sides by $L_{1} \theta$ gives $\frac{L_{1} \alpha \theta}{L_{1} \theta}=\frac{L_{2}-L_{1}}{L_{1} \theta}$
Cancelling gives
$$\alpha=\frac{L_{2}-L_{1}}{L_{1} \theta}$$

An alternative method of transposing $L_{2}=L_{1}(1+\alpha \theta)$ for $\alpha$ is:

Dividing both sides by $L_{1}$ gives $\quad \frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}=1+\alpha \theta$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}-1=\alpha \theta$
or
$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha \theta & =\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}-1 \\
\alpha & =\frac{\frac{\boldsymbol{L}_{\mathbf{2}}}{\boldsymbol{L}_{\mathbf{1}}}-\mathbf{1}}{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing both sides by $\theta$ gives
$$L_{1}{ }_{2}$$

The two answers $\alpha=\frac{L_{2}-L_{1}}{L_{1} \theta}$ and $\alpha=\frac{\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}-1}{\theta}$ look quite different. They are, however, equivalent. The first answer looks tidier but is no more correct than the second answer.

Problem 11. A formula for the distance $s$ moved by a body is given by $s=\frac{1}{2}(v+u) t$. Rearrange the formula to make $u$ the subject

Rearranging gives
$$\frac{1}{2}(v+u) t=s$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives
$$(v+u) t=2 s$$

Dividing both sides by $t$ gives
$$\frac{(v+u) t}{t}=\frac{2 s}{t}$$

Cancelling gives
$$v+u=\frac{2 s}{t}$$

Rearranging gives $\quad u=\frac{2 s}{t}-v$ or $u=\frac{2 s-v t}{t}$

\section*{Problem 12. A formula for kinetic energy is} $k=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$. Transpose the formula to make $v$ the subject

Rearranging gives $\quad \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=k$

Whenever the prospective new subject is a squared term, that term is isolated on the LHS and then the square root of both sides of the equation is taken.

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives
$$m v^{2}=2 k$$

Dividing both sides by $m$ gives
$\frac{m v^{2}}{m}=\frac{2 k}{m}$
Cancelling gives
$$v^{2}=\frac{2 k}{m}$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{v^{2}} & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{2 k}{m}\right)} \\
v & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{2 k}{\boldsymbol{m}}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 13. In a right-angled triangle having sides $x, y$ and hypotenuse $z$, Pythagoras' theorem states $z^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$. Transpose the formula to find $x$

Rearranging gives
$$\begin{aligned}
x^{2}+y^{2} & =z^{2} \\
x^{2} & =z^{2}-y^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
and
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-099.jpg?height=23&width=26&top_left_y=1374&top_left_x=303)

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$x=\sqrt{z^{2}-y^{2}}$$

Problem 14. Transpose $y=\frac{M L^{2}}{8 E I}$ to make $L$ the subject

Multiplying both sides by $8 E I$ gives
$$8 E I y=M L^{2}$$

Dividing both sides by $M$ gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{8 E I y}{M} & =L^{2} \\
L^{2} & =\frac{8 E I y}{M}
\end{aligned}$$
or
or
Taking the square root of both sides gives
i.e.
$$\sqrt{L^{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{8 E I y}{M}}$$
$$L=\sqrt{\frac{8 E I y}{M}}$$

Problem 15. Given $t=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$, find $g$ in terms of $t, l$ and $\pi$

Whenever the prospective new subject is within a square root sign, it is best to isolate that term on the LHS and then to square both sides of the equation.

Rearranging gives
$$2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}=t$$

Dividing both sides by $2 \pi$ gives
$$\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}=\frac{t}{2 \pi}$$

Squaring both sides gives
$$\frac{l}{g}=\left(\frac{t}{2 \pi}\right)^{2}=\frac{t^{2}}{4 \pi^{2}}$$

Cross-multiplying, (i.e. multiplying each term by $4 \pi^{2} g$ ), gives
$$4 \pi^{2} l=g t^{2}$$
or
$$g t^{2}=4 \pi^{2} l$$

Dividing both sides by $t^{2}$ gives
$$\frac{g t^{2}}{t^{2}}=\frac{4 \pi^{2} l}{t^{2}}$$

Cancelling gives
$$g=\frac{4 \pi^{2} l}{t^{2}}$$

Problem 16. The impedance $Z$ of an a.c. circuit is given by $Z=\sqrt{R^{2}+X^{2}}$ where $R$ is the resistance. Make the reactance, $X$, the subject

Rearranging gives
$$\sqrt{R^{2}+X^{2}}=Z$$

Squaring both sides gives
$$R^{2}+X^{2}=Z^{2}$$

Rearranging gives
$$X^{2}=Z^{2}-R^{2}$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$X=\sqrt{Z^{2}-R^{2}}$$

Problem 17. The volume $V$ of a hemisphere of radius $r$ is given by $V=\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{3}$. (a) Find $r$ in terms of $V$. (b) Evaluate the radius when $V=32 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
(a) Rearranging gives
$$\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{3}=V$$

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives $2 \pi r^{3}=3 \mathrm{~V}$
Dividing both sides by $2 \pi$ gives $\quad \frac{2 \pi r^{3}}{2 \pi}=\frac{3 V}{2 \pi}$
Cancelling gives
$$r^{3}=\frac{3 V}{2 \pi}$$

Taking the cube root of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt[3]{r^{3}} & =\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{3 V}{2 \pi}\right)} \\
\text { i.e. } \quad r & =\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{\mathbf{3 V}}{\mathbf{2 \pi}}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) When $V=32 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$,
$$\text { radius } r=\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{3 V}{2 \pi}\right)}=\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{3 \times 32}{2 \pi}\right)}=2.48 \mathrm{~cm}$$

\subsection*{12.4 More difficult transposing of formulae}

Here are some more transposition examples to help us further understand how more difficult formulae are transposed.

Problem 18. (a) Transpose $S=\sqrt{\frac{3 d(L-d)}{8}}$ to make $l$ the subject. (b) Evaluate $L$ when $d=1.65$ and $S=0.82$

The formula $S=\sqrt{\frac{3 d(L-d)}{8}}$ represents the sag $S$ at the centre of a wire.
(a) Squaring both sides gives $\quad S^{2}=\frac{3 d(L-d)}{8}$

Multiplying both sides by 8 gives
$$8 S^{2}=3 d(L-d)$$

Dividing both sides by $3 d$ gives $\frac{8 S^{2}}{3 d}=L-d$
Rearranging gives
$$L=d+\frac{8 S^{2}}{3 d}$$
(b) When $d=1.65$ and $S=0.82$,
$$\boldsymbol{L}=d+\frac{8 S^{2}}{3 d}=1.65+\frac{8 \times 0.82^{2}}{3 \times 1.65}=\mathbf{2 . 7 3 7}$$

Problem 19. Transpose the formula $p=\frac{a^{2} x^{2}+a^{2} y}{r}$ to make $a$ the subject

Rearranging give
$$\frac{a^{2} x^{2}+a^{2} y}{r}=p$$

Multiplying both sides by $r$ gives
$$a^{2} x+a^{2} y=r p$$

Factorizing the LHS gives
$$a^{2}(x+y)=r p$$

Dividing both sides by $(x+y)$ gives
$$\frac{a^{2}(x+y)}{(x+y)}=\frac{r p}{(x+y)}$$

Cancelling gives
$$a^{2}=\frac{r p}{(x+y)}$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$a=\sqrt{\left(\frac{r p}{x+y}\right)}$$

Whenever the letter required as the new subject occurs more than once in the original formula, after rearranging, factorizing will always be needed.

Problem 20. Make $b$ the subject of the formula $a=\frac{x-y}{\sqrt{b d+b e}}$

Rearranging gives
$$\frac{x-y}{\sqrt{b d+b e}}=a$$

Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{b d+b e}$ gives
$$x-y=a \sqrt{b d+b e}$$
or
$$a \sqrt{b d+b e}=x-y$$

Dividing both sides by $a$ gives $\sqrt{b d+b e}=\frac{x-y}{a}$
Squaring both sides gives $\quad b d+b e=\left(\frac{x-y}{a}\right)^{2}$
Factorizing the LHS gives $\quad b(d+e)=\left(\frac{x-y}{a}\right)^{2}$
Dividing both sides by $(d+e)$ gives
$$b=\frac{\left(\frac{x-y}{a}\right)^{2}}{(d+e)} \quad \text { or } \quad b=\frac{(x-y)^{2}}{a^{2}(d+e)}$$

Problem 21. If $a=\frac{b}{1+b}$, make $b$ the subject of the formula

Rearranging gives
$$\frac{b}{1+b}=a$$

Multiplying both sides by $(1+b)$ gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& b=a(1+b) \\
& b=a+a b
\end{aligned}$$

Removing the bracket gives
Rearranging to obtain terms in $b$ on the LHS gives
$$b-a b=a$$

Factorizing the LHS gives
$$b(1-a)=a$$

Dividing both sides by $(1-a)$ gives $\boldsymbol{b}=\frac{\boldsymbol{a}}{\mathbf{1 - a}}$

Problem 22. Transpose the formula $V=\frac{E r}{R+r}$ to make $r$ the subject

Rearranging gives
$$\frac{E r}{R+r}=V$$

Multiplying both sides by $(R+r)$ gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& E r=V(R+r) \\
& E r=V R+V r
\end{aligned}$$

Removing the bracket gives
Rearranging to obtain terms in $r$ on the LHS gives
$$\begin{aligned}
E r-V r & =V R \\
r(E-V) & =V R
\end{aligned}$$

Factorizing gives
Dividing both sides by $(E-V)$ gives $\quad \boldsymbol{r}=\frac{\boldsymbol{V} \boldsymbol{R}}{\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{V}}$

Problem 23. Transpose the formula $y=\frac{p q^{2}}{r+q^{2}}-t$ to make $q$ the subject

Rearranging gives $\frac{p q^{2}}{r+q^{2}}-t=y$ and
$$\frac{p q^{2}}{r+q^{2}}=y+t$$

Multiplying both sides by $\left(r+q^{2}\right)$ gives
$$p q^{2}=\left(r+q^{2}\right)(y+t)$$

Removing brackets gives $p q^{2}=r y+r t+q^{2} y+q^{2} t$
Rearranging to obtain terms in $q$ on the LHS gives
$$p q^{2}-q^{2} y-q^{2} t=r y+r t$$

Factorizing gives $q^{2}(p-y-t)=r(y+t)$
Dividing both sides by $(p-y-t)$ gives
$$q^{2}=\frac{r(y+t)}{(p-y-t)}$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$q=\sqrt{\left(\frac{r(y+t)}{p-y-t}\right)}$$

Problem 24. Given that $\frac{D}{d}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{f+p}{f-p}\right)}$ express $p$ in terms of $D, d$ and $f$

Rearranging gives $\quad \sqrt{\left(\frac{f+p}{f-p}\right)}=\frac{D}{d}$
Squaring both sides gives $\quad\left(\frac{f+p}{f-p}\right)=\frac{D^{2}}{d^{2}}$
Cross-multiplying, i.e. multiplying each term by $d^{2}(f-p)$, gives
$$d^{2}(f+p)=D^{2}(f-p)$$

Removing brackets gives $\quad d^{2} f+d^{2} p=D^{2} f-D^{2} p$
Rearranging, to obtain terms in $p$ on the LHS gives
$$d^{2} p+D^{2} p=D^{2} f-d^{2} f$$

Factorizing gives
$$p\left(d^{2}+D^{2}\right)=f\left(D^{2}-d^{2}\right)$$

Dividing both sides by $\left(d^{2}+D^{2}\right)$ gives
$$p=\frac{f\left(D^{2}-d^{2}\right)}{\left(d^{2}+D^{2}\right)}$$

\section*{Solving simultaneous equations}

\subsection*{13.1 Introduction}

Only one equation is necessary when finding the value of a single unknown quantity (as with simple equations in Chapter 11). However, when an equation contains two unknown quantities it has an infinite number of solutions. When two equations are available connecting the same two unknown values then a unique solution is possible. Similarly, for three unknown quantities it is necessary to have three equations in order to solve for a particular value of each of the unknown quantities, and so on.

Equations which have to be solved together to find the unique values of the unknown quantities, which are true for each of the equations, are called simultaneous equations.
Two methods of solving simultaneous equations analytically are:
(a) by substitution, and
(b) by elimination.
(A graphical solution of simultaneous equations is shown in Chapter 19.)

\subsection*{13.2 Solving simultaneous equations in two unknowns}

The method of solving simultaneous equations is demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Problem 1. Solve the following equations for $x$ and $y$, (a) by substitution and (b) by elimination
$$\begin{aligned}
x+2 y & =-1 \\
4 x-3 y & =18
\end{aligned}$$
(a) By substitution

From equation (1): $x=-1-2 y$
Substituting this expression for $x$ into equation (2) gives
$$4(-1-2 y)-3 y=18$$

This is now a simple equation in $y$. Removing the bracket gives
$$\begin{aligned}
-4-8 y-3 y & =18 \\
-11 y & =18+4=22 \\
y & =\frac{22}{-11}=-2
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $y=-2$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
x+2(-2) & =-1 \\
x-4 & =-1 \\
x & =-1+4=3
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{- 2}$ is the solution to the simultaneous equations.
Check: in equation (2), since $x=3$ and $y=-2$,
$$\mathrm{LHS}=4(3)-3(-2)=12+6=18=\text { RHS }$$
(b) By elimination
$$\begin{aligned}
x+2 y & =-1 \\
4 x-3 y & =18
\end{aligned}$$

If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 4 , the coefficient of $x$ will be the same as in equation (2), giving
$$4 x+8 y=-4$$

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 4 x-3 y=18 \\
& 4 x+8 y=-4 \\
& \hline 0-11 y=22 \\
& \hline
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad \boldsymbol{y}=\frac{22}{-11}=-\mathbf{2}$
(Note: in the above subtraction,
$$18--4=18+4=22 .)$$

Substituting $y=-2$ into either equation (1) or equation (2) will give $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$ as in method (a). The solution $x=3, y=-2$ is the only pair of values that satisfies both of the original equations.

Problem 2. Solve, by a substitution method, the simultaneous equations
$$\begin{aligned}
3 x-2 y & =12 \\
x+3 y & =-7
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (2), $x=-7-3 y$
Substituting for $x$ in equation (1) gives
$$3(-7-3 y)-2 y=12$$
i.e.
$$\begin{array}{r}
-21-9 y-2 y=12 \\
-11 y=12+21=33
\end{array}$$

Hence, $y=\frac{33}{-11}=-3$
Substituting $y=-3$ in equation (2) gives
$$x+3(-3)=-7$$
i.e.
$$x-9=-7$$

Hence
$$x=-7+9=2$$

Thus, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{- 3}$ is the solution of the simultaneous equations. (Such solutions should always be checked
by substituting values into each of the original two equations.)

Problem 3. Use an elimination method to solve the following simultaneous equations
$$\begin{aligned}
& 3 x+4 y=5 \\
& 2 x-5 y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 2 and equation (2) by 3 , the coefficient of $x$ will be the same in the newly formed equations. Thus,
$$\begin{array}{lc}
2 \times \text { equation (1) gives } & 6 x+8 y=10 \\
3 \times \text { equation (2) gives } & 6 x-15 y=-36
\end{array}$$

Equation (3) - equation (4) gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 0+23 y=46 \\
& \boldsymbol{y}=\frac{46}{23}=\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$
$($ Note $+8 y--15 y=8 y+15 y=23 y$ and $10--36=$ $10+36=46$.)

Substituting $y=2$ in equation (1) gives
from which
$$3 x+4(2)=5$$
and
$$3 x=5-8=-3$$
$$x=-1$$

Checking, by substituting $x=-1$ and $y=2$ in equation (2), gives
$$\text { LHS }=2(-1)-5(2)=-2-10=-12=\text { RHS }$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{2}$ is the solution of the simultaneous equations.
The elimination method is the most common method of solving simultaneous equations.

Problem 4. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& 7 x-2 y=26 \\
& 6 x+5 y=29
\end{aligned}$$

When equation (1) is multiplied by 5 and equation (2) by 2 , the coefficients of $y$ in each equation are numerically the same, i.e. 10 , but are of opposite sign.
\begin{tabular}{lr}
$5 \times$ equation (1) gives & $35 x-10 y=130$ \\
$2 \times$ equation (2) gives & $12 x+10 y=58$ \\
\begin{tabular}{lr} 
Adding equations (3) \\
and (4) gives
\end{tabular} & $47 x+0=188$ \\
Hence, & $x=\frac{188}{47}=\mathbf{4}$
\end{tabular}

Note that when the signs of common coefficients are different the two equations are added and when the signs of common coefficients are the same the two equations are subtracted (as in Problems 1 and 3).

Substituting $x=4$ in equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
7(4)-2 y & =26 \\
28-2 y & =26 \\
28-26 & =2 y \\
2 & =2 y \\
y & =\mathbf{1}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,

Checking, by substituting $x=4$ and $y=1$ in equation (2), gives
$$\mathrm{LHS}=6(4)+5(1)=24+5=29=\text { RHS }$$

Thus, the solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{4}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{1}$.

\subsection*{13.3 Further solving of simultaneous equations}

Here are some further worked problems on solving simultaneous equations.

Problem 5. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& 3 p=2 q \\
& 4 p+q+11=0
\end{aligned}$$

Rearranging gives
$$\begin{aligned}
3 p-2 q & =0 \\
4 p+q & =-11
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation (4) by 2 gives
$$8 p+2 q=-22$$

Adding equations (3) and (5) gives
$$\begin{gathered}
11 p+0=-22 \\
p=\frac{-22}{11}=-2
\end{gathered}$$

Substituting $p=-2$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
3(-2) & =2 q \\
-6 & =2 q \\
q & =\frac{-6}{2}=-3
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, by substituting $p=-2$ and $q=-3$ into equation (2), gives

LHS $=4(-2)+(-3)+11=-8-3+11=0=$ RHS
Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{p}=\mathbf{- 2}, \boldsymbol{q}=\mathbf{- 3}$.

\section*{Problem 6. Solve}
$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{x}{8}+\frac{5}{2}=y \\
13-\frac{y}{3}=3 x
\end{gathered}$$

Whenever fractions are involved in simultaneous equations it is often easier to firstly remove them. Thus, multiplying equation (1) by 8 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
8\left(\frac{x}{8}\right)+8\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) & =8 y \\
\text { i.e. } \quad x+20 & =8 y
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation (2) by 3 gives
$$39-y=9 x$$

Rearranging equations (3) and (4) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& x-8 y=-20 \\
& 9 x+y=39
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation (6) by 8 gives
$$72 x+8 y=312$$

Adding equations (5) and (7) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 73 x+0=292 \\
& x=\frac{292}{73}=4
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=4$ into equation (5) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
4-8 y & =-20 \\
4+20 & =8 y \\
24 & =8 y \\
y=\frac{24}{8} & =\mathbf{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, substituting $x=4$ and $y=3$ in the original equations, gives
(1): LHS $=\frac{4}{8}+\frac{5}{2}=\frac{1}{2}+2 \frac{1}{2}=3=y=$ RHS
(2): LHS $=13-\frac{3}{3}=13-1=12$
$$\text { RHS }=3 x=3(4)=12$$

Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{4}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{3}$.

Problem 7. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& 2.5 x+0.75-3 y=0 \\
& 1.6 x=1.08-1.2 y
\end{aligned}$$

It is often easier to remove decimal fractions. Thus, multiplying equations (1) and (2) by 100 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 250 x+75-300 y=0 \\
& 160 x=108-120 y
\end{aligned}$$

Rearranging gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 250 x-300 y=-75 \\
& 160 x+120 y=108
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation (3) by 2 gives
$$500 x-600 y=-150$$

Multiplying equation (4) by 5 gives
$$800 x+600 y=540$$

Adding equations (5) and (6) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 1300 x+0=390 \\
& \boldsymbol{x}=\frac{390}{1300}=\frac{39}{130}=\frac{3}{10}=\mathbf{0 . 3}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=0.3$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
250(0.3)+75-300 y & =0 \\
75+75 & =300 y \\
150 & =300 y \\
y=\frac{150}{300} & =\mathbf{0 . 5}
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, by substituting $x=0.3$ and $y=0.5$ in equation (2), gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { LHS }=160(0.3)=48 \\
& \text { RHS }=108-120(0.5)=108-60=48
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{0 . 3}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{0 . 5}$

\subsection*{13.4 Solving more difficult simultaneous equations}

Here are some further worked problems on solving more difficult simultaneous equations.

Problem 8. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2}{x}+\frac{3}{y}=7 \\
& \frac{1}{x}-\frac{4}{y}=-2
\end{aligned}$$

In this type of equation the solution is easier if a substitution is initially made. Let $\frac{1}{x}=a$ and $\frac{1}{y}=b$
$$\begin{array}{lr}
\text { Thus equation (1) becomes } & 2 a+3 b=7 \\
\text { and equation (2) becomes } & a-4 b=-2
\end{array}$$

Multiplying equation (4) by 2 gives
$$2 a-8 b=-4$$

Subtracting equation (5) from equation (3) gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
0+11 b & =11 \\
\boldsymbol{b} & =\mathbf{1}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $b=1$ in equation (3) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
2 a+3 & =7 \\
2 a=7-3 & =4 \\
a & =\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.

Checking, substituting $a=2$ and $b=1$ in equation (4), gives
$$\mathrm{LHS}=2-4(1)=2-4=-2=\mathrm{RHS}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{2}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{1}$.
However, since $\quad \frac{1}{x}=a, \quad x=\frac{1}{a}=\frac{1}{2}$ or 0.5
and since $\quad \frac{1}{y}=b, \quad y=\frac{1}{b}=\frac{1}{1}=1$
Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{0 . 5}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{1}$.
Problem 9. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{2 a}+\frac{3}{5 b}=4 \\
& \frac{4}{a}+\frac{1}{2 b}=10.5
\end{aligned}$$

Let $\frac{1}{a}=x \quad$ and $\quad \frac{1}{b}=y$
then
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x}{2}+\frac{3}{5} y=4 \\
& 4 x+\frac{1}{2} y=10.5
\end{aligned}$$

To remove fractions, equation (3) is multiplied by 10 , giving
i.e.
$$10\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+10\left(\frac{3}{5} y\right)=10(4)$$
$$5 x+6 y=40$$

Multiplying equation (4) by 2 gives
$$8 x+y=21$$

Multiplying equation (6) by 6 gives
$$48 x+6 y=126$$

Subtracting equation (5) from equation (7) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
43 x+0 & =86 \\
\boldsymbol{x} & =\frac{86}{43}=\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=2$ into equation (3) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2}{2}+\frac{3}{5} y & =4 \\
\frac{3}{5} y & =4-1=3 \\
y & =\frac{5}{3}(3)=\mathbf{5}
\end{aligned}$$

Since $\quad \frac{1}{a}=x, a=\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{2}$ or 0.5 and since $\frac{1}{b}=y, \quad b=\frac{1}{y}=\frac{1}{5}$ or 0.2

Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{0 . 5}, \boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0 . 2}$, which may be checked in the original equations.

Problem 10. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{x+y}=\frac{4}{27} \\
& \frac{1}{2 x-y}=\frac{4}{33}
\end{aligned}$$

To eliminate fractions, both sides of equation (1) are multiplied by 27 $(x+y)$, giving
$$27(x+y)\left(\frac{1}{x+y}\right)=27(x+y)\left(\frac{4}{27}\right)$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
27(1) & =4(x+y) \\
27 & =4 x+4 y
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, in equation (2) $33=4(2 x-y)$
i.e.
$$33=8 x-4 y$$

Equation (3) + equation (4) gives
$$60=12 x \text { and } \boldsymbol{x}=\frac{60}{12}=\mathbf{5}$$

Substituting $x=5$ in equation (3) gives
$$27=4(5)+4 y$$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { from which } \quad 4 y=27-20=7 \\
& \text { and } \\
& \boldsymbol{y}=\frac{7}{4}=\mathbf{1} \frac{\mathbf{3}}{4} \text { or } \mathbf{1 . 7 5}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{5}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{1 . 7 5}$ is the required solution, which may be checked in the original equations.

Problem 11. Solve
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x-1}{3}+\frac{y+2}{5}=\frac{2}{15} \\
& \frac{1-x}{6}+\frac{5+y}{2}=\frac{5}{6}
\end{aligned}$$

Before equations (1) and (2) can be simultaneously solved, the fractions need to be removed and the equations rearranged.

Multiplying equation (1) by 15 gives
$$15\left(\frac{x-1}{3}\right)+15\left(\frac{y+2}{5}\right)=15\left(\frac{2}{15}\right)$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
5(x-1)+3(y+2) & =2 \\
5 x-5+3 y+6 & =2 \\
5 x+3 y & =2+5-6 \\
5 x+3 y & =1
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$0$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
(1-x)+3(5+y) & =5 \\
1-x+15+3 y & =5 \\
-x+3 y & =5-1-15 \\
-x+3 y & =-11
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,

Thus the initial problem containing fractions can be expressed as
$$\begin{aligned}
5 x+3 y & =1 \\
-x+3 y & =-11
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x+0=12 \\
& x=\frac{12}{6}=2
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=2$ into equation (3) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
5(2)+3 y & =1 \\
10+3 y & =1 \\
3 y=1-10 & =-9 \\
y=\frac{-9}{3} & =-3
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, substituting $x=2, y=-3$ in equation (4) gives
$$\text { LHS }=-2+3(-3)=-2-9=-11=\text { RHS }$$

Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{- 3}$.

\subsection*{13.5 Practical problems involving simultaneous equations}

There are a number of situations in engineering and science in which the solution of simultaneous equations is required. Some are demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Problem 12. The law connecting friction $F$ and load $L$ for an experiment is of the form $F=a L+b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. When $F=5.6 \mathrm{~N}$, $L=8.0 \mathrm{~N}$ and when $F=4.4 N, L=2.0 \mathrm{~N}$. Find the values of $a$ and $b$ and the value of $F$ when $L=6.5 \mathrm{~N}$

Substituting $F=5.6$ and $L=8.0$ into $F=a L+b$ gives
$$5.6=8.0 a+b$$

Substituting $F=4.4$ and $L=2.0$ into $F=a L+b$ gives
$$4.4=2.0 a+b$$

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
1.2 & =6.0 a \\
\boldsymbol{a} & =\frac{1.2}{6.0}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{5}} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 2}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $a=\frac{1}{5}$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{gathered}
5.6=8.0\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)+b \\
5.6=1.6+b \\
5.6-1.6=b \\
\quad \boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{4}
\end{gathered}$$
i.e.

Checking, substituting $a=\frac{1}{5}$ and $b=4$ in equation (2), gives
$$\mathrm{RHS}=2.0\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)+4=0.4+4=4.4=\mathrm{LHS}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{5}}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{4}$
When $L=6.5, F=a L+b=\frac{1}{5}(6.5)+4=1.3+4$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{F}=\mathbf{5 . 3 0} \mathrm{N}$.

Problem 13. The equation of a straight line, of gradient $m$ and intercept on the $y$-axis $c$, is $y=m x+c$. If a straight line passes through the point where $x=1$ and $y=-2$, and also through the point where $x=3.5$ and $y=10.5$, find the values of the gradient and the $y$-axis intercept

Substituting $x=1$ and $y=-2$ into $y=m x+c$ gives
$$-2=m+c$$

Substituting $x=3.5$ and $y=10.5$ into $y=m x+c$ gives
$$10.5=3.5 m+c$$

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives
$$12.5=2.5 m, \quad \text { from which, } \quad \boldsymbol{m}=\frac{12.5}{2.5}=\mathbf{5}$$

Substituting $m=5$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
-2 & =5+c \\
\boldsymbol{c} & =-2-5=-7
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, substituting $m=5$ and $c=-7$ in equation (2), gives
$$\text { RHS }=(3.5)(5)+(-7)=17.5-7=10.5=\text { LHS }$$

Hence, the gradient $\boldsymbol{m}=5$ and the $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $c=-7$.

Problem 14. When Kirchhoff's laws are applied to the electrical circuit shown in Figure 13.1, the currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are connected by the equations
$$\begin{aligned}
27 & =1.5 I_{1}+8\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \\
-26 & =2 I_{2}-8\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Figure 13.1
Solve the equations to find the values of currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$

Removing the brackets from equation (1) gives
$$27=1.5 I_{1}+8 I_{1}-8 I_{2}$$

Rearranging gives
$$9.5 I_{1}-8 I_{2}=27$$

Removing the brackets from equation (2) gives
$$-26=2 I_{2}-8 I_{1}+8 I_{2}$$

Rearranging gives
$$-8 I_{1}+10 I_{2}=-26$$

Multiplying equation (3) by 5 gives
$$47.5 I_{1}-40 I_{2}=135$$

Multiplying equation (4) by 4 gives
$$-32 I_{1}+40 I_{2}=-104$$

Adding equations (5) and (6) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 15.5 I_{1}+0=31 \\
& \boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{1}}=\frac{31}{15.5}=\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $I_{1}=2$ into equation (3) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
9.5(2)-8 I_{1} & =27 \\
19-8 I_{2} & =27 \\
19-27 & =8 I_{2} \\
-8 & =8 I_{2} \\
\boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{2}} & =\mathbf{1}
\end{aligned}$$
and

Hence, the solution is $\boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{1}}=\mathbf{2}$ and $\boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{2}}=\mathbf{- 1}$ (which may be checked in the original equations).

Problem 15. The distance $s$ metres from a fixed point of a vehicle travelling in a straight line with constant acceleration, $a \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, is given by $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$, where $u$ is the initial velocity in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $t$ the time in seconds. Determine the initial velocity and the acceleration given that $s=42 \mathrm{~m}$ when $t=2 \mathrm{~s}$, and $s=144 \mathrm{~m}$ when $t=4 \mathrm{~s}$. Also find the distance travelled after 3 s

Substituting $s=42$ and $t=2$ into $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 42=2 u+\frac{1}{2} a(2)^{2} \\
& 42=2 u+2 a
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $s=144$ and $t=4$ into $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
144 & =4 u+\frac{1}{2} a(4)^{2} \\
144 & =4 u+8 a
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation (1) by 2 gives
$$84=4 u+4 a$$

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
60 & =0+4 a \\
\boldsymbol{a} & =\frac{60}{4}=\mathbf{1 5}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $a=15$ into equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
42 & =2 u+2(15) \\
42-30 & =2 u \\
\boldsymbol{u} & =\frac{12}{2}=\mathbf{6}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting $a=15$ and $u=6$ in equation (2) gives
$$\text { RHS }=4(6)+8(15)=24+120=144=\mathrm{LHS}$$

Hence, the initial velocity $u=\mathbf{6 m} / \mathrm{s}$ and the acceleration $a=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
Distance travelled after 3 s is given by $s=u t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ where $t=3, u=6$ and $a=15$.
Hence, $s=(6)(3)+\frac{1}{2}(15)(3)^{2}=18+67.5$
i.e. distance travelled after $\mathbf{3 s}=85.5 \mathrm{~m}$.

Problem 16. The resistance $R \Omega$ of a length of wire at $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by $R=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$, where $R_{0}$ is the resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance in $/{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the values of $\alpha$ and $R_{0}$ if $R=30 \Omega$ at $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $R=35 \Omega$ at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

Substituting $R=30$ and $t=50$ into $R=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$ gives
$$30=R_{0}(1+50 \alpha)$$

Substituting $R=35$ and $t=100$ into $R=R_{0}(1+\alpha t)$ gives
$$35=R_{0}(1+100 \alpha)$$

Although these equations may be solved by the conventional substitution method, an easier way is to eliminate $R_{0}$ by division. Thus, dividing equation (1) by equation (2) gives
$$\frac{30}{35}=\frac{R_{0}(1+50 \alpha)}{R_{0}(1+100 \alpha)}=\frac{1+50 \alpha}{1+100 \alpha}$$

Cross-multiplying gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
& 30(1+100 \alpha)=35(1+50 \alpha) \\
& 30+3000 \alpha=35+1750 \alpha \\
& 3000 \alpha-1750 \alpha=35-30 \\
& 1250 \alpha=5 \\
& \text { i.e. } \quad \begin{aligned}
\alpha & =\frac{5}{1250}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2 5 0}} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 0 0 4}
\end{aligned} \\
& \text { Substituting } \alpha=\frac{1}{250} \text { into equation (1) gives } \\
& 30=R_{0}\left\{1+(50)\left(\frac{1}{250}\right)\right\} \\
& 30=R_{0}(1.2) \\
& \boldsymbol{R}_{\mathbf{0}}=\frac{30}{1.2}=\mathbf{2 5}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

Checking, substituting $\alpha=\frac{1}{250}$ and $R_{0}=25$ in equation (2), gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { RHS } & =25\left\{1+(100)\left(\frac{1}{250}\right)\right\} \\
& =25(1.4)=35=\mathrm{LHS}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the solution is $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 4} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathbf{0}}=\mathbf{2 5} \boldsymbol{\Omega}$.

Problem 17. The molar heat capacity of a solid compound is given by the equation $c=a+b T$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. When $c=52, T=100$ and when $c=172, T=400$. Determine the values of $a$ and $b$

When $c=52, \quad T=100$, hence
$$52=a+100 b$$

When $c=172, \quad T=400$, hence
$$172=a+400 b$$

Equation (2) - equation (1) gives
$$120=300 b$$
from which, $\quad \boldsymbol{b}=\frac{120}{300}=\mathbf{0 . 4}$
Substituting $b=0.4$ in equation (1) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
52 & =a+100(0.4) \\
\boldsymbol{a} & =52-40=\mathbf{1 2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{1 2}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0} .4$

Solve for $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$

\subsection*{13.6 Solving simultaneous equations in three unknowns}

Equations containing three unknowns may be solved using exactly the same procedures as those used with two equations and two unknowns, providing that there are three equations to work with. The method is demonstrated in the following worked problem.

Problem 18. Solve the simultaneous equations.
$$\begin{aligned}
x+y+z & =4 \\
2 x-3 y+4 z & =33 \\
3 x-2 y-2 z & =2
\end{aligned}$$

There are a number of ways of solving these equations. One method is shown below.
The initial object is to produce two equations with two unknowns. For example, multiplying equation (1) by 4 and then subtracting this new equation from equation (2) will produce an equation with only $x$ and $y$ involved.

Multiplying equation (1) by 4 gives
$$4 x+4 y+4 z=16$$

Equation (2) - equation (4) gives
$$-2 x-7 y=17$$

Similarly, multiplying equation (3) by 2 and then adding this new equation to equation (2) will produce another equation with only $x$ and $y$ involved.

Multiplying equation (3) by 2 gives
$$6 x-4 y-4 z=4$$

Equation (2) + equation (6) gives
$$8 x-7 y=37$$

Rewriting equation (5) gives
$$-2 x-7 y=17$$

Now we can use the previous method for solving simultaneous equations in two unknowns.

Equation (7) - equation (5) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
10 x & =20 \\
\boldsymbol{x} & =\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$
from which,
(Note that $8 x--2 x=8 x+2 x=10 x$ )
Substituting $x=2$ into equation (5) gives
$$-4-7 y=17$$
from which, $\quad-7 y=17+4=21$
and
$$y=-3$$

Substituting $x=2$ and $y=-3$ into equation (1) gives
$$2-3+z=4$$
from which,
$$z=5$$

Hence, the solution of the simultaneous equations is $x=2, y=-3$ and $z=5$.

\section*{Solving quadratic equations}

\subsection*{14.1 Introduction}

As stated in Chapter 11, an equation is a statement that two quantities are equal and to 'solve an equation' means 'to find the value of the unknown'. The value of the unknown is called the root of the equation.
A quadratic equation is one in which the highest power of the unknown quantity is 2 . For example, $x^{2}-3 x+1=0$ is a quadratic equation.
There are four methods of solving quadratic equations. These are:
(a) by factorization (where possible),
(b) by 'completing the square',
(c) by using the 'quadratic formula', or
(d) graphically (see Chapter 19).

\subsection*{14.2 Solution of quadratic equations by factorization}

Multiplying out $(x+1)(x-3)$ gives $x^{2}-3 x+x-3$ i.e. $x^{2}-2 x-3$. The reverse process of moving from $x^{2}-2 x-3$ to $(x+1)(x-3)$ is called factorizing.
If the quadratic expression can be factorized this provides the simplest method of solving a quadratic equation.
For example, if $x^{2}-2 x-3=0$, then, by factorizing
$$(x+1)(x-3)=0$$

Hence, either $\quad(x+1)=0$, i.e. $x=-1$
or $\quad(x-3)=0$, i.e. $x=3$
Hence, $x=-1$ and $x=3$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^{2}-2 x-3=0$.
The technique of factorizing is often one of trial and error.

\section*{Problem 1. Solve the equation $x^{2}+x-6=0$ by factorization}

The factors of $x^{2}$ are $x$ and $x$. These are placed in brackets: $\quad(x \quad)(x \quad)$
The factors of -6 are +6 and -1 , or -6 and +1 , or +3 and -2 , or -3 and +2 .
The only combination to give a middle term of $+x$ is +3 and -2 ,
i.e.
$$x^{2}+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)$$

The quadratic equation $x^{2}+x-6=0$ thus becomes
$$(x+3)(x-2)=0$$

Since the only way that this can be true is for either the first or the second or both factors to be zero, then
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { either } & (x+3)=0, \text { i.e. } x=-3 \\
\text { or } & (x-2)=0, \text { i.e. } x=2
\end{array}$$

Hence, the roots of $x^{2}+x-6=0$ are $x=-3$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=2$.

Problem 2. Solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ by factorization

The factors of $x^{2}$ are $x$ and $x$. These are placed in brackets: $\quad(x \quad)(x \quad)$
The factors of -8 are +8 and -1 , or -8 and +1 , or +4 and -2 , or -4 and +2 .
The only combination to give a middle term of $+2 x$ is +4 and -2 ,
i.e.
$$x^{2}+2 x-8=(x+4)(x-2)$$
(Note that the product of the two inner terms ( $4 x$ ) added to the product of the two outer terms $(-2 x)$ must equal the middle term, $+2 x$ in this case.)

The quadratic equation $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ thus becomes $(x+4)(x-2)=0$
Since the only way that this can be true is for either the first or the second or both factors to be zero,
either
$$\begin{array}{lll}
(x+4)=0, & \text { i.e. } & x=-4 \\
(x-2)=0, & \text { i.e. } & x=2
\end{array}$$
or
Hence, the roots of $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.

Problem 3. Determine the roots of $x^{2}-6 x+9=0$ by factorization
$x^{2}-6 x+9=(x-3)(x-3), \quad$ i.e. $(x-3)^{2}=0$
The LHS is known as a perfect square.
Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$ is the only root of the equation $x^{2}-6 x+9=0$.

Problem 4. Solve the equation $x^{2}-4 x=0$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Factorizing gives } \quad x(x-4)=0 \\
& \text { If } \\
& x(x-4)=0, \\
& \text { either } \\
& x=0 \quad \text { or } \quad x-4=0 \\
& \text { i.e. } \\
& \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{0} \text { or } \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{4}
\end{aligned}$$

These are the two roots of the given equation. Answers can always be checked by substitution into the original equation.

Problem 5. Solve the equation $x^{2}+3 x-4=0$
Factorizing gives
$$(x-1)(x+4)=0$$

Hence, either
$$\begin{array}{rll}
x-1=0 & \text { or } & x+4=0 \\
\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{1} & \text { or } & \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 4}
\end{array}$$
i.e.

Problem 6. Determine the roots of $4 x^{2}-25=0$ by factorization

The LHS of $4 x^{2}-25=0$ is the difference of two squares, $(2 x)^{2}$ and $(5)^{2}$.
By factorizing, $4 x^{2}-25=(2 x+5)(2 x-5)$, i.e. $(2 x+5)(2 x-5)=0$

Hence, either
$$(2 x+5)=0, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad x=-\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{2}}=-\mathbf{2 . 5}$$
or
$$(2 x-5)=0, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad \boldsymbol{x}=\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{2}}=\mathbf{2 . 5}$$

Problem 7. Solve the equation $x^{2}-5 x+6=0$

Factorizing gives
Hence, either i.e.
$$(x-3)(x-2)=0$$
$$x-3=0 \quad \text { or } x-2=0$$
$$x=\mathbf{3} \text { or } x=\mathbf{2}$$

Problem 8. Solve the equation $x^{2}=15-2 x$
Rearranging gives
$$x^{2}+2 x-15=0$$

Factorizing gives
$$(x+5)(x-3)=0$$

Hence, either
i.e.
$$x+5=0 \quad \text { or } \quad x-3=0$$
$$\boldsymbol{x}=-\mathbf{5} \text { or } \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$$

Problem 9. Solve the equation $3 x^{2}-11 x-4=0$ by factorization

The factors of $3 x^{2}$ are $3 x$ and $x$. These are placed in brackets: $(3 x \quad)(x \quad)$
The factors of -4 are -4 and +1 , or +4 and -1 , or -2 and 2.
Remembering that the product of the two inner terms added to the product of the two outer terms must equal $-11 x$, the only combination to give this is +1 and -4 ,
i.e.
$$3 x^{2}-11 x-4=(3 x+1)(x-4)$$

The quadratic equation $3 x^{2}-11 x-4=0$ thus becomes
$$(3 x+1)(x-4)=0$$

Hence, either $(3 x+1)=0$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}=-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}$
or
$$(x-4)=0, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad x=4$$
and both solutions may be checked in the original equation.

Problem 10. Solve the quadratic equation $4 x^{2}+8 x+3=0$ by factorizing

The factors of $4 x^{2}$ are $4 x$ and $x$ or $2 x$ and $2 x$.
The factors of 3 are 3 and 1 , or -3 and -1 .
Remembering that the product of the inner terms added to the product of the two outer terms must equal $+8 x$, the only combination that is true (by trial and error) is
$$\left(4 x^{2}+8 x+3\right)=(2 x+3)(2 x+1)$$

Hence, $(2 x+3)(2 x+1)=0$, from which either $(2 x+3)=0$ or $(2 x+1)=0$.

Thus, $2 x=-3$, from which $\boldsymbol{x}=-\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{2}}$ or $\mathbf{- 1 . 5}$ or $\quad 2 x=-1$, from which $\boldsymbol{x}=-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}$ or $-\mathbf{0 . 5}$ which may be checked in the original equation.

Problem 11. Solve the quadratic equation $15 x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ by factorizing

The factors of $15 x^{2}$ are $15 x$ and $x$ or $5 x$ and $3 x$.
The factors of -8 are -4 are +2 , or 4 and -2 , or -8 and +1 , or 8 and -1 .
By trial and error the only combination that works is
$$15 x^{2}+2 x-8=(5 x+4)(3 x-2)$$

Hence, $(5 x+4)(3 x-2)=0$, from which either $5 x+$ $4=0$ or $3 x-2=0$.
Hence, $x=-\frac{\mathbf{4}}{\mathbf{5}} \quad$ or $\quad x=\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{3}}$
which may be checked in the original equation.
Problem 12. The roots of a quadratic equation are $\frac{1}{3}$ and -2 . Determine the equation in $x$

If the roots of a quadratic equation are, say, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, then $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)=0$.

Hence, if $\alpha=\frac{1}{3}$ and $\beta=-2$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)(x-(-2)) & =0 \\
\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)(x+2) & =0 \\
x^{2}-\frac{1}{3} x+2 x-\frac{2}{3} & =0 \\
x^{2}+\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{3}} x-\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{3}} & =0 \\
3 x^{2}+\mathbf{5}-\mathbf{2} & =0
\end{aligned}$$
or

Problem 13. Find the equation in $x$ whose roots are 5 and -5

If 5 and -5 are the roots of a quadratic equation then
$$(x-5)(x+5)=0$$
i.e.
i.e.
$$\begin{array}{r}
x^{2}-5 x+5 x-25=0 \\
\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{2 5}=\mathbf{0}
\end{array}$$

Problem 14. Find the equation in $x$ whose roots are 1.2 and -0.4

If 1.2 and -0.4 are the roots of a quadratic equation then
i.e.
$$x^{2}-1.2 x+0.4 x-0.48=0$$
i.e.
$$x^{2}-0.8 x-0.48=0$$

\subsection*{14.3 Solution of quadratic equations by 'completing the square'}

An expression such as $x^{2}$ or $(x+2)^{2}$ or $(x-3)^{2}$ is called a perfect square.
If $x^{2}=3$ then $x= \pm \sqrt{3}$
If $(x+2)^{2}=5$ then $x+2= \pm \sqrt{5}$ and $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{5}$
If $(x-3)^{2}=8$ then $x-3= \pm \sqrt{8}$ and $x=3 \pm \sqrt{8}$
Hence, if a quadratic equation can be rearranged so that one side of the equation is a perfect square and the other side of the equation is a number, then the solution of the equation is readily obtained by taking the square roots of each side as in the above examples. The process of rearranging one side of a quadratic equation into a perfect square before solving is called 'completing the square'.
$$(x+a)^{2}=x^{2}+2 a x+a^{2}$$

Thus, in order to make the quadratic expression $x^{2}+2 a x$ into a perfect square, it is necessary to add (half the coefficient of $x)^{2}$, i.e. $\left(\frac{2 a}{2}\right)^{2}$ or $a^{2}$
For example, $x^{2}+3 x$ becomes a perfect square by adding $\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}$, i.e.
$$x^{2}+3 x+\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(x+\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}$$

The method of completing the square is demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Problem 15. Solve $2 x^{2}+5 x=3$ by completing the square

The procedure is as follows.
(i) Rearrange the equation so that all terms are on the same side of the equals sign (and the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term is positive). Hence,
$$2 x^{2}+5 x-3=0$$
(ii) Make the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term unity. In this case this is achieved by dividing throughout by 2 . Hence,
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+\frac{5 x}{2}-\frac{3}{2} & =0 \\
\text { i.e. } \quad x^{2}+\frac{5}{2} x-\frac{3}{2} & =0
\end{array}$$
(iii) Rearrange the equations so that the $x^{2}$ and $x$ terms are on one side of the equals sign and the constant is on the other side. Hence,
$$x^{2}+\frac{5}{2} x=\frac{3}{2}$$
(iv) Add to both sides of the equation (half the coefficient of $x)^{2}$. In this case the coefficient of $x$ is $\frac{5}{2}$ Half the coefficient squared is therefore $\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}$ Thus,
$$x^{2}+\frac{5}{2} x+\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{3}{2}+\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}$$

The LHS is now a perfect square, i.e.
$$\left(x+\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{3}{2}+\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}$$
(v) Evaluate the RHS. Thus,
$$\left(x+\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{25}{16}=\frac{24+25}{16}=\frac{49}{16}$$
(vi) Take the square root of both sides of the equation (remembering that the square root of a number gives a $\pm$ answer). Thus,
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{\left(x+\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}} & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{49}{16}\right)} \\
x+\frac{5}{4} & = \pm \frac{7}{4}
\end{aligned}$$
(vii) Solve the simple equation. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
& x=-\frac{5}{4} \pm \frac{7}{4} \\
\text { i.e. } & x=-\frac{5}{4}+\frac{7}{4}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2} \text { or } 0.5 \\
\text { and } \quad x & =-\frac{5}{4}-\frac{7}{4}=-\frac{12}{4}=-3
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{0 . 5}$ or $\boldsymbol{x}=-\mathbf{3}$; i.e., the roots of the equation $2 x^{2}+5 x=3$ are 0.5 and -3 .

Problem 16. Solve $2 x^{2}+9 x+8=0$, correct to 3 significant figures, by completing the square

Making the coefficient of $x^{2}$ unity gives
$$x^{2}+\frac{9}{2} x+4=0$$

Rearranging gives $\quad x^{2}+\frac{9}{2} x=-4$

Adding to both sides (half the coefficient of $x)^{2}$ gives
$$x^{2}+\frac{9}{2} x+\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^{2}-4$$

The LHS is now a perfect square. Thus,
$$\left(x+\frac{9}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{81}{16}-4=\frac{81}{16}-\frac{64}{16}=\frac{17}{16}$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
x+\frac{9}{4} & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{17}{16}\right)}= \pm 1.031 \\
x & =-\frac{9}{4} \pm 1.031
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 2 2}$ or $\mathbf{- 3 . 2 8}$, correct to 3 significant figures.

Problem 17. By completing the square, solve the quadratic equation $4.6 y^{2}+3.5 y-1.75=0$, correct to 3 decimal places
$$4.6 y^{2}+3.5 y-1.75=0$$

Making the coefficient of $y^{2}$ unity gives
$$y^{2}+\frac{3.5}{4.6} y-\frac{1.75}{4.6}=0$$
and rearranging gives
$$y^{2}+\frac{3.5}{4.6} y=\frac{1.75}{4.6}$$

Adding to both sides (half the coefficient of $y)^{2}$ gives
$$y^{2}+\frac{3.5}{4.6} y+\left(\frac{3.5}{9.2}\right)^{2}=\frac{1.75}{4.6}+\left(\frac{3.5}{9.2}\right)^{2}$$

The LHS is now a perfect square. Thus,
$$\left(y+\frac{3.5}{9.2}\right)^{2}=0.5251654$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$y+\frac{3.5}{9.2}=\sqrt{0.5251654}= \pm 0.7246830$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& y=-\frac{3.5}{9.2} \pm 0.7246830 \\
& \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{0 . 3 4 4} \text { or } \mathbf{- 1 . 1 0 5}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{14.4 Solution of quadratic equations by formula}

Let the general form of a quadratic equation be given by $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, where $a, b$ and $c$ are constants.
Dividing $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ by $a$ gives
$$x^{2}+\frac{b}{a} x+\frac{c}{a}=0$$

Rearranging gives $\quad x^{2}+\frac{b}{a} x=-\frac{c}{a}$
Adding to each side of the equation the square of half the coefficient of the term in $x$ to make the LHS a perfect square gives
$$x^{2}+\frac{b}{a} x+\left(\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}-\frac{c}{a}$$

Rearranging gives $\left(x+\frac{b}{a}\right)^{2}=\frac{b^{2}}{4 a^{2}}-\frac{c}{a}=\frac{b^{2}-4 a c}{4 a^{2}}$
Taking the square root of both sides gives
$$x+\frac{b}{2 a}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{b^{2}-4 a c}{4 a^{2}}\right)}=\frac{ \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$$

Hence, $\quad x=-\frac{b}{2 a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$
i.e. the quadratic formula is $\quad x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$
(This method of obtaining the formula is completing the square - as shown in the previous section.)
In summary,
if $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ then $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$
This is known as the quadratic formula.

Problem 18. Solve $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ by using the quadratic formula

Comparing $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ with $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ gives $a=1, b=2$ and $c=-8$.
Substituting these values into the quadratic formula
$$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$$
gives
$$\begin{aligned}
x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)} & =\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4+32}}{2} \\
& =\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm 6}{2} \\
& =\frac{-2+6}{2} \text { or } \frac{-2-6}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\frac{4}{2}$ or $\frac{-8}{2}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2}$ or $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 4}$.
Problem 19. Solve $3 x^{2}-11 x-4=0$ by using the quadratic formula

Comparing $3 x^{2}-11 x-4=0$ with $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ gives $a=3, b=-11$ and $c=-4$. Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-(-11) \pm \sqrt{(-11)^{2}-4(3)(-4)}}{2(3)} \\
& =\frac{+11 \pm \sqrt{121+48}}{6}=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{169}}{6} \\
& =\frac{11 \pm 13}{6}=\frac{11+13}{6} \text { or } \frac{11-13}{6}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $x=\frac{24}{6}$ or $\frac{-2}{6}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{4}$ or $\boldsymbol{x}=-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}$
Problem 20. Solve $4 x^{2}+7 x+2=0$ giving the roots correct to 2 decimal places

Comparing $4 x^{2}+7 x+2=0$ with $a x^{2}+b x+c$ gives $a=4, b=7$ and $c=2$. Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{7^{2}-4(4)(2)}}{2(4)} \\
& =\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{17}}{8}=\frac{-7 \pm 4.123}{8} \\
& =\frac{-7+4.123}{8} \text { or } \frac{-7-4.123}{8}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 0 . 3 6}$ or $\mathbf{- 1 . 3 9}$, correct to 2 decimal places.

Problem 21. Use the quadratic formula to solve $\frac{x+2}{4}+\frac{3}{x-1}=7$ correct to 4 significant figures

Multiplying throughout by $4(x-1)$ gives
$$4(x-1) \frac{(x+2)}{4}+4(x-1) \frac{3}{(x-1)}=4(x-1)(7)$$

Cancelling gives $(x-1)(x+2)+(4)(3)=28(x-1)$
$$x^{2}+x-2+12=28 x-28$$

Hence,
$$x^{2}-27 x+38=0$$

Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-(-27) \pm \sqrt{(-27)^{2}-4(1)(38)}}{2} \\
& =\frac{27 \pm \sqrt{577}}{2}=\frac{27 \pm 24.0208}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad x=\frac{27+24.0208}{2}=25.5104$
or
$$x=\frac{27-24.0208}{2}=1.4896$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2 5 . 5 1}$ or $\mathbf{1 . 4 9 0}$, correct to 4 significant figures.

\subsection*{14.5 Practical problems involving quadratic equations}

There are many practical problems in which a quadratic equation has first to be obtained, from given information, before it is solved.

Problem 22. The area of a rectangle is $23.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and its width is 3.10 cm shorter than its length. Determine the dimensions of the rectangle, correct to 3 significant figures

Let the length of the rectangle be $x \mathrm{~cm}$. Then the width is $(x-3.10) \mathrm{cm}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Area }=\text { length } \times \text { width }=x(x-3.10)=23.6 \\
& \text { i.e. } \quad x^{2}-3.10 x-23.6=0
\end{aligned}$$

Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
x= & \frac{-(-3.10) \pm \sqrt{(-3.10)^{2}-4(1)(-23.6)}}{2(1)} \\
=\frac{3.10 \pm \sqrt{9.61+94.4}}{2} & =\frac{3.10 \pm 10.20}{2} \\
& =\frac{13.30}{2} \text { or } \frac{-7.10}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $x=6.65 \mathrm{~cm}$ or -3.55 cm . The latter solution is neglected since length cannot be negative.
Thus, length $x=6.65 \mathrm{~cm}$ and width $=x-3.10=$ $6.65-3.10=3.55 \mathrm{~cm}$, i.e. the dimensions of the rectangle are 6.65 cm by 3.55 cm .
(Check: Area $=6.65 \times 3.55=23.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, correct to 3 significant figures.)

Problem 23. Calculate the diameter of a solid cylinder which has a height of 82.0 cm and a total surface area of $2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$

Total surface area of a cylinder
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\text { curved surface area }+2 \text { circular ends } \\
& \left.=2 \pi r h+2 \pi r^{2} \text { (where } r=\text { radius and } h=\text { height }\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Since the total surface area $=2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and the height $h=$ 82 cm or 0.82 m ,
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 2.0=2 \pi r(0.82)+2 \pi r^{2} \\
& 2 \pi r^{2}+2 \pi r(0.82)-2.0=0
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing throughout by $2 \pi$ gives $r^{2}+0.82 r-\frac{1}{\pi}=0$ Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
r= & \frac{-0.82 \pm \sqrt{(0.82)^{2}-4(1)\left(-\frac{1}{\pi}\right)}}{2(1)} \\
=\frac{-0.82 \pm \sqrt{1.94564}}{2} & =\frac{-0.82 \pm 1.39486}{2} \\
& =0.2874 \text { or }-1.1074
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the radius $r$ of the cylinder is 0.2874 m (the negative solution being neglected).

Hence, the diameter of the cylinder
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2 \times 0.2874 \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 5 7 4 8} \mathrm{m} \text { or } \mathbf{5 7 . 5} \mathbf{c m}

Problem 24. The height $s$ metres of a mass projected vertically upwards at time $t$ seconds is $s=u t-\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}$. Determine how long the mass will take after being projected to reach a height of 16 m (a) on the ascent and (b) on the descent, when $u=30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$

When height $s=16 \mathrm{~m}, \quad 16=30 t-\frac{1}{2}(9.81) t^{2}$ i.e.
$$4.905 t^{2}-30 t+16=0$$

Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{-(-30) \pm \sqrt{(-30)^{2}-4(4.905)(16)}}{2(4.905)} \\
& =\frac{30 \pm \sqrt{586.1}}{9.81}=\frac{30 \pm 24.21}{9.81}=5.53 \text { or } 0.59
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the mass will reach a height of 16 m after 0.59 s on the ascent and after 5.53 s on the descent.

Problem 25. A shed is 4.0 m long and 2.0 m wide. A concrete path of constant width is laid all the way around the shed. If the area of the path is $9.50 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, calculate its width to the nearest centimetre

Figure 14.1 shows a plan view of the shed with its surrounding path of width $t$ metres.

Figure 14.1
$$\begin{array}{lc} 
& \text { Area of path }=2(2.0 \times t)+2 t(4.0+2 t) \\
\text { i.e. } & 9.50=4.0 t+8.0 t+4 t^{2} \\
\text { or } & 4 t^{2}+12.0 t-9.50=0
\end{array}$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{-(12.0) \pm \sqrt{(12.0)^{2}-4(4)(-9.50)}}{2(4)} \\
& =\frac{-12.0 \pm \sqrt{296.0}}{8}=\frac{-12.0 \pm 17.20465}{8} \\
\text { i.e. } \quad t & =0.6506 \mathrm{~m} \text { or }-3.65058 \mathrm{~m} .
\end{aligned}$$

Neglecting the negative result, which is meaningless, the width of the path, $\boldsymbol{t}=\mathbf{0 . 6 5 1} \mathrm{m}$ or $\mathbf{6 5} \mathbf{~} \mathrm{m}$ correct to the nearest centimetre.

Problem 26. If the total surface area of a solid cone is $486.2 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and its slant height is 15.3 cm , determine its base diameter.

From Chapter 27, page 245, the total surface area $A$ of a solid cone is given by $A=\pi r l+\pi r^{2}$, where $l$ is the slant height and $r$ the base radius.

If $A=482.2$ and $l=15.3$, then $482.2=\pi r(15.3)+\pi r^{2}$
i.e.
$$\pi r^{2}+15.3 \pi r-482.2=0$$
or
$$r^{2}+15.3 r-\frac{482.2}{\pi}=0$$

Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
r & =\frac{-15.3 \pm \sqrt{\left[(15.3)^{2}-4\left(\frac{-482.2}{\pi}\right)\right]}}{2} \\
& =\frac{-15.3 \pm \sqrt{848.0461}}{2}=\frac{-15.3 \pm 29.12123}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, radius $r=6.9106 \mathrm{~cm}$ (or -22.21 cm , which is meaningless and is thus ignored).
Thus, the diameter of the base $=2 r=2(6.9106)$
$$=13.82 \mathrm{~cm}$$

\subsection*{14.6 Solution of linear and quadratic equations simultaneously}

Sometimes a linear equation and a quadratic equation need to be solved simultaneously. An algebraic method of solution is shown in Problem 27; a graphical solution is shown in Chapter 19, page 160.

Problem 27. Determine the values of $x$ and $y$ which simultaneously satisfy the equations $y=5 x-4-2 x^{2}$ and $y=6 x-7$

For a simultaneous solution the values of $y$ must be equal, hence the RHS of each equation is equated.

Thus,
$$5 x-4-2 x^{2}=6 x-7$$

Rearranging gives
$$5 x-4-2 x^{2}-6 x+7=0$$
i.e.
$$-x+3-2 x^{2}=0$$
or
$$2 x^{2}+x-3=0$$

Factorizing gives
$$(2 x+3)(x-1)=0$$
i.e.
$$x=-\frac{3}{2} \text { or } x=1$$

In the equation $y=6 x-7$,
when $x=-\frac{3}{2}, \quad y=6\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)-7=-16$
and when $x=1, \quad y=6-7=-1$
(Checking the result in $y=5 x-4-2 x^{2}$ :
when $x=-\frac{3}{2}, \quad y=5\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)-4-2\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}$
$$=-\frac{15}{2}-4-\frac{9}{2}=-16, \text { as above, }$$
and when $x=1, \quad y=5-4-2=-1$, as above.)

Hence, the simultaneous solutions occur when
$x=-\frac{3}{2}, y=-16$ and when $x=1, y=-1$.

\section*{Chapter 15}

\subsection*{15.1 Introduction to logarithms}

With the use of calculators firmly established, logarithmic tables are now rarely used for calculation. However, the theory of logarithms is important, for there are several scientific and engineering laws that involve the rules of logarithms.

From Chapter 7, we know that $\quad 16=2^{4}$.
The number 4 is called the power or the exponent or the index. In the expression $2^{4}$, the number 2 is called the base.

In another example, we know that $\quad 64=8^{2}$.
In this example, 2 is the power, or exponent, or index. The number 8 is the base.

\subsection*{15.1.1 What is a logarithm?}

Consider the expression $16=2^{4}$.
An alternative, yet equivalent, way of writing this expression is $\log _{2} 16=4$.
This is stated as 'log to the base 2 of 16 equals 4 '.
We see that the logarithm is the same as the power or index in the original expression. It is the base in the original expression that becomes the base of the logarithm.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { The two statements } 16=2^{4} \text { and } \\
& \qquad \log _{2} 16=4 \text { are equivalent }
\end{aligned}$$

If we write either of them, we are automatically implying the other.
In general, if a number $y$ can be written in the form $a^{x}$, then the index $x$ is called the 'logarithm of $y$ to the base

\section*{Logarithms}
of $a^{\prime}$, i.e.
$$\text { if } y=a^{x} \text { then } x=\log _{a} y$$

In another example, if we write down that $64=8^{2}$ then the equivalent statement using logarithms is $\log _{8} 64=2$. In another example, if we write down that $\log _{3} 27=3$ then the equivalent statement using powers is $3^{3}=27$. So the two sets of statements, one involving powers and one involving logarithms, are equivalent.

\subsection*{15.1.2 Common logarithms}

From the above, if we write down that $1000=10^{3}$, then $3=\log _{10} 1000$. This may be checked using the 'log' button on your calculator.
Logarithms having a base of 10 are called common logarithms and $\log _{10}$ is usually abbreviated to lg. The following values may be checked using a calculator.
$$\begin{aligned}
\lg 27.5 & =1.4393 \ldots \\
\lg 378.1 & =2.5776 \ldots \\
\lg 0.0204 & =-1.6903 \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{15.1.3 Napierian logarithms}

Logarithms having a base of $e$ (where $e$ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.7183 ) are called hyperbolic, Napierian or natural logarithms, and $\log _{e}$ is usually abbreviated to $\ln$. The following values may be checked using a calculator.
$$\begin{aligned}
\ln 3.65 & =1.2947 \ldots \\
\ln 417.3 & =6.0338 \ldots \\
\ln 0.182 & =-1.7037 \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

Napierian logarithms are explained further in Chapter 16, following.

Here are some worked problems to help understanding of logarithms.

Let $x=\log _{3} 9 \quad$ then $3^{x}=9$ from the definition of a logarithm,

\section*{Problem 2. Evaluate $\log _{10} 10$}

Let $x=\log _{10} 10$ then $10^{x}=10$ from the definition of a logarithm,

Hence,
$\log _{10} 10=1$ (which may be checked using a calculator).

\section*{Problem 3. Evaluate $\log _{16} 8$}

Let $x=\log _{16} 8 \quad$ then $16^{x}=8$ from the definition of a logarithm,

i.e. $2^{4 x}=2^{3}$ from the laws of indices,
from which, $\quad 4 x=3$ and $x=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{4}}$
Hence, $\quad \log _{16} 8=\frac{3}{4}$

\section*{Problem 4. Evaluate $\lg 0.001$}

Let $x=\lg 0.001=\log _{10} 0.001$ then $10^{x}=0.001$ i.e.

from which, $x=-3$
Hence,
$\lg 0.001=-3$ (which may be checked using a calculator)

\section*{Problem 5. Evaluate $\ln e$}

Let $x=\ln e=\log _{e} e$ then $e^{x}=e$
i.e.

\subsection*{15.2 Laws of logarithms}

There are three laws of logarithms, which apply to any base:
(1) To multiply two numbers:
$$\log (A \times B)=\log A+\log B$$

The following may be checked by using a calculator.
$$\lg 10=1$$

Also, $\quad \lg 5+\lg 2=0.69897 \ldots+0.301029 \ldots=1$
Hence, $\quad \lg (5 \times 2)=\lg 10=\lg 5+\lg 2$
(2) To divide two numbers:
$$\log \left(\frac{A}{B}\right)=\log A-\log B$$

The following may be checked using a calculator.
$$\ln \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)=\ln 2.5=0.91629 \ldots$$

Also,
$$\begin{aligned}
\ln 5-\ln 2 & =1.60943 \ldots-0.69314 \ldots \\
& =0.91629 \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad \ln \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)=\ln 5-\ln 2$
(3) To raise a number to a power:
$$\log \mathrm{A}^{n}=n \log \mathrm{~A}$$

The following may be checked using a calculator.
$$\lg 5^{2}=\lg 25=1.39794 \ldots$$

Also, $\quad 2 \lg 5=2 \times 0.69897 \ldots=1.39794 \ldots$
Hence, $\quad \lg 5^{2}=2 \lg 5$
Here are some worked problems to help understanding of the laws of logarithms.

$\log \left(x^{2}-3\right)-\log x=\log \left(\frac{x^{2}-3}{x}\right)$ from the second
law of logarithms
Hence, $\quad \log \left(\frac{x^{2}-3}{x}\right)=\log 2$
from which, $\quad \frac{x^{2}-3}{x}=2$
Rearranging gives $\quad x^{2}-3=2 x$
and
$$x^{2}-2 x-3=0$$

Factorizing gives $\quad(x-3)(x+1)=0$
from which,
$$x=3 \text { or } x=-1$$
$x=-1$ is not a valid solution since the logarithm of a negative number has no real root.

Hence, the solution of the equation is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$.

i.e. $\quad \log _{10} 3^{x}=\log _{10} 27$
and $\quad x \log _{10} 3=\log _{10} 27$
by the third law of logarithms
Rearranging gives $\quad x=\frac{\log _{10} 27}{\log _{10} 3}=\frac{1.43136 \ldots}{0.47712 \ldots}$
$=\mathbf{3} \quad$ which may be readily checked.
(Note, $\frac{\log 27}{\log 3}$ is not equal to $\log \frac{27}{3}$ )

Problem 22. Solve the equation $2^{x}=5$, correct to 4 significant figures

Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides of $2^{x}=5$ gives
i.e.
$$\log _{10} 2^{x}=\log _{10} 5$$
$$x \log _{10} 2=\log _{10} 5$$
by the third law of logarithms
Rearranging gives $\mathbf{x}=\frac{\log _{10} 5}{\log _{10} 2}=\frac{0.6989700 \ldots}{0.3010299 \ldots}$
$$=\mathbf{2 . 3 2 2}, \text { correct to } 4$$
significant figures.

Problem 23. Solve the equation $2^{x+1}=3^{2 x-5}$ correct to 2 decimal places

Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives
$$\log _{10} 2^{x+1}=\log _{10} 3^{2 x-5}$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
(x+1) \log _{10} 2 & =(2 x-5) \log _{10} 3 \\
x \log _{10} 2+\log _{10} 2 & =2 x \log _{10} 3-5 \log _{10} 3 \\
x(0.3010)+(0.3010) & =2 x(0.4771)-5(0.4771)
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
$$0.3010 x+0.3010=0.9542 x-2.3855$$

Hence,
$$2.3855+0.3010=0.9542 x-0.3010 x$$
$$2.6865=0.6532 x$$
from which
$$x=\frac{2.6865}{0.6532}=4.11$$
correct to 2 decimal places.

Problem 24. Solve the equation $x^{2.7}=34.68$, correct to 4 significant figures

Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\log _{10} x^{2.7} & =\log _{10} 34.68 \\
2.7 \log _{10} x & =\log _{10} 34.68
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$\log _{10} x=\frac{\log _{10} 34.68}{2.7}=0.57040$$

Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x} & =\operatorname{antilog} 0.57040=10^{0.57040} \\
& =\mathbf{3 . 7 1 9}
\end{aligned}$$
correct to 4 significant figures.

\subsection*{15.4 Graphs of logarithmic functions}

A graph of $y=\log _{10} x$ is shown in Figure 15.1 and a graph of $y=\log _{e} x$ is shown in Figure 15.2. Both can be seen to be of similar shape; in fact, the same general shape occurs for a logarithm to any base.
In general, with a logarithm to any base, $a$, it is noted that
(a) $\log _{a} 1=0$

Let $\log _{a}=x$ then $a^{x}=1$ from the definition of the logarithm.
If $a^{x}=1$ then $x=0$ from the laws of logarithms.
Hence, $\log _{\boldsymbol{a}} \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{0}$. In the above graphs it is seen that $\log _{10} 1=0$ and $\log _{e} 1=0$.
(b) $\log _{a} a=1$

Let $\log _{a} a=x$ then $a^{x}=a$ from the definition of a logarithm.
If $a^{x}=a$ then $x=1$.

Figure 15.1

Hence, $\log _{a} a=1$. (Check with a calculator that $\log _{10} 10=1$ and $\log _{e} e=1$.)
(c) $\log _{a} 0 \rightarrow-\infty$

Let $\log _{a} 0=x$ then $a^{x}=0$ from the definition of a logarithm.

Figure 15.2

If $a^{x}=0$, and a is a positive real number, then $x$ must approach minus infinity. (For example, check with a calculator, $2^{-2}=0.25,2^{-20}=$ $9.54 \times 10^{-7}, 2^{-200}=6.22 \times 10^{-61}$, and so on.) Hence, $\log _{\boldsymbol{a}} \mathbf{0} \rightarrow-\infty$

\section*{Exponential functions}

\subsection*{16.1 Introduction to exponential functions}

An exponential function is one which contains $e^{x}, e$ being a constant called the exponent and having an approximate value of 2.7183 . The exponent arises from the natural laws of growth and decay and is used as a base for natural or Napierian logarithms.
The most common method of evaluating an exponential function is by using a scientific notation calculator. Use your calculator to check the following values.
$e^{1}=2.7182818$, correct to 8 significant figures, $e^{-1.618}=0.1982949$, correct to 7 significant figures, $e^{0.12}=1.1275$, correct to 5 significant figures, $e^{-1.47}=0.22993$, correct to 5 decimal places, $e^{-0.431}=0.6499$, correct to 4 decimal places, $e^{9.32}=11159$, correct to 5 significant figures, $e^{-2.785}=0.0617291$, correct to 7 decimal places.

$$\begin{aligned}

& \quad=5\left(\frac{1.28402541 \ldots-0.77880078 \ldots}{1.28402541 \ldots+0.77880078 \ldots}\right) \\

\subsection*{16.2 The power series for $e^{x}$}

The value of $e^{x}$ can be calculated to any required degree of accuracy since it is defined in terms of the following power series:
$$e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\cdots$$
(where $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1$ and is called 'factorial 3 '). The series is valid for all values of $x$.
The series is said to converge; i.e., if all the terms are added, an actual value for $e^{x}$ (where $x$ is a real number) is obtained. The more terms that are taken, the closer will be the value of $e^{x}$ to its actual value. The value of the exponent $e$, correct to say 4 decimal places, may be determined by substituting $x=1$ in the power series of equation (1). Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
& e^{1}=1+1+\frac{(1)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(1)^{3}}{3!}+\frac{(1)^{4}}{4!}+\frac{(1)^{5}}{5!}+\frac{(1)^{6}}{6!} \\
&+\frac{(1)^{7}}{7!}+\frac{(1)^{8}}{8!}+\cdots \\
&=1+1+0.5+0.16667+0.04167+0.00833 \\
&+0.00139+0.00020+0.00002+\cdots
\end{aligned}$$
$$=2.71828$$
i.e. $\quad \boldsymbol{e}=\mathbf{2 . 7 1 8 3}$, correct to 4 decimal places.

The value of $e^{0.05}$, correct to say 8 significant figures, is found by substituting $x=0.05$ in the power series for $e^{x}$. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
e^{0.05}= & 1+0.05+\frac{(0.05)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(0.05)^{3}}{3!}+\frac{(0.05)^{4}}{4!} \\
& +\frac{(0.05)^{5}}{5!}+\cdots \\
= & 1+0.05+0.00125+0.000020833 \\
& +0.000000260+0.0000000026
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\boldsymbol{e}^{\mathbf{0 . 0 5}}=\mathbf{1 . 0 5 1 2 7 1 1}$, correct to 8 significant figures.

In this example, successive terms in the series grow smaller very rapidly and it is relatively easy to determine the value of $e^{0.05}$ to a high degree of accuracy. However, when $\boldsymbol{x}$ is nearer to unity or larger than unity, a very large number of terms are required for an accurate result.
If, in the series of equation (1), $x$ is replaced by $-x$, then
$$e^{-x}=1+(-x)+\frac{(-x)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(-x)^{3}}{3!}+\cdots$$
i.e. $\quad e^{-x}=1-x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\cdots$

In a similar manner the power series for $e^{x}$ may be used to evaluate any exponential function of the form $a e^{k x}$, where $a$ and $k$ are constants.
In the series of equation (1), let $x$ be replaced by $k x$. Then
$$a e^{k x}=a\left\{1+(k x)+\frac{(k x)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(k x)^{3}}{3!}+\cdots\right\}$$

Thus, $\quad 5 e^{2 x}=5\left\{1+(2 x)+\frac{(2 x)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(2 x)^{3}}{3!}+\cdots\right\}$
$$=5\left\{1+2 x+\frac{4 x^{2}}{2}+\frac{8 x^{3}}{6}+\cdots\right\}$$
i.e. $\quad 5 e^{2 x}=5\left\{1+2 x+2 x^{2}+\frac{4}{3} x^{3}+\cdots\right\}$

Problem 4. Determine the value of $5 e^{0.5}$, correct to 5 significant figures, by using the power series for $e^{x}$

From equation (1),
$$e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\cdots$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
e^{0.5}= & 1+0.5+\frac{(0.5)^{2}}{(2)(1)}+\frac{(0.5)^{3}}{(3)(2)(1)} \\
& +\frac{(0.5)^{4}}{(4)(3)(2)(1)}+\frac{(0.5)^{5}}{(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)} \\
& +\frac{(0.5)^{6}}{(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)} \\
= & 1+0.5+0.125+0.020833 \\
& +0.0026042+0.0002604 \\
& +0.0000217
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
$$e^{0.5}=1.64872, \text { correct to } 6 \text { significant } \quad \text { figures }$$

Hence,
$$5 \boldsymbol{e}^{0.5}=5(1.64872)=8.2436, \text { correct to } 5$$ significant figures.

Problem 5. Determine the value of $3 e^{-1}$, correct to 4 decimal places, using the power series for $e^{x}$

Substituting $x=-1$ in the power series
$$e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\cdots$$
gives
$$\begin{aligned}
e^{-1}= & 1+(-1)+\frac{(-1)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(-1)^{3}}{3!} \\
& \quad+\frac{(-1)^{4}}{4!}+\cdots \\
= & 1-1+0.5-0.166667+0.041667 \\
& -0.008333+0.001389 \\
& -0.000198+\cdots \\
= & 0.367858 \text { correct to } 6 \text { decimal places }
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{e}^{\mathbf{1}}=(3)(0.367858)=\mathbf{1 . 1 0 3 6}$, correct to 4 decimal places.

Problem 6. Expand $e^{x}\left(x^{2}-1\right)$ as far as the term in $x^{5}$

The power series for $e^{x}$ is
$$e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+\cdots$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& e^{x}\left(x^{2}-1\right) \\
&=\left(1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+\cdots\right)\left(x^{2}-1\right) \\
&=\left(x^{2}+x^{3}+\frac{x^{4}}{2!}+\frac{x^{5}}{3!}+\cdots\right) \\
&-\left(1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+\cdots\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Grouping like terms gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& e^{x}\left(x^{2}-1\right) \\
&=-1-x+\left(x^{2}-\frac{x^{2}}{2!}\right)+\left(x^{3}-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}\right) \\
&+\left(\frac{x^{4}}{2!}-\frac{x^{4}}{4!}\right)+\left(\frac{x^{5}}{3!}-\frac{x^{5}}{5!}\right)+\cdots \\
&=-\mathbf{1}-\boldsymbol{x}+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}+\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{6}} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{3}}+\frac{\mathbf{1 1}}{\mathbf{2 4}} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{4}}+\frac{\mathbf{1 9}}{\mathbf{1 2 0}} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{5}}
\end{aligned}$$
when expanded as far as the term in $x^{5}$.

\subsection*{16.4 Napierian logarithms}

Logarithms having a base of $e$ are called hyperbolic, Napierian or natural logarithms and the Napierian logarithm of $x$ is written as $\log _{e} x$ or, more commonly, as $\ln x$. Logarithms were invented by John Napier, a Scotsman (1550-1617).
The most common method of evaluating a Napierian logarithm is by a scientific notation calculator. Use your calculator to check the following values:
$\ln 4.328=1.46510554 \ldots=1.4651$, correct to 4 decimal places
$\ln 1.812=0.59443$, correct to 5 significant figures
$\ln 1=0$
$\ln 527=6.2672$, correct to 5 significant figures
$\ln 0.17=-1.772$, correct to 4 significant figures
$\ln 0.00042=-7.77526$, correct to 6 significant figures
$$\begin{aligned}
& \ln e^{3}=3 \\
& \ln e^{1}=1
\end{aligned}$$

From the last two examples we can conclude that
$$\log _{e} e^{x}=x$$

This is useful when solving equations involving exponential functions. For example, to solve $e^{3 x}=7$, take Napierian logarithms of both sides, which gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& \ln e^{3 x}=\ln 7 \\

(b) $\frac{\ln 7.8693}{7.8693}$
(c) $\frac{3.17 \ln 24.07}{e^{-0.1762}}$
(a) $\frac{1}{2} \ln 4.7291=\frac{1}{2}(1.5537349 \ldots)=\mathbf{0 . 7 7 6 8 7}$, correct to 5 significant figures.
(b) $\frac{\ln 7.8693}{7.8693}=\frac{2.06296911 \ldots}{7.8693}=\mathbf{0 . 2 6 2 1 5}$, correct to 5 significant figures.
(c) $\frac{3.17 \ln 24.07}{e^{-0.1762}}=\frac{3.17(3.18096625 \ldots)}{0.83845027 \ldots}=\mathbf{1 2 . 0 2 7}$, correct to 5 significant figures.

(b) $\frac{5 e^{2.23} \lg 2.23}{\ln 2.23}$ (correct to 3 decimal places)

(b) $\frac{5 e^{2.23} \lg 2.23}{\ln 2.23}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{5(9.29986607 \ldots)(0.34830486 \ldots)}{(0.80200158 \ldots)} \\
& =\mathbf{2 0 . 1 9 4}, \text { correct to } 3 \text { decimal places. }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 12. Solve the equation $9=4 e^{-3 x}$ to find $x$, correct to 4 significant figures

Rearranging $9=4 e^{-3 x}$ gives $\frac{9}{4}=e^{-3 x}$
Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives
$$\frac{4}{9}=\frac{1}{e^{-3 x}}=e^{3 x}$$

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides gives
$$\ln \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)=\ln \left(e^{3 x}\right)$$

Since $\log _{e} e^{\alpha}=\alpha$, then $\ln \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)=3 x$
Hence, $\quad \boldsymbol{x}=\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)=\frac{1}{3}(-0.81093)=\mathbf{- 0 . 2 7 0 3}$, correct to 4 significant figures.

Problem 13. Given $32=70\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\right)$, determine the value of $t$, correct to 3 significant figures

Rearranging $32=70\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\right)$ gives
$$\frac{32}{70}=1-e^{-\frac{t}{2}}$$
and
$$e^{-\frac{t}{2}}=1-\frac{32}{70}=\frac{38}{70}$$

Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives
$$e^{\frac{t}{2}}=\frac{70}{38}$$

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\ln e^{\frac{t}{2}} & =\ln \left(\frac{70}{38}\right) \\
\frac{t}{2} & =\ln \left(\frac{70}{38}\right)
\end{aligned}$$
from which, $\boldsymbol{t}=2 \ln \left(\frac{70}{38}\right)=\mathbf{1 . 2 2}$, correct to 3 significant figures.

Problem 14. Solve the equation
$$2.68=\ln \left(\frac{4.87}{x}\right) \text { to find } x$$

From the definition of a logarithm, since $2.68=\ln \left(\frac{4.87}{x}\right)$ then $e^{2.68}=\frac{4.87}{x}$
Rearranging gives $\quad x=\frac{4.87}{e^{2.68}}=4.87 e^{-2.68}$
i.e.
$$x=0.3339,$$
correct to 4 significant figures.

Problem 15. Solve $\frac{7}{4}=e^{3 x}$ correct to 4 significant figures

Taking natural logs of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& \ln \frac{7}{4}=\ln e^{3 x} \\
& \ln \frac{7}{4}=3 x \ln e
\end{aligned}$$

Since $\ln e=1, \quad \ln \frac{7}{4}=3 x$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
0.55962 & =3 x \\
x & =\mathbf{0 . 1 8 6 5}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
correct to 4 significant figures.

Problem 16. Solve $e^{x-1}=2 e^{3 x-4}$ correct to 4 significant figures

Taking natural logarithms of both sides gives
$$\ln \left(e^{x-1}\right)=\ln \left(2 e^{3 x-4}\right)$$
and by the first law of logarithms,
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\ln \left(e^{x-1}\right) & =\ln 2+\ln \left(e^{3 x-4}\right) \\
x-1 & =\ln 2+3 x-4
\end{aligned}$$

Rearranging gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& 4-1-\ln 2=3 x-x \\
& \text { i.e. } \quad \begin{aligned}
4-\ln 2 & =2 x \\
\text { from which, } \quad x & =\frac{3-\ln 2}{2}=\mathbf{1 . 1 5 3}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 17. Solve, correct to 4 significant figures, $\ln (x-2)^{2}=\ln (x-2)-\ln (x+3)+1.6$

Rearranging gives
$$\ln (x-2)^{2}-\ln (x-2)+\ln (x+3)=1.6$$
and by the laws of logarithms,
$$\ln \left\{\frac{(x-2)^{2}(x+3)}{(x-2)}\right\}=1.6$$

Cancelling gives
and
$$\ln \{(x-2)(x+3)\}=1.6$$
i.e.
$$(x-2)(x+3)=e^{1.6}$$
or
$$x^{2}+x-6-e^{1.6}=0$$
i.e.
$$x^{2}+x-10.953=0$$

Using the quadratic formula,
$$\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^{2}-4(1)(-10.953)}}{2} \\
& =\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{44.812}}{2} \\
& =\frac{-1 \pm 6.6942}{2} \\
\text { i.e. } \quad x & =2.847 \text { or }-3.8471
\end{aligned}$$
$x=-3.8471$ is not valid since the logarithm of a negative number has no real root.
Hence, the solution of the equation is $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2 . 8 4 7}$

\subsection*{16.5 Laws of growth and decay}

Laws of exponential growth and decay are of the form $y=A e^{-k x}$ and $y=A\left(1-e^{-k x}\right)$, where $A$ and $k$ are constants. When plotted, the form of these equations is as shown in Figure 16.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-138.jpg?height=807&width=601&top_left_y=1595&top_left_x=326)

Figure 16.5

The laws occur frequently in engineering and science and examples of quantities related by a natural law include:
(a) Linear expansion
$$l=l_{0} e^{\alpha \theta}$$
(b) Change in electrical resistance with temperature
$$R_{\theta}=R_{0} e^{\alpha \theta}$$
(c) Tension in belts
$$T_{1}=T_{0} e^{\mu \theta}$$
(d) Newton's law of cooling
$\theta=\theta_{0} e^{-k t}$
(e) Biological growth
$$y=y_{0} e^{k t}$$
(f) Discharge of a capacitor
$$q=Q e^{-t / C R}$$
(g) Atmospheric pressure
$$p=p_{0} e^{-h / c}$$
(h) Radioactive decay $N=N_{0} e^{-\lambda t}$
(i) Decay of current in an inductive circuit
$$i=I e^{-R t / L}$$
(j) Growth of current in a capacitive circuit
$$i=I\left(1-e^{-t / C R}\right)$$

Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the laws of growth and decay.

Problem 18. The resistance $R$ of an electrical conductor at temperature $\theta^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by $R=R_{0} e^{\alpha \theta}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant and $R_{0}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.
Determine the value of $\alpha$ correct to 4 significant figures when $R=6 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $\theta=1500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Also, find the temperature, correct to the nearest degree, when the resistance $R$ is $5.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega$

Transposing $R=R_{0} e^{\alpha \theta}$ gives $\frac{R}{R_{0}}=e^{\alpha \theta}$
Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides gives
$$\ln \frac{R}{R_{0}}=\ln e^{\alpha \theta}=\alpha \theta$$

Hence, $\alpha=\frac{1}{\theta} \ln \frac{R}{R_{0}}=\frac{1}{1500} \ln \left(\frac{6 \times 10^{3}}{5 \times 10^{3}}\right)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{1500}(0.1823215 \ldots) \\
& =1.215477 \ldots \times 10^{-4}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\mathbf{1 . 2 1 5} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{- 4}}$ correct to 4 significant figures.
From above, $\quad \ln \frac{R}{R_{0}}=\alpha \theta$ hence $\theta=\frac{1}{\alpha} \ln \frac{R}{R_{0}}$

When $R=5.4 \times 10^{3}, \alpha=1.215477 \ldots \times 10^{-4}$ and $R_{0}=5 \times 10^{3}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\theta & =\frac{1}{1.215477 \ldots \times 10^{-4}} \ln \left(\frac{5.4 \times 10^{3}}{5 \times 10^{3}}\right) \\
& =\frac{10^{4}}{1.215477 \ldots}\left(7.696104 \ldots \times 10^{-2}\right) \\
& =\mathbf{6 3 3}^{\circ} \mathbf{C} \text { correct to the nearest degree. }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 19. In an experiment involving Newton's law of cooling, the temperature $\theta\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is given by $\theta=\theta_{0} e^{-k t}$. Find the value of constant $k$ when $\theta_{0}=56.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \theta=16.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t=79.0$ seconds

Transposing $\theta=\theta_{0} e^{-k t}$ gives $\frac{\theta}{\theta_{0}}=e^{-k t}$, from which
$$\frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta}=\frac{1}{e^{-k t}}=e^{k t}$$

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides gives
$$\ln \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta}=k t$$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
k & =\frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta}=\frac{1}{79.0} \ln \left(\frac{56.6}{16.5}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{79.0}(1.2326486 \ldots)
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{k}=\mathbf{0 . 0 1 5 6 0}$ or $\mathbf{1 5 . 6 0} \times \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{- 3}}$.

Problem 20. The current $i$ amperes flowing in a capacitor at time $t$ seconds is given by $i=8.0\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{C R}}\right)$, where the circuit resistance $R$ is $25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and capacitance $C$ is $16 \mu \mathrm{~F}$. Determine (a) the current $i$ after 0.5 seconds and (b) the time, to the nearest millisecond, for the current to reach 6.0 A. Sketch the graph of current against time
(a) Current $i=8.0\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{C R}}\right)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =8.0\left[1-e^{-0.5 /\left(16 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(25 \times 10^{3}\right)}\right] \\
& =8.0\left(1-e^{-1.25}\right) \\
& =8.0(1-0.2865047 \ldots) \\
& =8.0(0.7134952 \ldots) \\
& =\mathbf{5 . 7 1} \text { amperes }
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Transposing $i=8.0\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{C R}}\right)$ gives
$$\frac{i}{8.0}=1-e^{-\frac{t}{C R}}$$
from which, $e^{-\frac{t}{C R}}=1-\frac{i}{8.0}=\frac{8.0-i}{8.0}$
Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives
$$e^{\frac{t}{C R}}=\frac{8.0}{8.0-i}$$

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides gives
$$\frac{t}{C R}=\ln \left(\frac{8.0}{8.0-i}\right)$$

Hence,
$$t=C R \ln \left(\frac{8.0}{8.0-i}\right)$$

When $i=6.0 \mathrm{~A}$,
$$t=\left(16 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(25 \times 10^{3}\right) \ln \left(\frac{8.0}{8.0-6.0}\right)$$
i.e. $\quad t=\frac{400}{10^{3}} \ln \left(\frac{8.0}{2.0}\right)=0.4 \ln 4.0$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =0.4(1.3862943 \ldots) \\
& =0.5545 \mathrm{~s} \\
& =\mathbf{5 5 5} \mathbf{m s} \text { correct to the nearest } \mathrm{ms} .
\end{aligned}$$

A graph of current against time is shown in Figure 16.6.

Problem 21. The temperature $\theta_{2}$ of a winding which is being heated electrically at time $t$ is given by $\theta_{2}=\theta_{1}\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)$, where $\theta_{1}$ is the temperature (in degrees Celsius) at time $t=0$ and $\tau$ is a constant. Calculate
(a) $\theta_{1}$, correct to the nearest degree, when $\theta_{2}$ is $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, t$ is 30 s and $\tau$ is 60 s and
(b) the time $t$, correct to 1 decimal place, for $\theta_{2}$ to be half the value of $\theta_{1}$
(a) Transposing the formula to make $\theta_{1}$ the subject gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{1} & =\frac{\theta_{2}}{\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)}=\frac{50}{1-e^{-30 / 60}} \\
& =\frac{50}{1-e^{-0.5}}=\frac{50}{0.393469 \ldots}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\quad \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\mathbf{1}}=\mathbf{1 2 7}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ correct to the nearest degree.
(b) Transposing to make $t$ the subject of the formula gives
$$\frac{\theta_{2}}{\theta_{1}}=1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$$
from which, $e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}=1-\frac{\theta_{2}}{\theta_{1}}$
Hence, $\quad-\frac{t}{\tau}=\ln \left(1-\frac{\theta_{2}}{\theta_{1}}\right)$
i.e. $\quad t=-\tau \ln \left(1-\frac{\theta_{2}}{\theta_{1}}\right)$

Since $\quad \theta_{2}=\frac{1}{2} \theta_{1}$
$$\begin{aligned}
t=-60 \ln \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) & =-60 \ln 0.5 \\
& =41.59 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the time for the temperature $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{2}$ to be one half of the value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}$ is $\mathbf{4 1 . 6} \mathrm{s}$, correct to $\mathbf{1}$ decimal place.

\section*{Chapter 17}

\section*{Straight line graphs}

\subsection*{17.1 Introduction to graphs}

A graph is a visual representation of information, showing how one quantity varies with another related quantity.
We often see graphs in newspapers or in business reports, in travel brochures and government publications. For example, a graph of the share price (in pence) over a six month period for a drinks company, Fizzy Pops, is shown in Figure 17.1.
Generally, we see that the share price increases to a high of 400 p in June, but dips down to around 280 p in August before recovering slightly in September.
A graph should convey information more quickly to the reader than if the same information was explained in words.
When this chapter is completed you should be able to draw up a table of values, plot co-ordinates, determine the gradient and state the equation of a straight line graph. Some typical practical examples are included in which straight lines are used.

\subsection*{17.2 Axes, scales and co-ordinates}

We are probably all familiar with reading a map to locate a town, or a local map to locate a particular street. For example, a street map of central Portsmouth is shown in Figure 17.2. Notice the squares drawn horizontally and vertically on the map; this is called a grid and enables us to locate a place of interest or a particular road. Most maps contain such a grid.
We locate places of interest on the map by stating a letter and a number - this is called the grid reference.
For example, on the map, the Portsmouth \& Southsea station is in square D2, King's Theatre is in square E5, HMS Warrior is in square A2, Gunwharf Quays is in square B3 and High Street is in square B4.
Portsmouth \& Southsea station is located by moving horizontally along the bottom of the map until the square labelled $D$ is reached and then moving vertically upwards until square 2 is met.
The letter/number, D2, is referred to as co-ordinates; i.e., co-ordinates are used to locate the position of

a point on a map. If you are familiar with using a map in this way then you should have no difficulties with graphs, because similar co-ordinates are used with graphs.

As stated earlier, a graph is a visual representation of information, showing how one quantity varies with another related quantity. The most common method of showing a relationship between two sets of data is to use a pair of reference axes - these are two lines drawn at right angles to each other (often called Cartesian or rectangular axes), as shown in Figure 17.3.

The horizontal axis is labelled the $x$-axis and the vertical axis is labelled the $y$-axis. The point where $x$ is 0 and $y$ is 0 is called the origin.
$x$ values have scales that are positive to the right of the origin and negative to the left. $y$ values have scales that are positive up from the origin and negative down from the origin.

Co-ordinates are written with brackets and a comma in between two numbers. For example, point $A$ is shown with co-ordinates $(3,2)$ and is located by starting at the

origin and moving 3 units in the positive $x$ direction (i.e. to the right) and then 2 units in the positive $y$ direction (i.e. up).

When co-ordinates are stated the first number is always the $x$ value and the second number is always
the $y$ value. In Figure 17.3, point $B$ has co-ordinates $(-4,3)$ and point $C$ has co-ordinates $(-3,-2)$.

\subsection*{17.3 Straight line graphs}

The distances travelled by a car in certain periods of time are shown in the following table of values.
\begin{tabular}{|lcccccc} 
Time (s) & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 \\
Distance travelled (m) & 50 & 100 & 150 & 200 & 250 & 300
\end{tabular}

We will plot time on the horizontal (or $x$ ) axis with a scale of $1 \mathrm{~cm}=10 \mathrm{~s}$.
We will plot distance on the vertical (or $y$ ) axis with a scale of $1 \mathrm{~cm}=50 \mathrm{~m}$.
(When choosing scales it is better to choose ones such as $1 \mathrm{~cm}=1$ unit, $1 \mathrm{~cm}=2$ units or $1 \mathrm{~cm}=10$ units because doing so makes reading values between these values easier.)

With the above data, the $(x, y)$ co-ordinates become (time, distance) co-ordinates; i.e., the co-ordinates are $(10,50),(20,100),(30,150)$, and so on.

The co-ordinates are shown plotted in Figure 17.4 using crosses. (Alternatively, a dot or a dot and circle may be used, as shown in Figure 17.3.)

A straight line is drawn through the plotted coordinates as shown in Figure 17.4.

\section*{Student task}

The following table gives the force $F$ newtons which, when applied to a lifting machine, overcomes a corresponding load of $L$ newtons.
\begin{tabular}{|lrrrrrr|}
\hline$F$ (Newtons) & 19 & 35 & 50 & 93 & 125 & 147 \\
\hline$L$ (Newtons) & 40 & 120 & 230 & 410 & 540 & 680 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
1. Plot $L$ horizontally and $F$ vertically.
2. Scales are normally chosen such that the graph occupies as much space as possible on the graph paper. So in this case, the following scales are chosen.
```
Horizontal axis (i.e. L): 1 cm = 50N
Vertical axis (i.e. F): 1 cm = 10N
```
3. Draw the axes and label them $L$ (newtons) for the horizontal axis and $F$ (newtons) for the vertical axis.
4. Label the origin as 0 .
5. Write on the horizontal scaling at $100,200,300$, and so on, every 2 cm .
6. Write on the vertical scaling at $10,20,30$, and so on, every 1 cm .
7. Plot on the graph the co-ordinates $(40,19)$, $(120,35),(230,50),(410,93),(540,125)$ and $(680,147)$, marking each with a cross or a dot.
8. Using a ruler, draw the best straight line through the points. You will notice that not all of the points lie exactly on a straight line. This is quite normal with experimental values. In a practical situation it would be surprising if all of the points lay exactly on a straight line.
9. Extend the straight line at each end.
10. From the graph, determine the force applied when the load is 325 N . It should be close to 75 N . This process of finding an equivalent value within the given data is called interpolation. Similarly, determine the load that a force of 45 N will overcome. It should be close to 170 N .
11. From the graph, determine the force needed to overcome a 750 N load. It should be close to 161 N . This process of finding an equivalent
value outside the given data is called extrapolation. To extrapolate we need to have extended the straight line drawn. Similarly, determine the force applied when the load is zero. It should be close to 11 N . The point where the straight line crosses the vertical axis is called the verticalaxis intercept. So, in this case, the vertical-axis intercept $=11 \mathrm{~N}$ at co-ordinates $(0,11)$.
The graph you have drawn should look something like Figure 17.5 shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-146.jpg?height=714&width=730&top_left_y=809&top_left_x=264)

Figure 17.5

In another example, let the relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$ be $y=3 x+2$.
When $x=0, y=0+2=2$
When $x=1, y=3+2=5$
When $x=2, y=6+2=8$, and so on.
The co-ordinates $(0,2),(1,5)$ and $(2,8)$ have been produced and are plotted, with others, as shown in Figure 17.6.
When the points are joined together a straight line graph results, i.e. $y=3 x+2$ is a straight line graph.

\subsection*{17.3.1 Summary of general rules to be applied when drawing graphs}
(a) Give the graph a title clearly explaining what is being illustrated.
(b) Choose scales such that the graph occupies as much space as possible on the graph paper being used.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-146.jpg?height=372&width=513&top_left_y=313&top_left_x=1208)

Figure 17.6 Graph of $y / x$
(c) Choose scales so that interpolation is made as easy as possible. Usually scales such as $1 \mathrm{~cm}=$ 1 unit, $1 \mathrm{~cm}=2$ units or $1 \mathrm{~cm}=10$ units are used. Awkward scales such as $1 \mathrm{~cm}=3$ units or $1 \mathrm{~cm}=7$ units should not be used.
(d) The scales need not start at zero, particularly when starting at zero produces an accumulation of points within a small area of the graph paper.
(e) The co-ordinates, or points, should be clearly marked. This is achieved by a cross, or a dot and circle, or just by a dot (see Figure 17.3).
(f) A statement should be made next to each axis explaining the numbers represented with their appropriate units.
(g) Sufficient numbers should be written next to each axis without cramping.

Problem 1. Plot the graph $y=4 x+3$ in the range $x=-3$ to $x=+4$. From the graph, find (a) the value of $y$ when $x=2.2$ and (b) the value of $x$ when $y=-3$

Whenever an equation is given and a graph is required, a table giving corresponding values of the variable is necessary. The table is achieved as follows:

When
$$\begin{aligned}
x=-3, y & =4 x+3=4(-3)+3 \\
& =-12+3=-9
\end{aligned}$$

When
$$\begin{aligned}
x=-2, y & =4(-2)+3 \\
& =-8+3=-5, \text { and so on. }
\end{aligned}$$

Such a table is shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrrrr|}
\hline$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
$y$ & -9 & -5 & -1 & 3 & 7 & 11 & 15 & 19
\end{tabular}

The co-ordinates $(-3,-9),(-2,-5),(-1,-1)$, and so on, are plotted and joined together to produce the

straight line shown in Figure 17.7. (Note that the scales used on the $x$ and $y$ axes do not have to be the same.) From the graph:
(a) when $x=2.2, \boldsymbol{y}=11.8$, and
(b) when $y=-3, \boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 5}$

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

Practice Exercise 67 Straight line graphs (answers on page 347)
1. Assuming graph paper measuring 20 cm by 20 cm is available, suggest suitable scales for the following ranges of values.
(a) Horizontal axis: 3 V to 55 V ; vertical axis: $10 \Omega$ to $180 \Omega$.
(b) Horizontal axis: 7 m to 86 m ; vertical axis: 0.3 V to 1.69 V .
(c) Horizontal axis: 5 N to 150 N ; vertical axis: 0.6 mm to 3.4 mm .
2. Corresponding values obtained experimentally for two quantities are
$$\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & -5 & -3 & -1 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
y & -13 & -9 & -5 & -3 & 1 & 5
\end{array}$$

Plot a graph of $y$ (vertically) against $x$ (horizontally) to scales of $2 \mathrm{~cm}=1$ for the horizontal $x$-axis and $1 \mathrm{~cm}=1$ for the vertical $y$-axis. (This graph will need the whole of the graph paper with the origin somewhere in the centre of the paper).

From the graph, find
(a) the value of $y$ when $x=1$
(b) the value of $y$ when $x=-2.5$
(c) the value of $x$ when $y=-6$
(d) the value of $x$ when $y=7$
3. Corresponding values obtained experimentally for two quantities are
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrr}
$x$ & -2.0 & -0.5 & 0 & 1.0 & 2.5 & 3.0 & 5.0 \\
$y$ & -13.0 & -5.5 & -3.0 & 2.0 & 9.5 & 12.0 & 22.0
\end{tabular}

Use a horizontal scale for $x$ of $1 \mathrm{~cm}=\frac{1}{2}$ unit and a vertical scale for $y$ of $1 \mathrm{~cm}=2$ units and draw a graph of $x$ against $y$. Label the graph and each of its axes. By interpolation, find from the graph the value of $y$ when $x$ is 3.5 .
4. Draw a graph of $y-3 x+5=0$ over a range of $x=-3$ to $x=4$. Hence determine
(a) the value of $y$ when $x=1.3$
(b) the value of $x$ when $y=-9.2$
5. The speed $n \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$ of a motor changes when the voltage $V$ across the armature is varied. The results are shown in the following table.
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr|}
$n$ (rev/min) & 560 & 720 & 900 & 1010 & 1240 & 1410 \\
$V$ (volts) & 80 & 100 & 120 & 140 & 160 & 180
\end{tabular}

It is suspected that one of the readings taken of the speed is inaccurate. Plot a graph of speed (horizontally) against voltage (vertically) and find this value. Find also
(a) the speed at a voltage of 132 V .
(b) the voltage at a speed of $1300 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$.

\subsection*{17.4 Gradients, intercepts and equations of graphs}

\subsection*{17.4.1 Gradients}

The gradient or slope of a straight line is the ratio of the change in the value of $y$ to the change in the value of $x$ between any two points on the line. If, as $x$ increases, $(\rightarrow), y$ also increases, $(\uparrow)$, then the gradient is positive.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-148.jpg?height=788&width=788&top_left_y=303&top_left_x=238)

Figure 17.8

In Figure 17.8(a), a straight line graph $y=2 x+1$ is shown. To find the gradient of this straight line, choose two points on the straight line graph, such as $A$ and $C$. Then construct a right-angled triangle, such as $A B C$, where $B C$ is vertical and $A B$ is horizontal.

Then, gradient of $\boldsymbol{A C}=\frac{\text { change in } y}{\text { change in } x}=\frac{C B}{B A}$
$$=\frac{7-3}{3-1}=\frac{4}{2}=\mathbf{2}$$

In Figure 17.8(b), a straight line graph $y=-3 x+2$ is shown. To find the gradient of this straight line, choose two points on the straight line graph, such as $D$ and $F$. Then construct a right-angled triangle, such as $D E F$, where $E F$ is vertical and $D E$ is horizontal.

Then, gradient of $\boldsymbol{D F}=\frac{\text { change in } y}{\text { change in } x}=\frac{F E}{E D}$
$$=\frac{11-2}{-3-0}=\frac{9}{-3}=-\mathbf{3}$$

Figure 17.8(c) shows a straight line graph $y=3$. Since the straight line is horizontal the gradient is zero.

\subsection*{17.4.2 The $y$-axis intercept}

The value of $y$ when $x=0$ is called the $y$-axis intercept. In Figure 17.8(a) the $y$-axis intercept is 1 and in Figure 17.8(b) the $y$-axis intercept is 2 .

\subsection*{17.4.3 The equation of a straight line graph}

The general equation of a straight line graph is
$$y=m x+c$$
where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the $y$-axis intercept. Thus, as we have found in Figure 17.8(a), $y=2 x+1$ represents a straight line of gradient 2 and $y$-axis intercept 1 . So, given the equation $y=2 x+1$, we are able to state, on sight, that the gradient $=2$ and the $y$-axis intercept $=1$, without the need for any analysis.
Similarly, in Figure 17.8(b), $y=-3 x+2$ represents a straight line of gradient -3 and $y$-axis intercept 2 .
In Figure 17.8(c), $y=3$ may be rewritten as $y=0 x+3$ and therefore represents a straight line of gradient 0 and $y$-axis intercept 3 .
Here are some worked problems to help understanding of gradients, intercepts and equations of graphs.

Problem 2. Plot the following graphs on the same axes in the range $x=-4$ to $x=+4$ and determine the gradient of each.
(a) $y=x$
(b) $y=x+2$
(c) $y=x+5$
(d) $y=x-3$

A table of co-ordinates is produced for each graph.
(a) $y=x$
\begin{tabular}{|llllllllll|}
$x$ & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
$y$ & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{tabular}
(b) $y=x+2$
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrr}
$x$ & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
$y$ & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6
\end{tabular}
(c) $y=x+5$
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrr}
$x$ & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
$y$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{tabular}
(d) $y=x-3$
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrrrrr|}
$x$ & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
$y$ & -7 & -6 & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1
\end{tabular}

The co-ordinates are plotted and joined for each graph. The results are shown in Figure 17.9. Each of the straight lines produced is parallel to the others; i.e., the slope or gradient is the same for each.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-149.jpg?height=877&width=519&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=397)

Figure 17.9
To find the gradient of any straight line, say, $y=x-3$, a horizontal and vertical component needs to be constructed. In Figure 17.9, $A B$ is constructed vertically at $x=4$ and $B C$ is constructed horizontally at $y=-3$.

The gradient of $A C=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{1-(-3)}{4-0}=\frac{4}{4}=1$
i.e. the gradient of the straight line $y=x-3$ is 1 , which could have been deduced 'on sight' since $y=1 x-3$ represents a straight line graph with gradient 1 and $y$-axis intercept of -3 .
The actual positioning of $A B$ and $B C$ is unimportant because the gradient is also given by
$$\frac{D E}{E F}=\frac{-1-(-2)}{2-1}=\frac{1}{1}=1$$

The slope or gradient of each of the straight lines in Figure 17.9 is thus 1 since they are parallel to each other.

Problem 3. Plot the following graphs on the same axes between the values $x=-3$ to $x=+3$ and determine the gradient and $y$-axis intercept of each.
(a) $y=3 x$
(b) $y=3 x+7$
(c) $y=-4 x+4$
(d) $y=-4 x-5$

A table of co-ordinates is drawn up for each equation.
(a) $y=3 x$
\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
$y$ & -9 & -6 & -3 & 0 & 3 & 6 & 9
\end{tabular}
(b) $y=3 x+7$
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrr}
$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
$y$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 13 & 16
\end{tabular}
(c) $y=-4 x+4$
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrrr|}
$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
$y$ & 16 & 12 & 8 & 4 & 0 & -4 & -8
\end{tabular}
(d) $y=-4 x-5$
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrrr|}
$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
$y$ & 7 & 3 & -1 & -5 & -9 & -13 & -17
\end{tabular}

Each of the graphs is plotted as shown in Figure 17.10 and each is a straight line. $y=3 x$ and $y=3 x+7$ are parallel to each other and thus have the same gradient. The gradient of $A C$ is given by
$$\frac{C B}{B A}=\frac{16-7}{3-0}=\frac{9}{3}=3$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-149.jpg?height=619&width=509&top_left_y=1586&top_left_x=1237)

Figure 17.10
Hence, the gradients of both $y=3 x$ and $y=3 x+7$ are 3 , which could have been deduced 'on sight'. $y=-4 x+4$ and $y=-4 x-5$ are parallel to each other and thus have the same gradient. The gradient of $D F$ is
given by
$$\frac{F E}{E D}=\frac{-5-(-17)}{0-3}=\frac{12}{-3}=-4$$

Hence, the gradient of both $y=-4 x+4$ and $y=-4 x-5$ is -4 , which, again, could have been deduced 'on sight'.
The $y$-axis intercept means the value of $y$ where the straight line cuts the $y$-axis. From Figure 17.10,
$$\begin{aligned}
& y=3 x \text { cuts the } y \text {-axis at } y=0 \\
& y=3 x+7 \text { cuts the } y \text {-axis at } y=+7 \\
& y=-4 x+4 \text { cuts the } y \text {-axis at } y=+4 \\
& y=-4 x-5 \text { cuts the } y \text {-axis at } y=-5
\end{aligned}$$

Some general conclusions can be drawn from the graphs shown in Figures 17.9 and 17.10. When an equation is of the form $y=m x+c$, where $m$ and $c$ are constants, then
(a) $a$ graph of $y$ against $x$ produces a straight line,
(b) $m$ represents the slope or gradient of the line, and
(c) $c$ represents the $y$-axis intercept.

Thus, given an equation such as $y=3 x+7$, it may be deduced 'on sight' that its gradient is +3 and its $y$-axis intercept is +7 , as shown in Figure 17.10. Similarly, if $y=-4 x-5$, the gradient is -4 and the $y$-axis intercept is -5 , as shown in Figure 17.10.
When plotting a graph of the form $y=m x+c$, only two co-ordinates need be determined. When the co-ordinates are plotted a straight line is drawn between the two points. Normally, three co-ordinates are determined, the third one acting as a check.

Problem 4. Plot the graph $3 x+y+1=0$ and $2 y-5=x$ on the same axes and find their point of intersection

Rearranging $3 x+y+1=0$ gives $y=-3 x-1$

Rearranging $2 y-5=x$ gives $2 y=x+5$ and
$$y=\frac{1}{2} x+2 \frac{1}{2}$$

Since both equations are of the form $y=m x+c$, both are straight lines. Knowing an equation is a straight line means that only two co-ordinates need to be plotted and a straight line drawn through them. A third co-ordinate is usually determined to act as a check.

A table of values is produced for each equation as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{ccrr|}
$x$ & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
$-3 x-1$ & -4 & -1 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{cccr|}
$x$ & 2 & 0 & -3 \\
\hline$\frac{1}{2} x+2 \frac{1}{2}$ & $3 \frac{1}{2}$ & $2 \frac{1}{2}$ & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The graphs are plotted as shown in Figure 17.11.
The two straight lines are seen to intersect at (-1,2).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-150.jpg?height=633&width=644&top_left_y=844&top_left_x=1142)

Figure 17.11

Problem 5. If graphs of $y$ against $x$ were to be plotted for each of the following, state (i) the gradient and (ii) the $y$-axis intercept.
(a) $y=9 x+2$
(b) $y=-4 x+7$
(c) $y=3 x$
(d) $y=-5 x-3$
(e) $y=6$
(f) $y=x$

If $y=m x+c$ then $m=$ gradient and $c=y$-axis intercept.
(a) If $y=9 x+2$, then
(i) $\boldsymbol{g r a d i e n t}=\mathbf{9}$
(ii) $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{2}$
(b) If $y=-4 x+7$, then
(i) gradient $=-4$
(ii) $y$-axis intercept $=7$
(c) If $y=3 x$ i.e. $y=3 x+0$,
then
(i) gradient $=\mathbf{3}$
(ii) $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{0}$
i.e. the straight line passes through the origin.
(d) If $y=-5 x-3$, then
(i) gradient $=-5$
(ii) $y$-axis intercept $=-3$
(e) If $y=6$ i.e. $y=0 x+6$,
then
(i) gradient $=\mathbf{0}$
(ii) $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{6}$
i.e. $y=6$ is a straight horizontal line.
(f) If $y=x$ i.e. $y=1 x+0$,
then
(i) gradient $=\mathbf{1}$
(ii) $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{0}$

Since $y=x$, as $x$ increases, $y$ increases by the same amount; i.e., $\boldsymbol{y}$ is directly proportional to $\boldsymbol{x}$.

Problem 6. Without drawing graphs, determine the gradient and $y$-axis intercept for each of the following equations.
(a) $y+4=3 x$
(b) $2 y+8 x=6$
(c) $3 x=4 y+7$

If $y=m x+c$ then $m=$ gradient and $c=y$-axis intercept.
(a) Transposing $y+4=3 x$ gives $y=3 x-4$

Hence, gradient $=3$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{- 4}$.
(b) Transposing $2 y+8 x=6$ gives $2 y=-8 x+6$

Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y=-4 x+3$
Hence, gradient $=\mathbf{- 4}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=3$.
(c) Transposing $3 x=4 y+7$ gives $3 x-7=4 y$
or
$$4 y=3 x-7$$

Dividing both sides by 4 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& y=\frac{3}{4} x-\frac{7}{4} \\
& y=0.75 x-1.75
\end{aligned}$$
or
ence, gradient $=0.75$ and $y$-axis intercept $=-1.75$

Problem 7. Without plotting graphs, determine the gradient and $y$-axis intercept values of the following equations.
(a) $y=7 x-3$
(b) $3 y=-6 x+2$
(c) $y-2=4 x+9$
(d) $\frac{y}{3}=\frac{x}{3}-\frac{1}{5}$
(e) $2 x+9 y+1=0$
(a) $y=7 x-3$ is of the form $y=m x+c$

Hence, gradient, $\boldsymbol{m}=7$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept, $c=-3$.
(b) Rearranging $3 y=-6 x+2$ gives $y=-\frac{6 x}{3}+\frac{2}{3}$, i.e.
which is of the form $y=m x+c$ $y=-2 x+\frac{2}{3}$

Hence, gradient $\boldsymbol{m}=\mathbf{- 2}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept, $c=\frac{2}{3}$
(c) Rearranging $y-2=4 x+9$ gives $y=4 x+11$.

Hence, gradient $=\mathbf{4}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $=\mathbf{1 1}$.
(d) Rearranging $\frac{y}{3}=\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{5}$ gives $y=3\left(\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{5}\right)$ $=\frac{3}{2} x-\frac{3}{5}$
Hence, gradient $=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{2}}$ and
$y$-axis intercept $=-\frac{3}{5}$
(e) Rearranging $2 x+9 y+1=0$ gives $9 y=-2 x-1$, i.e. $y=-\frac{2}{9} x-\frac{1}{9}$

Hence, gradient $=-\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{9}}$ and $y$-axis intercept $=-\frac{1}{9}$

(a) A right-angled triangle $A B C$ is constructed on the graph as shown in Figure 17.13.
$$\text { Gradient }=\frac{A C}{C B}=\frac{23-8}{4-1}=\frac{15}{3}=\mathbf{5}$$

Figure 17.13
(b) The $y$-axis intercept at $x=0$ is seen to be at $y=3$.
$y=m x+c$ is a straight line graph where $m=$ gradient and $c=y$-axis intercept.

From above, $m=5$ and $c=3$.
Hence, the equation of the graph is $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{5 x + 3}$.
Problem 9. Determine the equation of the straight line shown in Figure 17.14.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-152.jpg?height=628&width=641&top_left_y=1503&top_left_x=311)

Figure 17.14

The triangle $D E F$ is shown constructed in Figure 17.14.
Gradient of $D E=\frac{D F}{F E}=\frac{3-(-3)}{-1-2}=\frac{6}{-3}=-2$
and the $y$-axis intercept $=1$.

Hence, the equation of the straight line is $y=m x+c$ i.e. $y=-2 x+1$.

Problem 10. The velocity of a body was measured at various times and the results obtained were as follows:
\begin{tabular}{lccccccc} 
Velocity $v(\mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})$ & 8 & 10.5 & 13 & 15.5 & 18 & 20.5 & 23 \\
Time $t(\mathrm{~s})$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7
\end{tabular}

Plot a graph of velocity (vertically) against time (horizontally) and determine the equation of the graph

Suitable scales are chosen and the co-ordinates $(1,8)$, $(2,10.5),(3,13)$, and so on, are plotted as shown in Figure 17.15.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-152.jpg?height=804&width=649&top_left_y=1141&top_left_x=1145)

Figure 17.15

The right-angled triangle $P R Q$ is constructed on the graph as shown in Figure 17.15.
$$\text { Gradient of } P Q=\frac{P R}{R Q}=\frac{18-8}{5-1}=\frac{10}{4}=\mathbf{2 . 5}$$

The vertical axis intercept is at $v=\mathbf{5 . 5} \mathbf{~ m} / \mathrm{s}$.
The equation of a straight line graph is $y=m x+c$. In this case, $t$ corresponds to $x$ and $v$ corresponds to $y$. Hence, the equation of the graph shown in Figure 17.15
is $v=m t+c$. But, from above, gradient, $m=2.5$ and $v$-axis intercept, $c=5.5$.
Hence, the equation of the graph is $\boldsymbol{v}=\mathbf{2 . 5 t} \boldsymbol{+ 5 . 5}$

Problem 11. Determine the gradient of the straight line graph passing through the co-ordinates (a) $(-2,5)$ and $(3,4)$, and (b) $(-2,-3)$ and $(-1,3)$

From Figure 17.16, a straight line graph passing through co-ordinates $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ has a gradient given by
$$m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-153.jpg?height=359&width=617&top_left_y=1014&top_left_x=348)

Figure 17.16
(a) A straight line passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(3,4)$, hence $x_{1}=-2, y_{1}=5, x_{2}=3$ and $y_{2}=4$, hence, gradient, $\boldsymbol{m}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\frac{4-5}{3-(-2)}=-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{5}}$
(b) A straight line passes through $(-2,-3)$ and $(-1,3)$, hence $x_{1}=-2, y_{1}=-3, x_{2}=-1$ and $y_{2}=3$, hence, gradient,
$\boldsymbol{m}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\frac{3-(-3)}{-1-(-2)}=\frac{3+3}{-1+2}=\frac{6}{1}=\mathbf{6}$

\subsection*{17.5 Practical problems involving straight line graphs}

When a set of co-ordinate values are given or are obtained experimentally and it is believed that they follow a law of the form $y=m x+c$, if a straight line can be drawn reasonably close to most of the co-ordinate
values when plotted, this verifies that a law of the form $y=m x+c$ exists. From the graph, constants $m$ (i.e. gradient) and $c$ (i.e. $y$-axis intercept) can be determined.
Here are some worked problems in which practical situations are featured.

Problem 12. The temperature in degrees Celsius and the corresponding values in degrees Fahrenheit are shown in the table below. Construct rectangular axes, choose suitable scales and plot a graph of degrees Celsius (on the horizontal axis) against degrees Fahrenheit (on the vertical scale).
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & 10 & 20 & 40 & 60 & 80 & 100 \\
\hline${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ & 50 & 68 & 104 & 140 & 176 & 212 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

From the graph find (a) the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, (b) the temperature in degrees Celsius at $167^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, (c) the Fahrenheit temperature at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and (d) the Celsius temperature at $230^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

The co-ordinates $(10,50),(20,68),(40,104)$, and so on are plotted as shown in Figure 17.17. When the co-ordinates are joined, a straight line is produced. Since a straight line results, there is a linear relationship between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-154.jpg?height=774&width=774&top_left_y=1479&top_left_x=1077)

Figure 17.17
(a) To find the Fahrenheit temperature at $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a vertical line $A B$ is constructed from the horizontal axis to meet the straight line at $B$. The point where the
horizontal line $B D$ meets the vertical axis indicates the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature.
Hence, $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is equivalent to $131^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
This process of finding an equivalent value in between the given information in the above table is called interpolation.
(b) To find the Celsius temperature at $167^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, a horizontal line $E F$ is constructed as shown in Figure 17.17. The point where the vertical line $F G$ cuts the horizontal axis indicates the equivalent Celsius temperature.
Hence, $167^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ is equivalent to $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(c) If the graph is assumed to be linear even outside of the given data, the graph may be extended at both ends (shown by broken lines in Figure 17.17).
From Figure $17.17, \mathbf{0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ corresponds to $32^{\circ} \mathbf{F}$.
(d) $230^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ is seen to correspond to $\mathbf{1 1 0}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The process of finding equivalent values outside of the given range is called extrapolation.

Problem 13. In an experiment on Charles's law, the value of the volume of gas, $V \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, was measured for various temperatures $T^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The results are shown below.
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
$V \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ & 25.0 & 25.8 & 26.6 & 27.4 & 28.2 & 29.0 \\
$T^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & 60 & 65 & 70 & 75 & 80 & 85
\end{tabular}

Plot a graph of volume (vertical) against temperature (horizontal) and from it find (a) the temperature when the volume is $28.6 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and (b) the volume when the temperature is $67^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

If a graph is plotted with both the scales starting at zero then the result is as shown in Figure 17.18. All of the points lie in the top right-hand corner of the graph, making interpolation difficult. A more accurate graph is obtained if the temperature axis starts at $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the volume axis starts at $24.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. The axes corresponding to these values are shown by the broken lines in Figure 17.18 and are called false axes, since the origin is not now at zero. A magnified version of this relevant part of the graph is shown in Figure 17.19. From the graph,
(a) When the volume is $28.6 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, the equivalent temperature is $\mathbf{8 2 . 5}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(b) When the temperature is $67^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the equivalent volume is $\mathbf{2 6 . 1} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}$.

Problem 14. In an experiment demonstrating Hooke's law, the strain in an aluminium wire was measured for various stresses. The results were:
\begin{tabular}{llll|}
\hline Stress $\left(\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ & 4.9 & 8.7 & 15.0 \\
\hline Strain & 0.00007 & 0.00013 & 0.00021 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline Stress $\left(\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ & 18.4 & 24.2 & 27.3 \\
\hline Strain & 0.00027 & 0.00034 & 0.00039
\end{tabular}

Plot a graph of stress (vertically) against strain (horizontally). Find (a) Young's modulus of elasticity for aluminium, which is given by the gradient of the graph, (b) the value of the strain at a stress of $20 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}$ and (c) the value of the stress when the strain is 0.00020

The co-ordinates ( $0.00007,4.9$ ), ( $0.00013,8.7$ ), and so on, are plotted as shown in Figure 17.20. The graph produced is the best straight line which can be drawn corresponding to these points. (With experimental results it is unlikely that all the points will lie exactly on a straight line.) The graph, and each of its axes, are labelled. Since the straight line passes through the origin, stress is directly proportional to strain for the given range of values.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-156.jpg?height=551&width=633&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=318)

Figure 17.20
(a) The gradient of the straight line $A C$ is given by
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{A B}{B C} & =\frac{28-7}{0.00040-0.00010}=\frac{21}{0.00030} \\
& =\frac{21}{3 \times 10^{-4}}=\frac{7}{10^{-4}}=7 \times 10^{4} \\
& =70000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, Young's modulus of elasticity for aluminium is $70000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}$. Since $1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}=10^{6} \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$, $70000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}$ is equivalent to $70000 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, i.e. $\mathbf{7 0} \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (or pascals).

From Figure 17.20,
(b) The value of the strain at a stress of $20 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}$ is 0.000285
(c) The value of the stress when the strain is 0.00020 is $14 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}^{2}$.

Problem 15. The following values of resistance $R$ ohms and corresponding voltage $V$ volts are obtained from a test on a filament lamp.
\begin{tabular}{|lllrrr|}
\hline$R$ ohms & 30 & 48.5 & 73 & 107 & 128 \\
\hline$V$ volts & 16 & 29 & 52 & 76 & 94 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Choose suitable scales and plot a graph with $R$ representing the vertical axis and $V$ the horizontal axis. Determine (a) the gradient of the graph, (b) the $R$ axis intercept value, (c) the equation of the graph, (d) the value of resistance when the voltage is 60 V and (e) the value of the voltage when the resistance is 40 ohms. (f) If the graph were to continue in the same manner, what value of resistance would be obtained at 110 V ?

The co-ordinates $(16,30),(29,48.5)$, and so on are shown plotted in Figure 17.21, where the best straight line is drawn through the points.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-156.jpg?height=855&width=779&top_left_y=1297&top_left_x=1080)

Figure 17.21
(a) The slope or gradient of the straight line $A C$ is given by
$$\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{135-10}{100-0}=\frac{125}{100}=\mathbf{1 . 2 5}$$
(Note that the vertical line $A B$ and the horizontal line $B C$ may be constructed anywhere along the length of the straight line. However, calculations are made easier if the horizontal line $B C$ is carefully chosen; in this case, 100.)
(b) The $R$-axis intercept is at $\boldsymbol{R}=\mathbf{1 0} \mathbf{o h m s}$ (by extrapolation).
(c) The equation of a straight line is $y=m x+c$, when $y$ is plotted on the vertical axis and $x$ on the horizontal axis. $m$ represents the gradient and $c$ the $y$-axis intercept. In this case, $R$ corresponds to $y$, $V$ corresponds to $x, m=1.25$ and $c=10$. Hence, the equation of the graph is $\boldsymbol{R}=(\mathbf{1 . 2 5} \mathrm{V}+\mathbf{1 0}) \boldsymbol{\Omega}$.

From Figure 17.21,
(d) When the voltage is 60 V , the resistance is $\mathbf{8 5 \Omega}$.
(e) When the resistance is 40 ohms , the voltage is $\mathbf{2 4 V}$.
(f) By extrapolation, when the voltage is 110 V , the resistance is $\mathbf{1 4 7 \Omega}$.

Problem 16. Experimental tests to determine the breaking stress $\sigma$ of rolled copper at various temperatures $t$ gave the following results.
\begin{tabular}{|l|ccc|}
\hline Stress $\sigma\left(\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ & 8.46 & 8.04 & 7.78 \\
\hline Temperature $t\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ & 70 & 200 & 280 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|lll|}
\hline Stress $\sigma\left(\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ & 7.37 & 7.08 & 6.63 \\
\hline Temperature $t\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ & 410 & 500 & 640 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Show that the values obey the law $\sigma=a t+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and determine approximate values for $a$ and $b$. Use the law to determine the stress at $250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the temperature when the stress is $7.54 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

The co-ordinates (70, 8.46), (200, 8.04), and so on, are plotted as shown in Figure 17.22. Since the graph is a straight line then the values obey the law $\sigma=a t+b$, and the gradient of the straight line is
$$a=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{8.36-6.76}{100-600}=\frac{1.60}{-500}=-\mathbf{0 . 0 0 3 2}$$

Vertical axis intercept, $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{8 . 6 8}$
Hence, the law of the graph is $\sigma=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 3 2 t + 8 . 6 8}$ When the temperature is $250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, stress $\sigma$ is given by
$$\sigma=-0.0032(250)+8.68=\mathbf{7 . 8 8} \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-157.jpg?height=720&width=662&top_left_y=307&top_left_x=1166)

Figure 17.22

Rearranging $\sigma=-0.0032 t+8.68$ gives
$$0.0032 t=8.68-\sigma, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad t=\frac{8.68-\sigma}{0.0032}$$

Hence, when the stress, $\sigma=7.54 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$,
$$\text { temperature, } t=\frac{8.68-7.54}{0.0032}=\mathbf{3 5 6 . 3}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$$

\section*{Graphs reducing non-linear laws to linear form}

\subsection*{18.1 Introduction}

In Chapter 17 we discovered that the equation of a straight line graph is of the form $y=m x+c$, where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the $y$-axis intercept. This chapter explains how the law of a graph can still be determined even when it is not of the linear form $y=m x+c$. The method used is called determination of law and is explained in the following sections.

\subsection*{18.2 Determination of law}

Frequently, the relationship between two variables, say $x$ and $y$, is not a linear one; i.e., when $x$ is plotted against $y$ a curve results. In such cases the non-linear equation may be modified to the linear form, $y=m x+c$, so that the constants, and thus the law relating the variables, can be determined. This technique is called 'determination of law'.
Some examples of the reduction of equations to linear form include
(i) $y=a x^{2}+b$ compares with $Y=m X+c$, where $m=a, c=b$ and $X=x^{2}$.
Hence, $y$ is plotted vertically against $x^{2}$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $a$ and $y$-axis intercept $b$.
(ii) $y=\frac{a}{x}+b$, i.e. $y=a\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)+b$
$y$ is plotted vertically against $\frac{1}{x}$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $a$ and $y$-axis intercept $b$.
(iii) $y=a x^{2}+b x$

Dividing both sides by $x$ gives $\frac{y}{x}=a x+b$.
Comparing with $Y=m X+c$ shows that $\frac{y}{x}$ is plotted vertically against $x$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $a$ and $\frac{y}{x}$ axis intercept $b$.

Here are some worked problems to demonstrate determination of law.

Problem 1. Experimental values of $x$ and $y$, shown below, are believed to be related by the law $y=a x^{2}+b$. By plotting a suitable graph, verify this law and determine approximate values of $a$ and $b$
\begin{tabular}{|cccccc|}
\hline$x$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline$y$ & 9.8 & 15.2 & 24.2 & 36.5 & 53.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

If $y$ is plotted against $x$ a curve results and it is not possible to determine the values of constants $a$ and $b$ from the curve.
Comparing $y=a x^{2}+b$ with $Y=m X+c$ shows that $y$ is to be plotted vertically against $x^{2}$ horizontally. A table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|cccccc|}
\hline$x$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline$x^{2}$ & 1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline$y$ & 9.8 & 15.2 & 24.2 & 36.5 & 53.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of $y$ against $x^{2}$ is shown in Figure 18.1, with the best straight line drawn through the points. Since a straight line graph results, the law is verified.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-161.jpg?height=752&width=774&top_left_y=492&top_left_x=269)

Figure 18.1

From the graph,
$$\text { gradient, } \begin{aligned}
a & =\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{53-17}{25-5} \\
& =\frac{36}{20}=\mathbf{1 . 8}
\end{aligned}$$
and the $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept, $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{8 . 0}$
Hence, the law of the graph is $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{1 . 8} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}+\mathbf{8 . 0}$
Problem 2. Values of load $L$ newtons and distance $d$ metres obtained experimentally are shown in the following table.
\begin{tabular}{lcccc} 
Load, $L(\mathrm{~N})$ & 32.3 & 29.6 & 27.0 & 23.2 \\
Distance, $d(\mathrm{~m})$ & 0.75 & 0.37 & 0.24 & 0.17
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc|}
\hline Load, $L(\mathrm{~N})$ & 18.3 & 12.8 & 10.0 & 6.4 \\
Distance, $d(\mathrm{~m})$ & 0.12 & 0.09 & 0.08 & 0.07
\end{tabular}
(a) Verify that load and distance are related by a law of the form $L=\frac{a}{d}+b$ and determine approximate values of $a$ and $b$.
(b) Hence, calculate the load when the distance is 0.20 m and the distance when the load is 20 N .
(a) Comparing $L=\frac{a}{d}+b$ i.e. $L=a\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)+b$ with $Y=m X+c$ shows that $L$ is to be plotted vertically against $\frac{1}{d}$ horizontally. Another table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|lllllllll|}
$L$ & 32.3 & 29.6 & 27.0 & 23.2 & 18.3 & 12.8 & 10.0 & 6.4 \\
\hline$d$ & 0.75 & 0.37 & 0.24 & 0.17 & 0.12 & 0.09 & 0.08 & 0.07 \\
$\frac{1}{d}$ & 1.33 & 2.70 & 4.17 & 5.88 & 8.33 & 11.11 & 12.50 & 14.29 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of $L$ against $\frac{1}{d}$ is shown in Figure 18.2. A
straight line can be drawn through the points, which verifies that load and distance are related by a law of the form $L=\frac{a}{d}+b$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-161.jpg?height=741&width=739&top_left_y=1061&top_left_x=1122)

Figure 18.2
$$\text { Gradient of straight line, } \begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{a}=\frac{A B}{B C} & =\frac{31-11}{2-12} \\
& =\frac{20}{-10}=\mathbf{- 2} .
\end{aligned}$$
$L$-axis intercept, $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{3 5}$.
Hence, the law of the graph is $L=-\frac{\mathbf{2}}{\boldsymbol{d}}+\mathbf{3 5}$.
(b) When the distance $d=0.20 \mathrm{~m}$,
load, $L=\frac{-2}{0.20}+35=\mathbf{2 5 . 0} \mathbf{N}$.
Rearranging $L=-\frac{2}{d}+35$ gives
$\frac{2}{d}=35-L \quad$ and $\quad d=\frac{2}{35-L}$

Hence, when the load $L=20 \mathrm{~N}$, distance, $\boldsymbol{d}=\frac{2}{35-20}=\frac{2}{15}=\mathbf{0 . 1 3 m}$.

Problem 3. The solubility $s$ of potassium chlorate is shown by the following table.
\begin{tabular}{|lllllllll|}
\hline$t^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 10$ & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 80 & 100 \\
\hline$s$ & 4.9 & 7.6 & 11.1 & 15.4 & 20.4 & 26.4 & 40.6 & 58.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The relationship between $s$ and $t$ is thought to be of the form $s=3+a t+b t^{2}$. Plot a graph to test the supposition and use the graph to find approximate values of $a$ and $b$. Hence, calculate the solubility of potassium chlorate at $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

Rearranging $s=3+a t+b t^{2}$ gives
and
$$s-3=a t+b t^{2}$$
$$\frac{s-3}{t}=a+b t$$
or
$$\frac{s-3}{t}=b t+a$$
which is of the form $\quad Y=m X+c$
This shows that $\frac{s-3}{t}$ is to be plotted vertically and $t$ horizontally, with gradient $b$ and vertical axis intercept $a$.
Another table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|lllllllll|}
\hline$t$ & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 80 & 100 \\
\hline$s$ & 4.9 & 7.6 & 11.1 & 15.4 & 20.4 & 26.4 & 40.6 & 58.0 \\
\hline$\frac{s-3}{t}$ & 0.19 & 0.23 & 0.27 & 0.31 & 0.35 & 0.39 & 0.47 & 0.55 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of $\frac{s-3}{t}$ against $t$ is shown plotted in Figure
18.3. A straight line fits the points, which shows that $s$ and $t$ are related by $s=3+a t+b t^{2}$.
Gradient of straight line, $\boldsymbol{b}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{0.39-0.19}{60-10}$
$$=\frac{0.20}{50}=\mathbf{0 . 0 0 4}$$

Vertical axis intercept, $\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{0 . 1 5}$
Hence, the law of the graph is $s=\mathbf{3 + 0 . 1 5 t + 0 . 0 0 4} \boldsymbol{t}^{\mathbf{2}}$. The solubility of potassium chlorate at $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by
$$\begin{aligned}
s & =3+0.15(70)+0.004(70)^{2} \\
& =3+10.5+19.6=\mathbf{3 3 . 1}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

Practice Exercise 70 Graphs reducing non-linear laws to linear form (answers on page 348)

In problems 1 to $5, x$ and $y$ are two related variables and all other letters denote constants. For the stated laws to be verified it is necessary to plot graphs of the variables in a modified form. State for each, (a) what should be plotted on the vertical axis, (b) what should be plotted on the horizontal axis, (c) the gradient and (d) the vertical axis intercept.
1. $y=d+c x^{2}$
2. $y-a=b \sqrt{x}$
3. $y-e=\frac{f}{x}$
4. $y-c x=b x^{2}$
5. $y=\frac{a}{x}+b x$
6. In an experiment the resistance of wire is measured for wires of different diameters with the following results.
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
$R$ (ohms) & 1.64 & 1.14 & 0.89 & 0.76 & 0.63 \\
$d(\mathrm{~mm})$ & 1.10 & 1.42 & 1.75 & 2.04 & 2.56
\end{tabular}

It is thought that $R$ is related to $d$ by the law $R=\frac{a}{d^{2}}+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Verify this and find the approximate values for
$a$ and $b$. Determine the cross-sectional area needed for a resistance reading of 0.50 ohms .
7. Corresponding experimental values of two quantities $x$ and $y$ are given below.
\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
$x$ & 1.5 & 3.0 & 4.5 & 6.0 & 7.5 & 9.0 \\
$y$ & 11.5 & 25.0 & 47.5 & 79.0 & 119.5 & 169.0
\end{tabular}

By plotting a suitable graph, verify that $y$ and $x$ are connected by a law of the form $y=k x^{2}+c$, where $k$ and $c$ are constants. Determine the law of the graph and hence find the value of $x$ when $y$ is 60.0
8. Experimental results of the safe load $L \mathrm{kN}$, applied to girders of varying spans, $d \mathrm{~m}$, are shown below.
\begin{tabular}{lllllll|}
\hline Span, $d(\mathrm{~m})$ & 2.0 & 2.8 & 3.6 & 4.2 & 4.8 \\
Load, $L(\mathrm{kN})$ & 475 & 339 & 264 & 226 & 198
\end{tabular}

It is believed that the relationship between load and span is $L=c / d$, where $c$ is a constant. Determine (a) the value of constant $c$ and (b) the safe load for a span of 3.0 m .
9. The following results give corresponding values of two quantities $x$ and $y$ which are believed to be related by a law of the form $y=a x^{2}+b x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
$x$ & 33.86 & 55.54 & 72.80 & 84.10 & 111.4 & 168.1 \\
$y$ & 3.4 & 5.2 & 6.5 & 7.3 & 9.1 & 12.4
\end{tabular}

Verify the law and determine approximate values of $a$ and $b$. Hence, determine (a) the value of $y$ when $x$ is 8.0 and (b) the value of $x$ when $y$ is 146.5

\subsection*{18.3 Revision of laws of logarithms}

The laws of logarithms were stated in Chapter 15 as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \log (\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B})=\log \mathrm{A}+\log \mathrm{B} \\
& \log \left(\frac{\mathrm{~A}}{\mathrm{~B}}\right)=\log \mathrm{A}-\log \mathrm{B} \\
& \log \mathrm{~A}^{n}=n \times \log \mathrm{A}
\end{aligned}$$

Also, $\quad \ln e=1$ and if, say, $\lg x=1.5$, then $x=10^{1.5}=31.62$

Further, if $3^{x}=7$ then $\lg 3^{x}=\lg 7$ and $x \lg 3=\lg 7$, from which $x=\frac{\lg 7}{\lg 3}=1.771$

These laws and techniques are used whenever non-linear laws of the form $y=a x^{n}, y=a b^{x}$ and $y=a e^{b x}$ are reduced to linear form with the values of $a$ and $b$ needing to be calculated. This is demonstrated in the following section.

\subsection*{18.4 Determination of laws involving logarithms}

Examples of the reduction of equations to linear form involving logarithms include
(a) $y=a x^{n}$

Taking logarithms to a base of $\mathbf{1 0}$ of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\lg y & =\lg \left(a x^{n}\right) \\
& =\lg a+\lg x^{n} \quad \text { by law (1) } \\
\text { i.e. } \quad \lg y & =n \lg x+\lg a \text { by law (3) }
\end{aligned}$$
which compares with $Y=m X+c$
and shows that $\lg y$ is plotted vertically against $\lg x$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\lg \boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $\lg$ a.
See worked Problems 4 and 5 to demonstrate how this law is determined.
(b) $y=a b^{x}$

Taking logarithms to a base of $\mathbf{1 0}$ of both sides gives
$$\begin{array}{lll} 
& \lg y & =\lg \left(a b^{x}\right) \\
\text { i.e. } & & \lg y \\
& =\lg a+\lg b^{x} \quad \text { by law (1) } \\
& & \lg y \\
& =\lg a+x \lg b \quad \text { by law (3) } \\
\text { i.e. } & & \lg y \\
\text { or } & =x \lg b+\lg a \\
& \lg y & =(\lg b) x+\lg a
\end{array}$$
which compares with
$$Y=m X+c$$
and shows that $\lg \boldsymbol{y}$ is plotted vertically against $\boldsymbol{x}$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $\lg b$ and $\lg y$-axis intercept $\lg$ a.
See worked Problem 6 to demonstrate how this law is determined.
(c) $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{e}^{\boldsymbol{b x}}$

Taking logarithms to a base of $\boldsymbol{e}$ of both sides
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\text { gives } & \ln y=\ln \left(a e^{b x}\right) & \\
\text { i.e. } & \ln y=\ln a+\ln e^{b x} & \text { by law (1) } \\
\text { i.e. } & \ln y=\ln a+b x \ln e & \text { by law (3) } \\
\text { i.e. } & \ln y=b x+\ln a & \text { since } \ln e=1
\end{array}$$
which compares with
$$Y=m X+c$$
and shows that $\ln \boldsymbol{y}$ is plotted vertically against $\boldsymbol{x}$ horizontally to produce a straight line graph of gradient $\boldsymbol{b}$ and $\ln \boldsymbol{y}$-axis intercept $\ln$ a.
See worked Problem 7 to demonstrate how this law is determined.

Problem 4. The current flowing in, and the power dissipated by, a resistor are measured experimentally for various values and the results are as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\hline Current, $I$ (amperes) & 2.2 & 3.6 & 4.1 & 5.6 & 6.8 \\
\hline Power, $P$ (watts) & 116 & 311 & 403 & 753 & 1110
\end{tabular}

Show that the law relating current and power is of the form $P=R I^{n}$, where $R$ and $n$ are constants, and determine the law

Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of $P=R I^{n}$ gives
$$\lg P=\lg \left(R I^{n}\right)=\lg R+\lg I^{n}=\lg R+n \lg I$$
by the laws of logarithms
i.e. $\quad \lg P=n \lg I+\lg R$
which is of the form $Y=m X+c$,
showing that $\lg P$ is to be plotted vertically against $\lg I$ horizontally.
A table of values for $\lg I$ and $\lg P$ is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|llllll|}
\hline$I$ & 2.2 & 3.6 & 4.1 & 5.6 & 6.8 \\
\hline $\lg I$ & 0.342 & 0.556 & 0.613 & 0.748 & 0.833 \\
\hline$P$ & 116 & 311 & 403 & 753 & 1110 \\
\hline $\lg P$ & 2.064 & 2.493 & 2.605 & 2.877 & 3.045 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of $\lg P$ against $\lg I$ is shown in Figure 18.4 and, since a straight line results, the law $P=R I^{\boldsymbol{n}}$ is verified.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-164.jpg?height=603&width=711&top_left_y=444&top_left_x=1114)

Figure 18.4
$$\text { Gradient of straight line, } \begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{n} & =\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{2.98-2.18}{0.8-0.4} \\
& =\frac{0.80}{0.4}=\mathbf{2}
\end{aligned}$$

It is not possible to determine the vertical axis intercept on sight since the horizontal axis scale does not start at zero. Selecting any point from the graph, say point $D$, where $\lg I=0.70$ and $\lg P=2.78$ and substituting values into
$$\lg P=n \lg I+\lg R$$
gives
$$2.78=(2)(0.70)+\lg R$$
from which,
$$\lg R=2.78-1.40=1.38$$

Hence,
$$\boldsymbol{R}=\operatorname{antilog} 1.38=10^{1.38}=\mathbf{2 4 . 0}$$

Hence, the law of the graph is $\boldsymbol{P}=\mathbf{2 4 . 0} \boldsymbol{I}^{\mathbf{2}}$
Problem 5. The periodic time, $T$, of oscillation of a pendulum is believed to be related to its length, $L$, by a law of the form $T=k L^{n}$, where $k$ and $n$ are constants. Values of $T$ were measured for various lengths of the pendulum and the results are as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|llllllll|}
\hline Periodic time, $T(\mathrm{~s})$ & 1.0 & 1.3 & 1.5 & 1.8 & 2.0 & 2.3 \\
\hline Length, $L(\mathrm{~m})$ & 0.25 & 0.42 & 0.56 & 0.81 & 1.0 & 1.32 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Show that the law is true and determine the approximate values of $k$ and $n$. Hence find the periodic time when the length of the pendulum is 0.75 m

From para (a), page 150, if $\quad T=k L^{n}$
then
and comparing with
$$\lg T=n \lg L+\lg k$$
$$Y=m X+c$$
shows that $\lg T$ is plotted vertically against $\lg L$ horizontally, with gradient $n$ and vertical-axis intercept $\lg k$.
A table of values for $\lg T$ and $\lg L$ is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{lllllll|}
\hline$T$ & 1.0 & 1.3 & 1.5 & 1.8 & 2.0 & 2.3 \\
\hline $\lg T$ & 0 & 0.114 & 0.176 & 0.255 & 0.301 & 0.362 \\
\hline$L$ & 0.25 & 0.42 & 0.56 & 0.81 & 1.0 & 1.32 \\
$\lg L$ & -0.602 & -0.377 & -0.252 & -0.092 & 0 & 0.121 \\

Figure 18.5
From the graph, gradient of straight line, $\boldsymbol{n}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{0.25-0.05}{-0.10-(-0.50)}=\frac{0.20}{0.40}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}$
Vertical axis intercept, $\lg k=0.30$. Hence, $\boldsymbol{k}=\operatorname{antilog} 0.30=10^{0.30}=\mathbf{2 . 0}$

Hence, the law of the graph is $T=2.0 L^{1 / 2}$ or $T=2.0 \sqrt{L}$.
When length $L=0.75 \mathrm{~m}, \mathbf{T}=2.0 \sqrt{0.75}=\mathbf{1 . 7 3} \mathrm{s}$

Problem 6. Quantities $x$ and $y$ are believed to be related by a law of the form $y=a b^{x}$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The values of $x$ and corresponding values of $y$ are

\end{tabular}

Verify the law and determine the approximate values of $a$ and $b$. Hence determine (a) the value of $y$ when $x$ is 2.1 and (b) the value of $x$ when $y$ is 100

From para (b), page 150, if $\quad y=a b^{x}$
then
$$\begin{aligned}
\lg y & =(\lg b) x+\lg a \\
Y & =m X+c

and comparing with
shows that $\lg y$ is plotted vertically and $x$ horizontally, with gradient $\lg b$ and vertical-axis intercept $\lg a$.
Another table is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|lllcccc|}

Figure 18.6

Gradient of straight line,
$\lg \boldsymbol{b}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{2.13-1.17}{3.0-1.0}=\frac{0.96}{2.0}=0.48$
Hence, $\boldsymbol{b}=\operatorname{antilog} 0.48=10^{0.48}=\mathbf{3 . 0}$, correct to 2 significant figures.

Vertical axis intercept, $\lg a=0.70$, from which
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{a} & =\operatorname{antilog} 0.70 \\
& =10^{0.70}=\mathbf{5 . 0}, \text { correct to } \\
& 2 \text { significant figures. }
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the law of the graph is $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{5 . 0 ( 3 . 0})^{\boldsymbol{x}}$
(a) When $x=2.1, \boldsymbol{y}=5.0(3.0)^{2.1}=\mathbf{5 0 . 2}$
(b) When $y=100,100=5.0(3.0)^{x}$, from which $100 / 5.0=(3.0)^{x}$
i.e. $\quad 20=(3.0)^{x}$

Taking logarithms of both sides gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\lg 20 & =\lg (3.0)^{x}=x \lg 3.0 \\
\text { Hence, } \boldsymbol{x} & =\frac{\lg 20}{\lg 3.0}=\frac{1.3010}{0.4771}=\mathbf{2 . 7 3}

Problem 7. The current $i \mathrm{~mA}$ flowing in a capacitor which is being discharged varies with time $t \mathrm{~ms}$, as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
$i(\mathrm{~mA})$ & 203 & 61.14 & 22.49 & 6.13 & 2.49 & 0.615 \\
$t(\mathrm{~ms})$ & 100 & 160 & 210 & 275 & 320 & 390
\end{tabular}

Show that these results are related by a law of the form $i=I e^{t / T}$, where $I$ and $T$ are constants. Determine the approximate values of $I$ and $T$

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides of
$$\begin{aligned}
& \qquad \begin{aligned}
i & =I e^{t / T} \\
\text { gives } \quad \begin{array}{l}

& \ln i=\ln I+\frac{t}{T} \text { since } \ln e=1 \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { anich compares with } \quad y=\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) t+\ln I

Another table of values is drawn up as shown below.

A graph of $\ln i$ against $t$ is shown in Figure 18.7 and, since a straight line results, the law $i=I \boldsymbol{e}^{\boldsymbol{t} / T}$ is verified.

Figure 18.7

Gradient of straight line, $\quad \frac{1}{T}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{5.30-1.30}{100-300}$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{4.0}{-200}=-0.02 \\
\boldsymbol{T} & =\frac{1}{-0.02}=\mathbf{- 5 0}
\end{aligned}$$

Selecting any point on the graph, say point $D$, where $t=200$ and $\ln i=3.31$, and substituting
into
$$\ln i=\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) t+\ln I$$
gives
$$3.31=-\frac{1}{50}(200)+\ln I$$
from which, $\quad \ln I=3.31+4.0=7.31$
and $\quad \boldsymbol{I}=\operatorname{antilog} 7.31=e^{7.31}=1495$ or $\mathbf{1 5 0 0}$
correct to 3 significant figures.
Hence, the law of the graph is $i=1500 e^{-t / 50}$

\section*{Graphical solution of equations}

\subsection*{19.1 Graphical solution of simultaneous equations}

Linear simultaneous equations in two unknowns may be solved graphically by
(a) plotting the two straight lines on the same axes, and
(b) noting their point of intersection.

The co-ordinates of the point of intersection give the required solution.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the graphical solution of simultaneous equations.

Problem 1. Solve graphically the simultaneous equations
$$\begin{array}{r}
2 x-y=4 \\
x+y=5
\end{array}$$

Rearranging each equation into $y=m x+c$ form gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& y=2 x-4 \\
& y=-x+5
\end{aligned}$$

Only three co-ordinates need be calculated for each graph since both are straight lines.
\begin{tabular}{|lrrr|}
\hline$x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline$y=2 x-4$ & -4 & -2 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|lll|}
\hline$x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline$y=-x+5$ & 5 & 4 & 3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Each of the graphs is plotted as shown in Figure 19.1. The point of intersection is at $(3,2)$ and since this is the only point which lies simultaneously on both lines then $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{2}$ is the solution of the simultaneous equations.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-168.jpg?height=717&width=741&top_left_y=1469&top_left_x=1094)

Figure 19.1
Problem 2. Solve graphically the equations
$$\begin{array}{r}
1.20 x+y=1.80 \\
x-5.0 y=8.50
\end{array}$$

Rearranging each equation into $y=m x+c$ form gives
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
& y=-1.20 x+1.80 \\
& y=\frac{x}{5.0}-\frac{8.5}{5.0} \\
& y=0.20 x-1.70
\end{aligned}$$

Three co-ordinates are calculated for each equation as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|lllc|}
\hline$x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline$y=-1.20 x+1.80$ & 1.80 & 0.60 & -0.60 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|cccc|}
$x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
$y=0.20 x-1.70$ & -1.70 & -1.50 & -1.30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The two sets of co-ordinates are plotted as shown in Figure 19.2. The point of intersection is $(2.50,-1.20)$. Hence, the solution of the simultaneous equations is $x=2.50, y=-1.20$
(It is sometimes useful to initially sketch the two straight lines to determine the region where the point of intersection is. Then, for greater accuracy, a graph having a smaller range of values can be drawn to 'magnify' the point of intersection.)

\subsection*{19.2 Graphical solution of quadratic equations}

A general quadratic equation is of the form $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$, where $a, b$ and $c$ are constants and $a$ is not equal to zero.
A graph of a quadratic equation always produces a shape called a parabola.
The gradients of the curves between 0 and $A$ and between $B$ and $C$ in Figure 19.3 are positive, whilst the gradient between $A$ and $B$ is negative. Points such as $A$ and $B$ are called turning points. At $A$ the gradient is zero and, as $x$ increases, the gradient of the curve changes from positive just before $A$ to negative just after. Such a point is called a maximum value. At $B$ the gradient is also zero and, as $x$ increases, the gradient of the curve changes from negative just before $B$ to positive just after. Such a point is called a minimum value.

Following are three examples of solutions using quadratic graphs.
(a) $y=a x^{2}$

Graphs of $y=x^{2}, y=3 x^{2}$ and $y=\frac{1}{2} x^{2}$ are shown in Figure 19.4. All have minimum values at the origin $(0,0)$.

Graphs of $y=-x^{2}, y=-3 x^{2}$ and $y=-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}$ are shown in Figure 19.5. All have maximum values at the origin $(0,0)$.

(c)

Figure 19.5
When $y=a x^{2}$,
(i) curves are symmetrical about the $y$-axis,
(ii) the magnitude of $a$ affects the gradient of the curve, and
(iii) the sign of $a$ determines whether it has a maximum or minimum value.
(b) $y=a x^{2}+c$

Graphs of $y=x^{2}+3, y=x^{2}-2, y=-x^{2}+2$ and $y=-2 x^{2}-1$ are shown in Figure 19.6.
When $y=a x^{2}+c$,
(i) curves are symmetrical about the $y$-axis,
(ii) the magnitude of $a$ affects the gradient of the curve, and
(iii) the constant $c$ is the $y$-axis intercept.
(c) $y=a x^{2}+b x+c$

Whenever $b$ has a value other than zero the curve is displaced to the right or left of the $y$-axis.
When $b / a$ is positive, the curve is displaced $b / 2 a$ to the left of the $y$-axis, as shown in Figure 19.7(a). When $b / a$ is negative, the curve is displaced $b / 2 a$ to the right of the $y$-axis, as shown in Figure 19.7(b).

Quadratic equations of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ may be solved graphically by
(a) plotting the graph $y=a x^{2}+b x+c$, and
(b) noting the points of intersection on the $x$-axis (i.e. where $y=0$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-170.jpg?height=823&width=758&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=1080)

Figure 19.7
The $x$ values of the points of intersection give the required solutions since at these points both $y=0$ and $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$.
The number of solutions, or roots, of a quadratic equation depends on how many times the curve cuts the $x$-axis. There can be no real roots, as in Figure 19.7(a), one root, as in Figures 19.4 and 19.5, or two roots, as in Figure 19.7(b).
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the graphical solution of quadratic equations.

Problem 3. Solve the quadratic equation $4 x^{2}+4 x-15=0$ graphically, given that the solutions lie in the range $x=-3$ to $x=2$. Determine also the co-ordinates and nature of the turning point of the curve

Let $y=4 x^{2}+4 x-15$. A table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
$x$ \\
$y=4 x^{2}+4 x-15$ & 9 & -7 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
2
\end{tabular}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-171.jpg?height=785&width=744&top_left_y=589&top_left_x=284)

Figure 19.8
A graph of $y=4 x^{2}+4 x-15$ is shown in Figure 19.8. The only points where $y=4 x^{2}+4 x-15$ and $y=0$ are the points marked $A$ and $B$. This occurs at $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 2 . 5}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=1.5$ and these are the solutions of the quadratic equation $4 x^{2}+4 x-15=0$.
By substituting $x=-2.5$ and $x=1.5$ into the original equation the solutions may be checked.
The curve has a turning point at $(-0.5,-16)$ and the nature of the point is a minimum.
An alternative graphical method of solving $4 x^{2}+4 x-15=0$ is to rearrange the equation as $4 x^{2}=-4 x+15$ and then plot two separate graphs - in this case, $y=4 x^{2}$ and $y=-4 x+15$. Their points of intersection give the roots of the equation $4 x^{2}=-4 x+15$, i.e. $4 x^{2}+4 x-15=0$. This is shown in Figure 19.9, where the roots are $x=-2.5$ and $x=1.5$, as before.

Problem 4. Solve graphically the quadratic equation $-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2=0$ given that the solutions lie between $x=-1$ and $x=3$. Determine also the co-ordinates of the turning point and state its nature
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-171.jpg?height=649&width=765&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=1109)

Figure 19.9
Let $y=-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2$. A table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|lcccc|}
\hline$x$ & -1 & -0.5 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline$y=-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2$ & -6.8 & 1.45 & 7.2 & 11.2 \\
\hline$x$ & 2 & 2.5 & 3 \\
\hline$y=-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2$ & 5.2 & -1.55 & -10.8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of $y=-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2$ is shown plotted in Figure 19.10. The graph crosses the $x$-axis (i.e. where $\boldsymbol{y}=0$ ) at $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 0 . 6}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2} .4$ and these are the solutions of the quadratic equation $-5 x^{2}+9 x+7.2=0$. The turning point is a maximum, having co-ordinates (0.9, 11.25).

Problem 5. Plot a graph of $y=2 x^{2}$ and hence solve the equations
(a) $2 x^{2}-8=0$
(b) $2 x^{2}-x-3=0$

A graph of $y=2 x^{2}$ is shown in Figure 19.11.
(a) Rearranging $2 x^{2}-8=0$ gives $2 x^{2}=8$ and the solution of this equation is obtained from the points of intersection of $y=2 x^{2}$ and $y=8$; i.e., at coordinates $(-2,8)$ and $(2,8)$, shown as $A$ and $B$, respectively, in Figure 19.11. Hence, the solutions of $2 x^{2}-8=0$ are $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 2}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{+ 2}$.
(b) Rearranging $2 x^{2}-x-3=0$ gives $2 x^{2}=x+3$ and the solution of this equation is obtained from the points of intersection of $y=2 x^{2}$ and $y=x+3$; i.e., at $C$ and $D$ in Figure 19.11. Hence, the solutions of $2 x^{2}-x-3=0$ are $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1}$ and $x=1.5$

Problem 6. Plot the graph of $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$ for values of $x$ from $x=-2$ to $x=4$. Use the graph to find the roots of the following equations.

(a) The parabola $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$ and the straight line $y=0$ intersect at $A$ and $B$, where $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 1 3}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2 . 6 3}$, and these are the roots of the equation $-2 x^{2}+3 x+6=0$.
(b) Comparing

shows that, if 4 is added to both sides of equation (2), the RHS of both equations will be the same. Hence, $4=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$. The solution of this equation is found from the points of intersection of the line $y=4$ and the parabola $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$; i.e., points $C$ and $D$ in Figure 19.12. Hence, the roots of $-2 x^{2}+3 x+2=0$ are $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 0 . 5}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{2}$.
(c) $-2 x^{2}+3 x+9=0$ may be rearranged as $-2 x^{2}+3 x+6=-3$ and the solution of this equation is obtained from the points of intersection of the line $y=-3$ and the parabola $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$; i.e., at points $E$ and $F$ in Figure 19.12. Hence, the roots of $-2 x^{2}+3 x+9=0$ are $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 5}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$.
(d) Comparing
$$y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$$
with
$$0=-2 x^{2}+x+5$$
shows that, if $2 x+1$ is added to both sides of equation (4), the RHS of both equations will be the same. Hence, equation (4) may be written as $2 x+1=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$. The solution of this equation is found from the points of intersection of the line $y=2 x+1$ and the parabola $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+6$; i.e., points $G$ and $H$ in Figure 19.12. Hence, the roots of $-2 x^{2}+x+5=0$ are $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 3 5}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{1 . 8 5}$

\subsection*{19.3 Graphical solution of linear and quadratic equations simultaneously}

The solution of linear and quadratic equations simultaneously may be achieved graphically by

(b) noting the points of intersection.

The co-ordinates of the points of intersection give the required solutions.
Here is a worked problem to demonstrate the simultaneous solution of a linear and quadratic equation.

Problem 7. Determine graphically the values of $x$ and $y$ which simultaneously satisfy the equations $y=2 x^{2}-3 x-4$ and $y=2-4 x$
$y=2 x^{2}-3 x-4$ is a parabola and a table of values is drawn up as shown below.
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrr|}
\hline$x$ & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
$y$ & 10 & 1 & -4 & -5 & -2 & 5 \\

\end{tabular}

The two graphs are plotted in Figure 19.13 and the points of intersection, shown as $A$ and $B$, are at coordinates $(-2,10)$ and $(1.5,-4)$. Hence, the simultaneous solutions occur when $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 2}, \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{1 0}$ and when $x=1.5, y=-4$.
These solutions may be checked by substituting into each of the original equations.

(b) noting the points of intersection on the $x$-axis (i.e. where $y=0$ ).

The $x$-values of the points of intersection give the required solution since at these points both $y=0$ and $a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d=0$.

The graph crosses the $x$-axis (where $y=0$ ) at $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{- 1 . 5}$, $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{0 . 5}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}=\mathbf{3}$ and these are the solutions to the cubic equation $4 x^{3}-8 x^{2}-15 x+9=0$.

\section*{Chapter 20}

\section*{Angles and triangles}

\subsection*{20.1 Introduction}

Trigonometry is a subject that involves the measurement of sides and angles of triangles and their relationship to each other. This chapter involves the measurement of angles and introduces types of triangle.

\subsection*{20.2 Angular measurement}

An angle is the amount of rotation between two straight lines. Angles may be measured either in degrees or in radians.
If a circle is divided into 360 equal parts, then each part is called $\mathbf{1}$ degree and is written as $\mathbf{1}^{\circ}$
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { i.e. } & \mathbf{1} \text { revolution }=360^{\circ} \\
\text { or } & \mathbf{1} \text { degree is } \frac{1}{360} \text { th of a revolution }
\end{array}$$

Some angles are given special names.
- Any angle between $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ is called an acute angle.
- An angle equal to $90^{\circ}$ is called a right angle.
- Any angle between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ is called an obtuse angle.
- Any angle greater than $180^{\circ}$ and less than $360^{\circ}$ is called a reflex angle.
- An angle of $180^{\circ}$ lies on a straight line.
- If two angles add up to $90^{\circ}$ they are called complementary angles.
- If two angles add up to $180^{\circ}$ they are called supplementary angles.
- Parallel lines are straight lines which are in the same plane and never meet. Such lines are denoted by arrows, as in Figure 20.1.
- A straight line which crosses two parallel lines is called a transversal (see $M N$ in Figure 20.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-178.jpg?height=462&width=516&top_left_y=1046&top_left_x=1209)

Figure 20.1

With reference to Figure 20.1,
(a) $a=c, b=d, e=g$ and $f=h$. Such pairs of angles are called vertically opposite angles.
(b) $\quad a=e, b=f, c=g$ and $d=h$. Such pairs of angles are called corresponding angles.
(c) $c=e$ and $b=h$. Such pairs of angles are called alternate angles.
(d) $b+e=180^{\circ}$ and $c+h=180^{\circ}$. Such pairs of angles are called interior angles.

\subsection*{20.2.1 Minutes and seconds}

One degree may be sub-divided into 60 parts, called minutes.
i.e.
$$1 \text { degree = } 60 \text { minutes }$$
which is written as $\quad \mathbf{1}^{\circ}=\mathbf{6 0}^{\prime}$.

41 degrees and 29 minutes is written as $41^{\circ} 29^{\prime} .41^{\circ} 29^{\prime}$ is equivalent to $41 \frac{29^{\circ}}{60}=41.483^{\circ}$ as a decimal, correct to 3 decimal places by calculator.
1 minute further subdivides into 60 seconds,
i.e.
$$1 \text { minute }=60 \text { seconds }$$
which is written as
$$1^{\prime}=60^{\prime \prime} .$$
(Notice that for minutes, 1 dash is used and for seconds, 2 dashes are used.)
For example, 56 degrees, 36 minutes and 13 seconds is written as $56^{\circ} 36^{\prime} 13^{\prime \prime}$.

\subsection*{20.2.2 Radians and degrees}

One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius. (For more on circles, see Chapter 26.)
With reference to Figure 20.2, for arc length $s$, $\theta$ radians $=\frac{s}{r}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-179.jpg?height=465&width=462&top_left_y=1297&top_left_x=423)

Figure 20.2

When $s$ is the whole circumference, i.e. when $s=2 \pi r$,
$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}=\frac{2 \pi r}{r}=2 \pi$$

In one revolution, $\theta=360^{\circ}$. Hence, the relationship between degrees and radians is
$$360^{\circ}=2 \pi \text { radians or } \mathbf{1 8 0} \mathbf{0}^{\circ}=\boldsymbol{\pi} \mathbf{r a d}$$
i.e. $\quad 1 \mathbf{r a d}=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi} \approx 57.30^{\circ}$

Here are some worked examples on angular measurement.

Problem 1. Evaluate $43^{\circ} 29^{\prime}+27^{\circ} 43^{\prime}$
$$\begin{array}{r}
43^{\circ} 29^{\prime} \\
+\quad \frac{27^{\circ} 43^{\prime}}{} \begin{array}{c}
71^{\circ} 12^{\prime} \\
\hline 1^{\circ}
\end{array}
\end{array}$$
(i) $29^{\prime}+43^{\prime}=72^{\prime}$
(ii) Since $60^{\prime}=1^{\circ}, 72^{\prime}=1^{\circ} 12^{\prime}$
(iii) The $12^{\prime}$ is placed in the minutes column and $1^{\circ}$ is carried in the degrees column.
(iv) $43^{\circ}+27^{\circ}+1^{\circ}($ carried $)=71^{\circ}$. Place $71^{\circ}$ in the degrees column.

This answer can be obtained using the calculator as follows.
1. Enter 43
2. Press ${ }^{\circ}$,,
3. Enter 29
4. Press ${ }^{\circ}$, , ,
5. Press +
6. Enter 27
7. Press ${ }^{\circ}$, ,
8. Enter 43
9. Press ${ }^{\circ}$,, ,
10. Press $=\quad$ Answer $=71^{\circ} \mathbf{1 2}^{\prime}$

Thus, $\mathbf{4 3}^{\circ} \mathbf{2 9}^{\prime}+\mathbf{2 7}^{\circ} \mathbf{4 3}^{\prime}=\mathbf{7 1}^{\circ} 12^{\prime}$.
Problem 2. Evaluate $84^{\circ} 13^{\prime}-56^{\circ} 39^{\prime}$
$$\begin{array}{r}
84^{\circ} 13^{\prime} \\
-\quad 56^{\circ} 39^{\prime} \\
\hline 27^{\circ} 34^{\prime} \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
(i) $13^{\prime}-39^{\prime}$ cannot be done.
(ii) $1^{\circ}$ or $60^{\prime}$ is 'borrowed' from the degrees column, which leaves $83^{\circ}$ in that column.
(iii) $\left(60^{\prime}+13^{\prime}\right)-39^{\prime}=34^{\prime}$, which is placed in the minutes column.
(iv) $83^{\circ}-56^{\circ}=27^{\circ}$, which is placed in the degrees column.

This answer can be obtained using the calculator as follows.
1. Enter 84
2. Press ${ }^{\circ}$,,
3. Enter 13
4. Press ${ }^{\circ}$, , ,
5. Press -
6. Enter 56
7. Press ${ }^{\circ}$, ,
8. Enter 39
9. Press ${ }^{\circ}$,,
10. Press $=\quad$ Answer $=27^{\circ} 34^{\prime}$

Thus, $84^{\circ} 13^{\prime}-\mathbf{5 6}^{\circ} \mathbf{3 9} 9^{\prime}=\mathbf{2 7}^{\circ} 34^{\prime}$.
Problem 3. Evaluate $19^{\circ} 51^{\prime} 47^{\prime \prime}+63^{\circ} 27^{\prime} 34^{\prime \prime}$
$$\begin{array}{r}
19^{\circ} 51^{\prime} 47^{\prime \prime} \\
+\frac{63^{\circ} 27^{\prime} 34^{\prime \prime}}{} \frac{83^{\circ} 19^{\prime} 21^{\prime \prime}}{1^{\circ} 1^{\prime}}
\end{array}$$
(i) $47^{\prime \prime}+34^{\prime \prime}=81^{\prime \prime}$
(ii) Since $60^{\prime \prime}=1^{\prime}, 81^{\prime \prime}=1^{\prime} 21^{\prime \prime}$

Problem 7. State the general name given to the following angles: (a) $157^{\circ}$ (b) $49^{\circ}$ (c) $90^{\circ}$ (d) $245^{\circ}$
(a) Any angle between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ is called an obtuse angle.
Thus, $157^{\circ}$ is an obtuse angle.
(b) Any angle between $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ is called an acute angle.

Thus, $49^{\circ}$ is an acute angle.
(c) An angle equal to $90^{\circ}$ is called a right angle.
(d) Any angle greater than $180^{\circ}$ and less than $360^{\circ}$ is called a reflex angle.
Thus, $245^{\circ}$ is a reflex angle.

\section*{Problem 8. Find the angle complementary to $48^{\circ} 39^{\prime}$}

If two angles add up to $90^{\circ}$ they are called complementary angles. Hence, the angle complementary to $48^{\circ} 39^{\prime}$ is
$$90^{\circ}-48^{\circ} 39^{\prime}=\mathbf{4 1}^{\circ} \mathbf{2 1} \mathbf{1}^{\prime}$$

Problem 9. Find the angle supplementary to $74^{\circ} 25^{\prime}$

If two angles add up to $180^{\circ}$ they are called supplementary angles. Hence, the angle supplementary to $74^{\circ} 25^{\prime}$ is
$$180^{\circ}-74^{\circ} 25^{\prime}=\mathbf{1 0 5}^{\circ} \mathbf{3 5}^{\prime}$$

Problem 10. Evaluate angle $\theta$ in each of the diagrams shown in Figure 20.3

Figure 20.3
(a) The symbol shown in Figure 20.4 is called a right angle and it equals $90^{\circ}$.

Figure 20.4
Hence, from Figure 20.3(a),
$$\begin{aligned}
\theta+41^{\circ} & =90^{\circ} \\
\text { from which, } \quad \boldsymbol{\theta} & =90^{\circ}-41^{\circ}=\mathbf{4 9 ^ { \circ }}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) An angle of $180^{\circ}$ lies on a straight line. Hence, from Figure 20.3(b),
$$\begin{aligned}
180^{\circ} & =53^{\circ}+\theta+44^{\circ} \\
\text { from which, } \quad \boldsymbol{\theta} & =180^{\circ}-53^{\circ}-44^{\circ}=\mathbf{8 3}^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 11. Evaluate angle $\theta$ in the diagram shown in Figure 20.5

Figure 20.5

There are $360^{\circ}$ in a complete revolution of a circle.
Thus, $360^{\circ}=58^{\circ}+108^{\circ}+64^{\circ}+39^{\circ}+\theta$
from which, $\theta=360^{\circ}-58^{\circ}-108^{\circ}-64^{\circ}-39^{\circ}=91^{\circ}$

Problem 12. Two straight lines $A B$ and $C D$ intersect at 0 . If $\angle A O C$ is $43^{\circ}$, find $\angle A O D$, $\angle D O B$ and $\angle B O C$

From Figure 20.6, $\angle A O D$ is supplementary to $\angle A O C$.
Hence, $\angle A O D=180^{\circ}-43^{\circ}=137^{\circ}$.
When two straight lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles are equal.
Hence, $\quad \angle D O B=43^{\circ}$ and $\angle B O C 137^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-181.jpg?height=283&width=660&top_left_y=2044&top_left_x=1161)

Figure 20.7
$\alpha=180^{\circ}-133^{\circ}=47^{\circ}$ (i.e. supplementary angles). $\alpha=\beta=47^{\circ}$ (corresponding angles between parallel lines).

Problem 14. Determine the value of angle $\theta$ in Figure 20.8
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-182.jpg?height=210&width=460&top_left_y=1213&top_left_x=399)

Figure 20.8

Let a straight line $F G$ be drawn through $E$ such that $F G$ is parallel to $A B$ and $C D$.
$\angle B A E=\angle A E F$ (alternate angles between parallel lines $A B$ and $F G$ ), hence $\angle A E F=23^{\circ} 37^{\prime}$.
$\angle E C D=\angle F E C$ (alternate angles between parallel lines $F G$ and $C D$ ), hence $\angle F E C=35^{\circ} 49^{\prime}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Angle } \boldsymbol{\theta}=\angle A E F+\angle F E C & =23^{\circ} 37^{\prime}+35^{\circ} 49^{\prime} \\
& =\mathbf{5 9}^{\circ} \mathbf{2 6}^{\prime}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. Determine angles $c$ and $d$ in Figure 20.9
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-182.jpg?height=261&width=405&top_left_y=2120&top_left_x=427)

Figure 20.9
$a=b=46^{\circ}$ (corresponding angles between parallel lines).
Also, $b+c+90^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ (angles on a straight line).
Hence, $46^{\circ}+c+90^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$, from which, $c=44^{\circ}$. $b$ and $d$ are supplementary, hence $\boldsymbol{d}=180^{\circ}-46^{\circ}$
$$=134^{\circ} .$$

Alternatively, $90^{\circ}+c=d$ (vertically opposite angles).

Problem 16. Convert the following angles to radians, correct to 3 decimal places.
(a) $73^{\circ}$ (b) $25^{\circ} 37^{\prime}$

Although we may be more familiar with degrees, radians is the SI unit of angular measurement in engineering ( 1 radian $\approx 57.3^{\circ}$ ).
(a) Since $180^{\circ}=\pi \mathrm{rad}$ then $1^{\circ}=\frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad}$.

Hence, $\mathbf{7 3}^{\circ}=73 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad}=\mathbf{1 . 2 7 4} \mathbf{r a d}$.
(b) $25^{\circ} 37^{\prime}=25 \frac{37^{\circ}}{60}=25.616666 \ldots$

Hence, $\quad \mathbf{2 5}^{\circ} \mathbf{3 7} \mathbf{7}^{\prime}=25.616666 \ldots{ }^{\circ}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =25.616666 \ldots \times \frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad} \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 4 4 7} \mathbf{r a d} .
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 17. Convert 0.743 rad to degrees and minutes

Since $180^{\circ}=\pi \mathrm{rad}$ then $1 \mathrm{rad}=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}$
Hence, $\mathbf{0 . 7 4 3} \mathbf{r a d}=0.743 \times \frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}=42.57076 \ldots \circ$
$$=42^{\circ} 34^{\prime}$$

Since $\pi \mathrm{rad}=180^{\circ}$, then $\frac{\pi}{2} \mathrm{rad}=90^{\circ}, \frac{\pi}{4} \mathrm{rad}=45^{\circ}$, $\frac{\pi}{3} \mathrm{rad}=60^{\circ}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6} \mathrm{rad}=30^{\circ}$

\subsection*{20.3 Triangles}

A triangle is a figure enclosed by three straight lines. The sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to $180^{\circ}$.

\subsection*{20.3.1 Types of triangle}

An acute-angled triangle is one in which all the angles are acute; i.e., all the angles are less than $90^{\circ}$. An example is shown in triangle $A B C$ in Figure 20.15(a). A right-angled triangle is one which contains a right angle; i.e., one in which one of the angles is $90^{\circ}$. An example is shown in triangle $D E F$ in Figure 20.15(b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-184.jpg?height=416&width=771&top_left_y=923&top_left_x=244)

Figure 20.15
An obtuse-angled triangle is one which contains an obtuse angle; i.e., one angle which lies between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$. An example is shown in triangle $P Q R$ in Figure 20.16(a).
An equilateral triangle is one in which all the sides and all the angles are equal; i.e., each is $60^{\circ}$. An example is shown in triangle $A B C$ in Figure 20.16(b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-184.jpg?height=353&width=788&top_left_y=1738&top_left_x=238)

Figure 20.16
An isosceles triangle is one in which two angles and two sides are equal. An example is shown in triangle $E F G$ in Figure 20.17(a).
A scalene triangle is one with unequal angles and therefore unequal sides. An example of an acute angled scalene triangle is shown in triangle $A B C$ in Figure 20.17(b).

Figure 20.18
With reference to Figure 20.18,
(a) Angles $A, B$ and $C$ are called interior angles of the triangle.
(b) Angle $\theta$ is called an exterior angle of the triangle and is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles; i.e., $\theta=A+C$.
(c) $a+b+c$ is called the perimeter of the triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-184.jpg?height=503&width=318&top_left_y=1891&top_left_x=1305)

Figure 20.19

A right-angled triangle $A B C$ is shown in Figure 20.19. The point of intersection of two lines is called a vertex (plural vertices); the three vertices of the triangle are labelled as $A, B$ and $C$, respectively. The right angle is angle $C$. The side opposite the right angle is given the special name of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse, length $A B$ in Figure 20.19, is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle. With reference to angle $B, A C$ is the opposite side and $B C$ is called the adjacent side. With reference to angle $A, B C$ is the opposite side and $A C$ is the adjacent side.
Often sides of a triangle are labelled with lower case letters, $a$ being the side opposite angle $A, b$ being the side opposite angle $B$ and $c$ being the side opposite angle $C$. So, in the triangle $A B C$, length $A B=c$, length $B C=a$ and length $A C=b$. Thus, $c$ is the hypotenuse in the triangle $A B C$.
$\angle$ is the symbol used for 'angle'. For example, in the triangle shown, $\angle C=90^{\circ}$. Another way of indicating an angle is to use all three letters. For example, $\angle A B C$ actually means $\angle B$; i.e., we take the middle letter as the angle. Similarly, $\angle B A C$ means $\angle A$ and $\angle A C B$ means $\angle C$.
Here are some worked examples to help us understand more about triangles.

Problem 18. Name the types of triangle shown in Figure 20.20
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-185.jpg?height=451&width=720&top_left_y=1529&top_left_x=291)

Figure 20.20
(a) Equilateral triangle (since all three sides are equal).
(b) Acute-angled scalene triangle (since all the angles are less than $90^{\circ}$ ).
(c) Right-angled triangle $\left(39^{\circ}+51^{\circ}=90^{\circ}\right.$; hence, the third angle must be $90^{\circ}$, since there are $180^{\circ}$ in a triangle).
(d) Obtuse-angled scalene triangle (since one of the angles lies between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ ).
(e) Isosceles triangle (since two sides are equal).

Problem 19. In the triangle $A B C$ shown in Figure 20.21, with reference to angle $\theta$, which side is the adjacent?

Figure 20.21

The triangle is right-angled; thus, side $A C$ is the hypotenuse. With reference to angle $\theta$, the opposite side is $B C$. The remaining side, $\boldsymbol{A B}$, is the adjacent side.

Problem 20. In the triangle shown in
Figure 20.22, determine angle $\theta$

Figure 20.22

The sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to $180^{\circ}$.
The triangle is right-angled. Hence,
$90^{\circ}+56^{\circ}+\angle \theta=180^{\circ}$
from which, $\quad \angle \boldsymbol{\theta}=180^{\circ}-90^{\circ}-56^{\circ}=34^{\circ}$.

Problem 21. Determine the value of $\theta$ and $\alpha$ in Figure 20.23
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-186.jpg?height=308&width=540&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=362)

Figure 20.23

In triangle $A B C, \angle A+\angle B+\angle C=180^{\circ}$ (the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ ).
Hence, $\angle C=180^{\circ}-90^{\circ}-62^{\circ}=28^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle D C E=28^{\circ}$ (vertically opposite angles).
$\theta=\angle D C E+\angle D E C$ (the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles).
Hence, $\angle \boldsymbol{\theta}=28^{\circ}+15^{\circ}=\mathbf{4 3}^{\circ}$.
$\angle \alpha$ and $\angle D E C$ are supplementary; thus, $\alpha=180^{\circ}-15^{\circ}=165^{\circ}$.

Problem 22. $A B C$ is an isosceles triangle in which the unequal angle $B A C$ is $56^{\circ} . A B$ is extended to $D$ as shown in Figure 20.24. Find, for the triangle, $\angle A B C$ and $\angle A C B$. Also, calculate $\angle D B C$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-186.jpg?height=338&width=310&top_left_y=1374&top_left_x=477)

Figure 20.24

Since triangle $A B C$ is isosceles, two sides - i.e. $A B$ and $A C$ - are equal and two angles - i.e. $\angle A B C$ and $\angle A C B$ are equal.
The sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to $180^{\circ}$. Hence, $\angle A B C+\angle A C B=180^{\circ}-56^{\circ}=124^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle A B C=\angle A C B$ then $\angle A B C=\angle A C B=\frac{124^{\circ}}{2}=62^{\circ}$.
An angle of $180^{\circ}$ lies on a straight line; hence, $\angle A B C+\angle D B C=180^{\circ}$ from which, $\angle D B C=180^{\circ}-\angle A B C=180^{\circ}-62^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 1 8}^{\circ}$.
Alternatively, $\angle D B C=\angle A+\angle C$ (exterior angle equals sum of two interior opposite angles), i.e. $\angle D B C=56^{\circ}+62^{\circ}=118^{\circ}$.

$\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{6} \mathbf{2}^{\circ}$ and $\boldsymbol{c}=\mathbf{5 5}^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines).
$55^{\circ}+b+62^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ (angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ ); hence, $\boldsymbol{b}=180^{\circ}-55^{\circ}-62^{\circ}=63^{\circ}$.
$b=\boldsymbol{d}=\mathbf{6 3}{ }^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines).
$e+55^{\circ}+63^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ (angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ ); hence, $\boldsymbol{e}=180^{\circ}-55^{\circ}-63^{\circ}=62^{\circ}$.
Check: $e=a=62^{\circ}$ (corresponding angles between parallel lines).

\subsection*{20.4 Congruent triangles}

Two triangles are said to be congruent if they are equal in all respects; i.e., three angles and three sides in one triangle are equal to three angles and three sides in the other triangle. Two triangles are congruent if
(a) the three sides of one are equal to the three sides of the other (SSS),
(b) two sides of one are equal to two sides of the other and the angles included by these sides are equal (SAS),
(c) two angles of the one are equal to two angles of the other and any side of the first is equal to the corresponding side of the other (ASA), or
(d) their hypotenuses are equal and one other side of one is equal to the corresponding side of the other (RHS).

Problem 24. State which of the pairs of triangles shown in Figure 20.35 are congruent and name their sequence

(b) Congruent GIH, JLK (side, angle, side; i.e., SAS).

(d) Not necessarily congruent. It is not indicated that any side coincides.
(e) Congruent $A B C, F E D$ (side, side, side; i.e., SSS).

Problem 25. In Figure 20.36, triangle $P Q R$ is isosceles with $Z$, the mid-point of $P Q$. Prove that triangles $P X Z$ and $Q Y Z$ are congruent and that triangles $R X Z$ and $R Y Z$ are congruent. Determine the values of angles $R P Z$ and $R X Z$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-189.jpg?height=237&width=757&top_left_y=597&top_left_x=283)

Figure 20.36

Since triangle $P Q R$ is isosceles, $P R=R Q$ and thus $\angle Q P R=\angle R Q P$.
$\angle R X Z=\angle Q P R+28^{\circ}$ and $\angle R Y Z=\angle R Q P+28^{\circ}$ (exterior angles of a triangle equal the sum of the two interior opposite angles). Hence, $\angle R X Z=\angle R Y Z$.
$\angle P X Z=180^{\circ}-\angle R X Z$ and $\angle Q Y Z=180^{\circ}-\angle R Y Z$. Thus, $\angle P X Z=\angle Q Y Z$.

Triangles $P X Z$ and $Q Y Z$ are congruent since $\angle X P Z=\angle Y Q Z, P Z=Z Q$ and $\angle X Z P=\angle Y Z Q$ (ASA). Hence, $X Z=Y Z$.

Triangles $P R Z$ and $Q R Z$ are congruent since $P R=R Q, \quad \angle R P Z=\angle R Q Z \quad$ and $\quad P Z=Z Q \quad$ (SAS). Hence, $\angle R Z X=\angle R Z Y$.

Triangles $R X Z$ and $R Y Z$ are congruent since $\angle R X Z=\angle R Y Z, X Z=Y Z$ and $\angle R Z X=\angle R Z Y$ (ASA). $\angle Q R Z=67^{\circ}$ and thus $\angle P R Q=67^{\circ}+67^{\circ}=134^{\circ}$.
Hence, $\angle \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{P} Z=\angle R Q Z=\frac{180^{\circ}-134^{\circ}}{2}=\mathbf{2 3}^{\circ}$. $\angle \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{X Z}=23^{\circ}+28^{\circ}=\mathbf{5 1}^{\circ}$ (external angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two interior opposite angles).

\subsection*{20.5 Similar triangles}

Two triangles are said to be similar if the angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of the other triangle. With reference to Figure 20.38, triangles $A B C$ and $P Q R$ are similar and the corresponding sides are in proportion to each other,
i.e.
$$\frac{p}{a}=\frac{q}{b}=\frac{r}{c}$$

Figure 20.39

In triangle $A B C, 50^{\circ}+70^{\circ}+\angle C=180^{\circ}$, from which $\angle C=60^{\circ}$.
In triangle $D E F, \angle E=180^{\circ}-50^{\circ}-60^{\circ}=70^{\circ}$. Hence, triangles $A B C$ and $D E F$ are similar, since their angles are the same. Since corresponding sides are in proportion to each other,
$$\frac{a}{d}=\frac{c}{f} \quad \text { i.e. } \quad \frac{a}{4.42}=\frac{12.0}{5.0}$$

In triangle $X Y Z, \angle X=180^{\circ}-90^{\circ}-55^{\circ}=35^{\circ}$.
Hence, triangles $P Q R$ and $Z Y X$ are similar since their angles are the same. The triangles may he redrawn as shown in Figure 20.41.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-190.jpg?height=321&width=740&top_left_y=2082&top_left_x=261)

Figure 20.41

By proportion: $\frac{p}{z}=\frac{r}{x}=\frac{q}{y}$
i.e. $\quad \frac{p}{12.97}=\frac{r}{7.44}=\frac{6.82}{10.63}$
from which, $\quad r=7.44\left(\frac{6.82}{10.63}\right)=4.77 \mathrm{~cm}$
By proportion: $\frac{p}{z}=\frac{q}{y} \quad$ i.e. $\quad \frac{p}{12.97}=\frac{6.82}{10.63}$

Figure 20.42

Since $B D$ is parallel to $A E$ then $\angle C B D=\angle C A E$ and $\angle C D B=\angle C E A$ (corresponding angles between parallel lines). Also, $\angle C$ is common to triangles $C B D$ and CAE.
Since the angles in triangle $C B D$ are the same as in triangle $C A E$, the triangles are similar. Hence,
by proportion: $\frac{C B}{C A}=\frac{C D}{C E}\left(=\frac{B D}{A E}\right)$
i.e. $\quad \frac{9}{6+9}=\frac{C D}{12}$, from which
$$C D=12\left(\frac{9}{15}\right)=7.2 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Also,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{9}{15}=\frac{B D}{10}, \text { from which } \\

Problem 29. A rectangular shed 2 m wide and 3 m high stands against a perpendicular building of height 5.5 m . A ladder is used to gain access to the roof of the building. Determine the minimum distance between the bottom of the ladder and the shed

A side view is shown in Figure 20.43, where $A F$ is the minimum length of the ladder. Since $B D$ and $C F$ are parallel, $\angle A D B=\angle D F E$ (corresponding angles between parallel lines). Hence, triangles $B A D$ and $E D F$ are similar since their angles are the same.
$$A B=A C-B C=A C-D E=5.5-3=2.5 \mathrm{~m}$$

By proportion: $\quad \frac{A B}{D E}=\frac{B D}{E F} \quad$ i.e. $\quad \frac{2.5}{3}=\frac{2}{E F}$
Hence, $E F=2\left(\frac{3}{2.5}\right)=\mathbf{2 . 4} \mathbf{m}=$ minimum distance

Here are some worked problems to demonstrate triangle construction.

Problem 30. Construct a triangle whose sides are $6 \mathrm{~cm}, 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and 3 cm

With reference to Figure 20.47:
(i) Draw a straight line of any length and, with a pair of compasses, mark out 6 cm length and label it $A B$.
(ii) Set compass to 5 cm and with centre at $A$ describe $\operatorname{arc} D E$.
(iii) Set compass to 3 cm and with centre at $B$ describe $\operatorname{arc} F G$.
(iv) The intersection of the two curves at $C$ is the vertex of the required triangle. Join $A C$ and $B C$ by straight lines.

It may be proved by measurement that the ratio of the angles of a triangle is not equal to the ratio of the sides (i.e., in this problem, the angle opposite the 3 cm side is not equal to half the angle opposite the 6 cm side).

Problem 31. Construct a triangle $A B C$ such that $a=6 \mathrm{~cm}, b=3 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $\angle C=60^{\circ}$

With reference to Figure 20.50:
(i) Draw a straight line 5 cm long and label it $X Y$.
(ii) Produce $X Y$ any distance to $B$. With compass centred at $X$ make an arc at $A$ and $A^{\prime}$. (The length $X A$ and $X A^{\prime}$ is arbitrary.) With compass centred at $A$ draw the arc $P Q$. With the same compass setting and centred at $A^{\prime}$, draw the arc $R S$. Join the intersection of the arcs, $C$ to $X$, and a right angle to $X Y$ is produced at $X$. (Alternatively, a protractor can be used to construct a $90^{\circ}$ angle.)
(iii) The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle. Thus, $Y Z$ is opposite $\angle X$. Using a compass
centred at $Y$ and set to 6.5 cm , describe the $\operatorname{arc} U V$.
(iv) The intersection of the arc $U V$ with $X C$ produced, forms the vertex $Z$ of the required triangle. Join $Y Z$ with a straight line.

\section*{Chapter 21}

\section*{Introduction to trigonometry}

\subsection*{21.1 Introduction}

Trigonometry is a subject that involves the measurement of sides and angles of triangles and their relationship to each other.

The theorem of Pythagoras and trigonometric ratios are used with right-angled triangles only. However, there are many practical examples in engineering where knowledge of right-angled triangles is very important.

In this chapter, three trigonometric ratios - i.e. sine, cosine and tangent - are defined and then evaluated using a calculator. Finally, solving right-angled triangle problems using Pythagoras and trigonometric ratios is demonstrated, together with some practical examples involving angles of elevation and depression.

\subsection*{21.2 The theorem of Pythagoras}

The theorem of Pythagoras states:
In any right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
In the right-angled triangle $A B C$ shown in Figure 21.1, this means
$$b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}$$

Figure 21.1

If the lengths of any two sides of a right-angled triangle are known, the length of the third side may be calculated by Pythagoras' theorem.

From equation (1): $\quad b=\sqrt{a^{2}+c^{2}}$
Transposing equation (1) for $a$ gives $a^{2}=b^{2}-c^{2}$, from which $a=\sqrt{b^{2}-c^{2}}$
Transposing equation (1) for $c$ gives $c^{2}=b^{2}-a^{2}$, from which $c=\sqrt{b^{2}-a^{2}}$
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the theorem of Pythagoras.

Problem 1. In Figure 21.2, find the length of $B C$

Figure 21.2
From Pythagoras, $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
a^{2} & =4^{2}+3^{2} \\
& =16+9=25
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$a=\sqrt{25}=5 \mathrm{~cm} .$$
$\sqrt{25}= \pm 5$ but in a practical example like this an answer of $a=-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ has no meaning, so we take only the positive answer.

Thus
$$a=B C=5 \mathrm{~cm} .$$
$P Q R$ is a $3,4,5$ triangle. There are not many rightangled triangles which have integer values (i.e. whole numbers) for all three sides.

Problem 2. In Figure 21.3, find the length of $E F$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-195.jpg?height=172&width=367&top_left_y=554&top_left_x=470)

Figure 21.3

By Pythagoras' theorem, $\quad e^{2}=d^{2}+f^{2}$
Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
13^{2} & =d^{2}+5^{2} \\
169 & =d^{2}+25 \\
d^{2} & =169-25=144
\end{aligned}$$

Thus,
$$d=\sqrt{144}=12 \mathrm{~cm}$$
i.e.
$$d=E F=12 \mathrm{~cm}$$

DEF is a 5, 12, 13 triangle, another right-angled triangle which has integer values for all three sides.

Problem 3. Two aircraft leave an airfield at the same time. One travels due north at an average speed of $300 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ and the other due west at an average speed of $220 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. Calculate their distance apart after 4 hours

After 4 hours, the first aircraft has travelled
$$4 \times 300=1200 \mathrm{~km} \text { due north }$$
and the second aircraft has travelled

From Pythagoras' theorem,
and
$$\begin{aligned}
B C^{2} & =1200^{2}+880^{2} \\
& =1440000+774400=2214400 \\
B C & =\sqrt{2214400}=1488 \mathrm{~km} .
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, distance apart after 4 hours $=1488 \mathrm{~km}$.

\subsection*{21.3 Sines, cosines and tangents}

With reference to angle $\theta$ in the right-angled triangle $A B C$ shown in Figure 21.9,
$$\operatorname{sine} \theta=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { hypotenuse }}$$
'Sine' is abbreviated to 'sin', thus $\sin \theta=\frac{B C}{A C}$

Figure 21.9
$$\text { Also, } \operatorname{cosine} \theta=\frac{\text { adjacent side }}{\text { hypotenuse }}$$
'Cosine' is abbreviated to 'cos', thus $\cos \boldsymbol{\theta}=\frac{\boldsymbol{A B}}{\boldsymbol{A C}}$ Finally, tangent $\theta=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { adjacent side }}$
'Tangent' is abbreviated to 'tan', thus $\tan \theta=\frac{\boldsymbol{B C}}{\boldsymbol{A B}}$
These three trigonometric ratios only apply to rightangled triangles. Remembering these three equations is very important and the mnemonic 'SOH CAH TOA' is one way of remembering them.
$\mathbf{S O H}$ indicates $\underline{\sin }=\underline{\mathbf{o p p}}$ posite $\div \underline{\text { hypotenuse }}$
$\mathbf{C A H}$ indicates $\underline{\mathbf{c o s}}=\underline{\mathbf{a} d j a c e n t} \div \underline{\text { hypotenuse }}$

i.e.
$$A C^{2}=3.47^{2}+4.62^{2}$$
from which
$$A C=\sqrt{3.47^{2}+4.62^{2}}=\mathbf{5 . 7 7 8} \mathrm{cm}$$

\subsection*{21.4 Evaluating trigonometric ratios of acute angles}

The easiest way to evaluate trigonometric ratios of any angle is to use a calculator. Use a calculator to check the following (each correct to 4 decimal places).
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\sin 29^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 4 8 4 8} & \sin 53.62^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 8 0 5 1} \\
\cos 67^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 3 9 0 7} & \cos 83.57^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 1 1 2 0} \\
\tan 34^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 6 7 4 5} & \tan 67.83^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 . 4 5 4 1}
\end{array}$$
$\sin 67^{\circ} 43^{\prime}=\sin 67{\frac{43^{\circ}}{60}}_{60}=\sin 67.7166666 \ldots{ }^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 9 2 5 3}$
$\cos 13^{\circ} 28^{\prime}=\cos 13 \frac{28^{\circ}}{60}=\cos 13.466666 \ldots \circ=\mathbf{0 . 9 7 2 5}$
$\tan 56^{\circ} 54^{\prime}=\tan 56 \frac{54^{\circ}}{60}=\tan 56.90^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 . 5 3 4 0}$
If we know the value of a trigonometric ratio and need to find the angle we use the inverse function on our calculators. For example, using shift and $\sin$ on our calculator gives $\sin ^{-1}$ (
If, for example, we know the sine of an angle is 0.5 then the value of the angle is given by
$$\sin ^{-1} 0.5=\mathbf{3 0 ^ { \circ }}\left(\text { Check that } \sin 30^{\circ}=0.5\right)$$

Similarly, if
$$\cos \theta=0.4371 \text { then } \theta=\cos ^{-1} 0.4371=\mathbf{6 4 . 0 8}^{\circ}$$
and if
$$\tan A=3.5984 \text { then } A=\tan ^{-1} 3.5984=74.47^{\circ}$$
each correct to 2 decimal places.
Use your calculator to check the following worked problems.

Problem 8. Determine, correct to 4 decimal places, $\sin 43^{\circ} 39^{\prime}$
$$\sin 43^{\circ} 39^{\prime}=\sin 43 \frac{39^{\circ}}{60}=\sin 43.65^{\circ}=\mathbf{0 . 6 9 0 3}$$

This answer can be obtained using the calculator as follows:
1. Press sin
2. Enter 43
3. Press ${ }^{\circ} "$
4. Enter 39
5. Press ${ }^{\circ}$ "
6. Press )
7. Press $=$
Answer $=\mathbf{0 . 6 9 0 2 5 1 2} \ldots$

Problem 9. Determine, correct to 3 decimal places, $6 \cos 62^{\circ} 12^{\prime}$
$6 \cos 62^{\circ} 12^{\prime}=6 \cos 62 \frac{12}{60}^{\circ}=6 \cos 62.20^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 . 7 9 8}$
This answer can be obtained using the calculator as follows:
1. Enter 6
2. Press cos
3. Enter 62
4. Press ${ }^{\circ} "$
5. Enter 12
6. Press ${ }^{\circ} "$
7. Press )
8. Press $=$ Answer $=\mathbf{2 . 7 9 8 3 1 9} \ldots$

Problem 10. Evaluate sin 1.481, correct to 4 significant figures
$\sin 1.481$ means the sine of 1.481 radians. (If there is no degrees sign, i.e. ${ }^{\circ}$, then radians are assumed). Therefore a calculator needs to be on the radian function.
Hence, $\sin 1.481=\mathbf{0 . 9 9 6 0}$

Problem 11. Evaluate $\cos (3 \pi / 5)$, correct to 4 significant figures

As in Problem 10, $3 \pi / 5$ is in radians.
Hence, $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }}(\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{\pi} / \mathbf{5})=\cos 1.884955 \ldots=\mathbf{- 0 . 3 0 9 0}$
Since, from page $166, \pi$ radians $=180^{\circ}$, $3 \pi / 5 \mathrm{rad}=\frac{3}{5} \times 180^{\circ}=108^{\circ}$.
i.e. $3 \pi / 5 \mathrm{rad}=108^{\circ}$. Check with your calculator that $\cos 108^{\circ}=\mathbf{- 0 . 3 0 9 0}$

Problem 12. Evaluate tan 2.93, correct to 4 significant figures

Again, since there is no degrees sign, 2.93 means 2.93 radians.
Hence, $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \mathbf{2 . 9 3}=\mathbf{- 0 . 2 1 4 8}$
It is important to know when to have your calculator on either degrees mode or radian mode. A lot of mistakes can arise from this if we are not careful.

Problem 13. Find the acute angle $\sin ^{-1} 0.4128$ in degrees, correct to 2 decimal places
$\sin ^{-1} 0.4128$ means 'the angle whose sine is 0.4128 '. Using a calculator,
1. Press shift
2. Press sin
3. Enter 0.4128
4. Press )
5. Press $=$

The answer 24.380848... is displayed.
Hence, $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }}^{\mathbf{- 1}} \mathbf{0 . 4 1 2 8}=\mathbf{2 4 . 3 8}{ }^{\circ}$ correct to 2 decimal places.

Problem 14. Find the acute angle $\cos ^{-1} 0.2437$ in degrees and minutes
$\cos ^{-1} 0.2437$ means 'the angle whose cosine is 0.2437 '. Using a calculator,
1. Press shift
2. Press cos
3. Enter 0.2437
4. Press )
5. Press $=$

The answer $75.894979 \ldots$ is displayed.
6. Press ${ }^{\circ} " \prime$ and $75^{\circ} 53^{\prime} 41.93^{\prime \prime}$ is displayed.

Hence, $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }}^{\boldsymbol{- 1}} \mathbf{0 . 2 4 3 7}=\mathbf{7 5 . 8 9}{ }^{\circ}=\mathbf{7 7}^{\circ} 54^{\prime}$ correct to the nearest minute.

Problem 15. Find the acute angle $\tan ^{-1} 7.4523$ in degrees and minutes
$\tan ^{-1} 7.4523$ means 'the angle whose tangent is 7.4523 '. Using a calculator,
1. Press shift
2. Press tan
3. Enter 7.4523
4. Press )
5. Press $=$

The answer 82.357318... is displayed.
6. Press ${ }^{\circ} " \prime$ and $82^{\circ} 21^{\prime} 26.35^{\prime \prime}$ is displayed.

Hence, $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }}^{\mathbf{- 1}} \mathbf{7 . 4 5 2 3}=\mathbf{8 2 . 3 6}{ }^{\circ}=\mathbf{8 2}^{\circ} \mathbf{2 1}^{\prime}$ correct to the nearest minute.

Problem 16. In triangle $E F G$ in Figure 21.16, calculate angle $G$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-200.jpg?height=137&width=448&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=405)

Figure 21.16

With reference to $\angle G$, the two sides of the triangle given are the opposite side $E F$ and the hypotenuse $E G$; hence, sine is used,
$$\begin{array}{lrl} 
& & \sin G
\end{array}=\frac{2.30}{8.71}=0.26406429 \ldots .$$

Problem 17. Evaluate the following expression, correct to 3 significant figures
$$\frac{4.2 \tan 49^{\circ} 26^{\prime}-3.7 \sin 66^{\circ} 1^{\prime}}{7.1 \cos 29^{\circ} 34^{\prime}}$$

By calculator:
$$\begin{aligned}
\tan 49^{\circ} 26^{\prime} & =\tan \left(49 \frac{26}{60}\right)^{\circ}=1.1681 \\
\sin 66^{\circ} 1^{\prime} & =0.9137 \text { and } \cos 29^{\circ} 34^{\prime}=0.8698
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\frac{4.2 \tan 49^{\circ} 26^{\prime}-3.7 \sin 66^{\circ} 1^{\prime}}{7.1 \cos 29^{\circ} 34^{\prime}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{(4.2 \times 1.1681)-(3.7 \times 0.9137)}{(7.1 \times 0.8698)} \\
& =\frac{4.9060-3.3807}{6.1756}=\frac{1.5253}{6.1756} \\
& =0.2470=\mathbf{0 . 2 4 7}

correct to 3 significant figures.

\subsection*{21.5 Solving right-angled triangles}
'Solving a right-angled triangle' means 'finding the unknown sides and angles'. This is achieved using
(a) the theorem of Pythagoras and/or
(b) trigonometric ratios.

Six pieces of information describe a triangle completely; i.e., three sides and three angles. As long as at least three facts are known, the other three can usually be calculated.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the solution of right-angled triangles.

Problem 18. In the triangle $A B C$ shown in Figure 21.19, find the lengths $A C$ and $A B$

Figure 21.19

There is usually more than one way to solve such a triangle.

In triangle $A B C$,
$$\tan 42^{\circ}=\frac{A C}{B C}=\frac{A C}{6.2}$$
(Remember SOH CAH TOA)
Transposing gives
$$\boldsymbol{A C}=6.2 \tan 42^{\circ}=\mathbf{5 . 5 8 3} \mathbf{~ m m}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\cos 42^{\circ}=\frac{B C}{A B} & =\frac{6.2}{A B}, \text { from which } \\
A B & =\frac{6.2}{\cos 42^{\circ}}=\mathbf{8 . 3 4 3} \mathbf{~ m m}
\end{aligned}$$

Alternatively, by Pythagoras, $A B^{2}=A C^{2}+B C^{2}$ from which $\boldsymbol{A B}=\sqrt{A C^{2}+B C^{2}}=\sqrt{5.583^{2}+6.2^{2}}$
$$=\sqrt{69.609889}=8.343 \mathrm{~mm}$$

Problem 19. Sketch a right-angled triangle $A B C$ such that $B=90^{\circ}, A B=5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $B C=12 \mathrm{~cm}$. Determine the length of $A C$ and hence evaluate $\sin A, \cos C$ and $\tan A$

Triangle $A B C$ is shown in Figure 21.20.

Figure 21.20
By Pythagoras' theorem, $\quad A C=\sqrt{5^{2}+12^{2}}=13$
By definition: $\sin A=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { hypotenuse }}=\frac{12}{13}$ or $\mathbf{0 . 9 2 3 1}$
and
$$\begin{array}{r}
\text { (Remember SOH CAH TOA) } \\
\cos C=\frac{\text { adjacent side }}{\text { hypotenuse }}=\frac{12}{13} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 9 2 3 1} \\
\tan A=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { adjacent side }}=\frac{12}{5} \text { or } \mathbf{2 . 4 0 0}
\end{array}$$

Problem 20. In triangle $P Q R$ shown in Figure 21.21, find the lengths of $P Q$ and $P R$

Figure 21.21
$\tan 38^{\circ}=\frac{P Q}{Q R}=\frac{P Q}{7.5}$, hence
$$P Q=7.5 \tan 38^{\circ}=7.5(0.7813)=\mathbf{5 . 8 6 0} \mathbf{~ c m}$$
$\cos 38^{\circ}=\frac{Q R}{P R}=\frac{7.5}{P R}$, hence
$$P R=\frac{7.5}{\cos 38^{\circ}}=\frac{7.5}{0.7880}=\mathbf{9 . 5 1 8} \mathbf{c m}$$

Check: using Pythagoras' theorem, $(7.5)^{2}+(5.860)^{2}=90.59=(9.518)^{2}$.

Problem 21. Solve the triangle $A B C$ shown in Figure 21.22
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-202.jpg?height=164&width=348&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=458)

Figure 21.22
To 'solve the triangle $A B C$ ' means 'to find the length $A C$ and angles $B$ and $C^{\prime}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\sin C=\frac{35}{37} & =0.94595, \text { hence } \\
\boldsymbol{C} & =\sin ^{-1} 0.94595=\mathbf{7 1 . 0 8}^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$
$\boldsymbol{B}=180^{\circ}-90^{\circ}-71.08^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 8 . 9 2}^{\circ}$ (since the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ )
$$\begin{aligned}
\sin B & =\frac{A C}{37}, \text { hence } \\
\boldsymbol{A C} & =37 \sin 18.92^{\circ}=37(0.3242)=\mathbf{1 2 . 0} \mathbf{~ m m}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 22. Solve triangle $X Y Z$ given $\angle X=90^{\circ}, \angle Y=23^{\circ} 17^{\prime}$ and $Y Z=20.0 \mathrm{~mm}$

It is always advisable to make a reasonably accurate sketch so as to visualize the expected magnitudes of unknown sides and angles. Such a sketch is shown in Figure 21.23.

\subsection*{21.6 Angles of elevation and depression}

If, in Figure 21.27, $B C$ represents horizontal ground and $A B$ a vertical flagpole, the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole, $A$, from the point $C$ is the angle that the imaginary straight line $A C$ must be raised (or elevated) from the horizontal $C B$; i.e., angle $\theta$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-204.jpg?height=204&width=397&top_left_y=1449&top_left_x=433)

Figure 21.28
If, in Figure 21.28, $P Q$ represents a vertical cliff and $R$ a ship at sea, the angle of depression of the ship from point $P$ is the angle through which the imaginary straight line $P R$ must be lowered (or depressed) from the horizontal to the ship; i.e., angle $\phi$. (Note, $\angle P R Q$ is also $\phi$ - alternate angles between parallel lines.)

Problem 23. An electricity pylon stands on horizontal ground. At a point 80 m from the base of the pylon, the angle of elevation of the top of the
pylon is $23^{\circ}$. Calculate the height of the pylon to the nearest metre

Figure 21.29 shows the pylon $A B$ and the angle of elevation of $A$ from point $C$ is $23^{\circ}$.

Figure 21.29
$$\tan 23^{\circ}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{A B}{80}$$

Hence, height of pylon $A B=80 \tan 23^{\circ}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =80(0.4245)=33.96 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =\mathbf{3 4} \mathbf{m} \text { to the nearest metre. }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 24. A surveyor measures the angle of elevation of the top of a perpendicular building as $19^{\circ}$. He moves 120 m nearer to the building and finds the angle of elevation is now $47^{\circ}$. Determine the height of the building

The building $P Q$ and the angles of elevation are shown in Figure 21.30.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-204.jpg?height=275&width=563&top_left_y=1408&top_left_x=1183)

Figure 21.30
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { In triangle } P Q S, \tan 19^{\circ} & =\frac{h}{x+120} \\
& \text { Hence, } \quad \begin{aligned}
h & =\tan 19^{\circ}(x+120) \\
\text { i.e. } h & =0.3443(x+120)
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

In triangle $P Q R, \tan 47^{\circ}=\frac{h}{x}$
Hence, $\quad h=\tan 47^{\circ}(x)$ i.e. $h=1.0724 x$
Equating equations (1) and (2) gives
$$\begin{aligned}
0.3443(x+120) & =1.0724 x \\
0.3443 x+(0.3443)(120) & =1.0724 x \\
(0.3443)(120) & =(1.0724-0.3443) x \\
41.316 & =0.7281 x \\
x & =\frac{41.316}{0.7281}=56.74 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (2), height of building, $\boldsymbol{h}=1.0724 x=1.0724(56.74)=\mathbf{6 0 . 8 5} \mathbf{m}$.

Problem 25. The angle of depression of a ship viewed at a particular instant from the top of a 75 m vertical cliff is $30^{\circ}$. Find the distance of the ship from the base of the cliff at this instant. The ship is sailing away from the cliff at constant speed and 1 minute later its angle of depression from the top of the cliff is $20^{\circ}$. Determine the speed of the ship in km/h

Figure 21.31 shows the cliff $A B$, the initial position of the ship at $C$ and the final position at $D$. Since the angle of depression is initially $30^{\circ}, \angle A C B=30^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-205.jpg?height=283&width=587&top_left_y=1057&top_left_x=360)

Figure 21.31
$\tan 30^{\circ}=\frac{A B}{B C}=\frac{75}{B C}$ hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
B C & =\frac{75}{\tan 30^{\circ}} \\
& =\mathbf{1 2 9 . 9 \mathbf { m } = \text { initial position }} \quad \mathbf{o f ~ s h i p ~ f r o m ~ b a s e ~ o f ~ c l i f f ~}
\end{aligned}$$

In triangle $A B D$,
$$\tan 20^{\circ}=\frac{A B}{B D}=\frac{75}{B C+C D}=\frac{75}{129.9+x}$$

Hence,
$$129.9+x=\frac{75}{\tan 20^{\circ}}=206.06 \mathrm{~m}$$
from which
$$x=206.06-129.9=76.16 \mathrm{~m}$$

Thus, the ship sails 76.16 m in 1 minute; i.e., 60 s ,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Hence, speed of ship }=\frac{\text { distance }}{\text { time }}=\frac{76.16}{60} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =\frac{76.16 \times 60 \times 60}{60 \times 1000} \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}=4.57 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{22.1 Graphs of trigonometric functions}

By drawing up tables of values from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$, graphs of $y=\sin A, y=\cos A$ and $y=\tan A$ may be plotted. Values obtained with a calculator (correct to 3 decimal places - which is more than sufficient for plotting graphs), using $30^{\circ}$ intervals, are shown below, with the respective graphs shown in Figure 22.1.

\subsection*{22.2 Angles of any magnitude}

Figure 22.2 shows rectangular axes $X X^{\prime}$ and $Y Y^{\prime}$ intersecting at origin 0 . As with graphical work, measurements made to the right and above 0 are positive, while those to the left and downwards are negative.

Let $0 A$ be free to rotate about 0 . By convention, when $0 A$ moves anticlockwise angular measurement is considered positive, and vice versa.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-209.jpg?height=500&width=590&top_left_y=789&top_left_x=356)

Figure 22.2

Let $0 A$ be rotated anticlockwise so that $\theta_{1}$ is any angle in the first quadrant and let perpendicular $A B$ be constructed to form the right-angled triangle $0 A B$ in Figure 22.3. Since all three sides of the triangle are positive, the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent will all be positive in the first quadrant. (Note: $O A$ is always positive since it is the radius of a circle.)

Let $0 A$ be further rotated so that $\theta_{2}$ is any angle in the second quadrant and let $A C$ be constructed to form the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-209.jpg?height=495&width=641&top_left_y=1911&top_left_x=330)

Figure 22.3
right-angled triangle $0 A C$. Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \sin \theta_{2}=\frac{+}{+}=+\quad \cos \theta_{2}=\frac{-}{+}=- \\
& \tan \theta_{2}=\frac{+}{-}=-
\end{aligned}$$

Let $0 A$ be further rotated so that $\theta_{3}$ is any angle in the third quadrant and let $A D$ be constructed to form the right-angled triangle $0 A D$. Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \sin \theta_{3}=\frac{-}{+}=-\quad \cos \theta_{3}=\frac{-}{+}=- \\
& \tan \theta_{3}=\frac{-}{-}=+
\end{aligned}$$

Let $0 A$ be further rotated so that $\theta_{4}$ is any angle in the fourth quadrant and let $A E$ be constructed to form the right-angled triangle $0 A E$. Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \sin \theta_{4}=\frac{-}{+}=-\quad \cos \theta_{4}=\frac{+}{+}=+ \\
& \tan \theta_{4}=\frac{-}{+}=-
\end{aligned}$$

The above results are summarized in Figure 22.4, in which all three trigonometric ratios are positive in the first quadrant, only sine is positive in the second quadrant, only tangent is positive in the third quadrant and only cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant.
The underlined letters in Figure 22.4 spell the word CAST when starting in the fourth quadrant and moving in an anticlockwise direction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-209.jpg?height=505&width=576&top_left_y=1627&top_left_x=1198)

Figure 22.4

It is seen that, in the first quadrant of Figure 22.1, all of the curves have positive values; in the second only sine is positive; in the third only tangent is positive; and in the fourth only cosine is positive - exactly as summarized in Figure 22.4.

A knowledge of angles of any magnitude is needed when finding, for example, all the angles between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$ whose sine is, say, 0.3261 . If 0.3261 is entered into a calculator and then the inverse sine key pressed (or $\sin ^{-1} \mathrm{key}$ ) the answer $19.03^{\circ}$ appears. However, there is a second angle between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$ which the calculator does not give. Sine is also positive in the second quadrant (either from CAST or from Figure 22.1(a)). The other angle is shown in Figure 22.5 as angle $\theta$, where $\theta=180^{\circ}-19.03^{\circ}=160.97^{\circ}$. Thus, $19.03^{\circ}$ and $160.97^{\circ}$ are the angles between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$ whose sine is 0.3261 (check that $\sin 160.97^{\circ}=0.3261$ on your calculator).

Figure 22.5
Be careful! Your calculator only gives you one of these answers. The second answer needs to be deduced from a knowledge of angles of any magnitude, as shown in the following worked problems.

Problem 1. Determine all of the angles between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$ whose sine is -0.4638

The angles whose sine is -0.4638 occur in the third and fourth quadrants since sine is negative in these quadrants - see Figure 22.6.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-210.jpg?height=354&width=601&top_left_y=1911&top_left_x=326)

Figure 22.6

From Figure 22.7, $\theta=\sin ^{-1} 0.4638=27.63^{\circ}$. Measured from $0^{\circ}$, the two angles between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$
whose sine is -0.4638 are $180^{\circ}+27.63^{\circ}$ i.e. $\mathbf{2 0 7 . 6 3}^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}-27.63^{\circ}$, i.e. $332.37^{\circ}$. (Note that if a calculator is used to determine $\sin ^{-1}(-0.4638)$ it only gives one answer: $-27.632588^{\circ}$.)

\subsection*{22.3 The production of sine and cosine waves}

In Figure 22.11, let $O R$ be a vector 1 unit long and free to rotate anticlockwise about 0 . In one revolution a circle is produced and is shown with $15^{\circ}$ sectors. Each radius arm has a vertical and a horizontal component. For example, at $30^{\circ}$, the vertical component is $T S$ and the horizontal component is $O S$.

From triangle $O S T$,
$$\sin 30^{\circ}=\frac{T S}{T O}=\frac{T S}{1} \quad \text { i.e. } \quad T S=\sin 30^{\circ}$$
and $\quad \cos 30^{\circ}=\frac{O S}{T O}=\frac{O S}{1}$ i.e. $O S=\cos 30^{\circ}$

Figure 22.12

\subsection*{22.3.1 Sine waves}

The vertical component $T S$ may be projected across to $T^{\prime} S^{\prime}$, which is the corresponding value of $30^{\circ}$ on the graph of $y$ against angle $x^{\circ}$. If all such vertical components as $T S$ are projected on to the graph, a sine wave is produced as shown in Figure 22.11.

\subsection*{22.3.2 Cosine waves}

If all horizontal components such as $O S$ are projected on to a graph of $y$ against angle $x^{\circ}$, a cosine wave is produced. It is easier to visualize these projections by redrawing the circle with the radius arm $O R$ initially in a vertical position as shown in Figure 22.12.
It is seen from Figures 22.11 and 22.12 that a cosine curve is of the same form as the sine curve but is displaced by $90^{\circ}$ (or $\pi / 2$ radians). Both sine and cosine waves repeat every $360^{\circ}$.

\subsection*{22.4 Terminology involved with sine and cosine waves}

Sine waves are extremely important in engineering, with examples occurring with alternating currents and voltages - the mains supply is a sine wave - and with simple harmonic motion.

\subsection*{22.4.1 Cycle}

When a sine wave has passed through a complete series of values, both positive and negative, it is said to have completed one cycle. One cycle of a sine wave is shown in Figure 22.1(a) on page 195 and in Figure 22.11.

\subsection*{22.4.2 Amplitude}

The amplitude is the maximum value reached in a half cycle by a sine wave. Another name for amplitude is peak value or maximum value.

A sine wave $y=5 \sin x$ has an amplitude of 5 , a sine wave $v=200 \sin 314 t$ has an amplitude of 200 and the sine wave $y=\sin x$ shown in Figure 22.11 has an amplitude of 1 .

\subsection*{22.4.3 Period}

The waveforms $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$ repeat themselves every $360^{\circ}$. Thus, for each, the period is $360^{\circ}$. A waveform of $y=\tan x$ has a period of $180^{\circ}$ (from Figure 22.1(c)).
A graph of $y=3 \sin 2 A$, as shown in Figure 22.13, has an amplitude of 3 and period $180^{\circ}$.
A graph of $y=\sin 3 A$, as shown in Figure 22.14, has an amplitude of $\mathbf{1}$ and period of $120^{\circ}$.
A graph of $y=4 \cos 2 x$, as shown in Figure 22.15, has an amplitude of 4 and a period of $180^{\circ}$.
In general, if $y=A \sin p x$ or $y=A \cos p x$, amplitude $=A$ and period $=\frac{360^{\circ}}{p}$

\subsection*{22.4.4 Periodic time}

In practice, the horizontal axis of a sine wave will be time. The time taken for a sine wave to complete one cycle is called the periodic time, $\boldsymbol{T}$.
In the sine wave of voltage $v$ (volts) against time $t$ (milliseconds) shown in Figure 22.17, the amplitude is 10 V and the periodic time is 20 ms ; i.e., $T=20 \mathrm{~ms}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-213.jpg?height=421&width=769&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=1107)

Figure 22.17

\subsection*{22.4.5 Frequency}

The number of cycles completed in one second is called the frequency $f$ and is measured in hertz, Hz.
$$f=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{T} \text { or } T=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{f}$$

Problem 5. Determine the frequency of the sine wave shown in Figure 22.17

In the sine wave shown in Figure 22.17, $T=20 \mathrm{~ms}$, hence
frequency, $f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{20 \times 10^{-3}}=\mathbf{5 0 H z}$
Problem 6. If a waveform has a frequency of 200 kHz , determine the periodic time

If a waveform has a frequency of 200 kHz , the periodic time $T$ is given by
$$\text { periodic time, } \begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{T}=\frac{1}{f} & =\frac{1}{200 \times 10^{3}} \\
& =5 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~s}=\mathbf{5} \mu \mathbf{s}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{22.4.6 Lagging and leading angles}

A sine or cosine curve may not always start at $0^{\circ}$. To show this, a periodic function is represented by $y=A \sin (x \pm \alpha)$ where $\alpha$ is a phase displacement compared with $y=A \sin x$. For example, $y=\sin A$ is shown by the broken line in Figure 22.18 and, on the same axes, $y=\sin \left(A-60^{\circ}\right)$ is shown. The graph $y=\sin \left(A-60^{\circ}\right)$ is said to lag $y=\sin A$ by $60^{\circ}$.
In another example, $y=\cos A$ is shown by the broken line in Figure 22.19 and, on the same axes, $y=$ $\cos \left(A+45^{\circ}\right)$ is shown. The graph $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }}\left(\boldsymbol{A}+\mathbf{4 5 ^ { \circ }}\right)$ is said to lead $y=\cos A$ by $45^{\circ}$.

Problem 7. Sketch $y=5 \sin \left(A+30^{\circ}\right)$ from $A=0^{\circ}$ to $A=360^{\circ}$
$$\text { Amplitude }=\mathbf{5} \text { and period }=360^{\circ} / 1=\mathbf{3 6 0}{ }^{\circ}$$
$5 \sin \left(A+30^{\circ}\right)$ leads $5 \sin A$ by $30^{\circ}$ (i.e. starts $30^{\circ}$ earlier).
A sketch of $y=5 \sin \left(A+30^{\circ}\right)$ is shown in Figure 22.20.

Problem 8. Sketch $y=7 \sin (2 A-\pi / 3)$ in the range $0 \leq A \leq 360^{\circ}$
$$\text { Amplitude }=7 \text { and period }=2 \pi / 2=\pi \text { radians }$$

In general, $y=\sin (p t-\alpha)$ lags $y=\sin p t$ by $\alpha / p$, hence $7 \sin (2 A-\pi / 3)$ lags $7 \sin 2 A$ by $(\pi / 3) / 2$, i.e.
$$\pi / 6 \mathrm{rad} \text { or } 30^{\circ}$$

A sketch of $y=7 \sin (2 A-\pi / 3)$ is shown in Figure 22.21.

\subsection*{22.5 Sinusoidal form: $A \sin (\omega t \pm \alpha)$}

If a sine wave is expressed in the form $y=A \sin (\omega t \pm \alpha)$ then
(a) $\mathrm{A}=$ amplitude.
(b) $\quad \omega=$ angular velocity $=2 \pi f \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.
(c) frequency, $f=\frac{\omega}{2 \pi}$ hertz.
(d) periodic time, $T=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$ seconds (i.e. $\left.T=\frac{1}{f}\right)$.
(e) $\alpha=$ angle of lead or lag (compared with $y=A \sin \omega t)$.

Here are some worked problems involving the sinusoidal form $A \sin (\omega t \pm \alpha)$.

Problem 10. An alternating current is given by $i=30 \sin (100 \pi t+0.35)$ amperes. Find the
(a) amplitude, (b) frequency, (c) periodic time and
(d) phase angle (in degrees and minutes)
(a) $i=30 \sin (100 \pi t+0.35) A$; hence, amplitude $=30 \mathrm{~A}$.
(b) Angular velocity, $\omega=100 \pi, \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, hence
$$\text { frequency, } f=\frac{\omega}{2 \pi}=\frac{100 \pi}{2 \pi}=\mathbf{5 0 H z}$$
(c) Periodic time, $\boldsymbol{T}=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{50}=\mathbf{0 . 0 2} \mathrm{s}$ or $\mathbf{2 0} \mathrm{ms}$.
(d) 0.35 is the angle in radians. The relationship between radians and degrees is
$$360^{\circ}=2 \pi \text { radians or } \mathbf{1 8 0}{ }^{\circ}=\pi \text { radians }$$
from which,
$$\mathbf{1}^{\circ}=\frac{\pi}{\mathbf{1 8 0}} \mathbf{r a d} \text { and } 1 \mathbf{r a d}=\frac{\mathbf{1 8 0}^{\circ}}{\pi}\left(\approx 57.30^{\circ}\right)$$

Hence, phase angle, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=0.35 \mathrm{rad}$ $=\left(0.35 \times \frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 0 . 0 5}{ }^{\circ}$ or $\mathbf{2 0}^{\circ} \mathbf{3}^{\prime}$ leading $i=30 \sin (100 \pi t)$.

Problem 11. An oscillating mechanism has a maximum displacement of 2.5 m and a frequency of 60 Hz . At time $t=0$ the displacement is 90 cm . Express the displacement in the general form $A \sin (\omega t \pm \alpha)$

Amplitude $=$ maximum displacement $=2.5 \mathrm{~m}$.
Angular velocity, $\omega=2 \pi f=2 \pi(60)=120 \pi \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.
Hence, $\quad$ displacement $=2.5 \sin (120 \pi t+\alpha) \mathbf{m}$.
When $t=0$, displacement $=90 \mathrm{~cm}=0.90 \mathrm{~m}$.
hence,
$$0.90=2.5 \sin (0+\alpha)$$
i.e.

Hence,
$$\sin \alpha=\frac{0.90}{2.5}=0.36$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha & =\sin ^{-1} 0.36=21.10^{\circ} \\
& =21^{\circ} 6^{\prime}=0.368 \mathrm{rad}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, displacement $=2.5 \sin (120 \pi t+0.368) \mathrm{m}$.

Problem 12. The instantaneous value of voltage in an a.c. circuit at any time $t$ seconds is given by $v=340 \sin (50 \pi t-0.541)$ volts. Determine the (a) amplitude, frequency, periodic time and phase angle (in degrees), (b) value of the voltage when $t=0$, (c) value of the voltage when $t=10 \mathrm{~ms}$,
(d) time when the voltage first reaches 200 V and
(e) time when the voltage is a maximum. Also,
(f) sketch one cycle of the waveform
(a) Amplitude $=340 \mathrm{~V}$

Angular velocity, $\omega=50 \pi$
Frequency, $f=\frac{\omega}{2 \pi}=\frac{50 \pi}{2 \pi}=\mathbf{2 5} \mathbf{H z}$
Periodic time, $T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{25}=\mathbf{0 . 0 4} \mathrm{s}$ or 40 ms
Phase angle $=0.541 \mathrm{rad}=\left(0.541 \times \frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}$
$=31^{\circ}$ lagging $v=340 \sin (50 \pi t)$
(b) When $\boldsymbol{t}=\mathbf{0}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{v} & =340 \sin (0-0.541) \\
& =340 \sin \left(-31^{\circ}\right)=-\mathbf{1 7 5 . 1} \mathbf{V}
\end{aligned}$$
(c) When $t=10 \mathrm{~ms}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
v & =340 \sin \left(50 \pi \times 10 \times 10^{-3}-0.541\right) \\
& =340 \sin (1.0298) \\
& =340 \sin 59^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 9 1 . 4} \text { volts }
\end{aligned}$$
(d) When $v=200$ volts,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 200=340 \sin (50 \pi t-0.541) \\
& \frac{200}{340}=\sin (50 \pi t-0.541)
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad(50 \pi t-0.541)=\sin ^{-1} \frac{200}{340}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =36.03^{\circ} \text { or } 0.628875 \mathrm{rad} \\
50 \pi t & =0.628875+0.541 \\
& =1.169875
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, when $v=200 \mathrm{~V}$,
time, $t=\frac{1.169875}{50 \pi}=7.448 \mathrm{~ms}$
(e) When the voltage is a maximum, $v=340 \mathrm{~V}$.

Hence $\quad 340=340 \sin (50 \pi t-0.541)$
$$\begin{aligned}
1 & =\sin (50 \pi t-0.541) \\
50 \pi t-0.541 & =\sin ^{-1} 1=90^{\circ} \text { or } 1.5708 \mathrm{rad} \\
50 \pi t & =1.5708+0.541=2.1118
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, time, $t=\frac{2.1118}{50 \pi}=\mathbf{1 3 . 4 4} \mathbf{m s}$
(f) A sketch of $v=340 \sin (50 \pi t-0.541)$ volts is shown in Figure 22.23.

\section*{Non-right-angled triangles and some practical applications}

\subsection*{23.1 The sine and cosine rules}

To 'solve a triangle' means 'to find the values of unknown sides and angles'. If a triangle is right-angled, trigonometric ratios and the theorem of Pythagoras may be used for its solution, as shown in Chapter 21. However, for a non-right-angled triangle, trigonometric ratios and Pythagoras' theorem cannot be used. Instead, two rules, called the sine rule and the cosine rule, are used.

\subsection*{23.1.1 The sine rule}

With reference to triangle $A B C$ of Figure 23.1, the sine rule states
$$\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$$

Figure 23.1

The rule may be used only when
(a) 1 side and any 2 angles are initially given, or
(b) 2 sides and an angle (not the included angle) are initially given.

\subsection*{23.1.2 The cosine rule}

With reference to triangle $A B C$ of Figure 23.1, the cosine rule states
or
$$\begin{aligned}
& a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A \\
& b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2 a c \cos B \\
& c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b \cos C
\end{aligned}$$

The rule may be used only when
(a) 2 sides and the included angle are initially given, or
(b) 3 sides are initially given.

\subsection*{23.2 Area of any triangle}

The area of any triangle such as $A B C$ of Figure 23.1 is given by
(a) $\frac{1}{2} \times$ base $\times$ perpendicular height
or (b) $\frac{1}{2} a b \sin C$ or $\frac{1}{2} a c \sin B$ or $\frac{1}{2} b c \sin A$
or (c) $\sqrt{[s(s-a)(s-\boldsymbol{b})(s-c)]}$ where $s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}$

\subsection*{23.3 Worked problems on the solution of triangles and their areas}

Problem 1. In a triangle $X Y Z, \angle X=51^{\circ}$, $\angle Y=67^{\circ}$ and $Y Z=15.2 \mathrm{~cm}$. Solve the triangle and find its area

The triangle $X Y Z$ is shown in Figure 23.2. Solving the triangle means finding $\angle Z$ and sides $X Z$ and $X Y$.

Since the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$, $Z=180^{\circ}-51^{\circ}-67^{\circ}=62^{\circ}$

Applying the sine rule,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{15.2}{\sin 51^{\circ}} & =\frac{y}{\sin 67^{\circ}} \\
& =\frac{z}{\sin 62^{\circ}} \\
\frac{15.2}{\sin 51^{\circ}} & =\frac{y}{\sin 67^{\circ}}
\end{aligned}$$

Using

$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{y} & =\frac{15.2 \sin 67^{\circ}}{\sin 51^{\circ}} \\
& =\mathbf{1 8 . 0 0} \mathbf{c m}=X \mathbf{Z}
\end{aligned}$$

Using
$$\begin{aligned}

z & =\frac{15.2 \sin 62^{\circ}}{\sin 51^{\circ}} \\
& =\mathbf{1 7 . 2 7} \mathbf{c m}=X Y
\end{aligned}$$
and transposing gives

Area of triangle $X Y Z=\frac{1}{2} x y \sin Z$
$$\begin{gathered}
\qquad \begin{aligned}
&=\frac{1}{2}(15.2)(18.00) \sin 62^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 2 0 . 8} \mathbf{c m}^{2} \\
&\left(\text { or area }=\frac{1}{2} x z \sin Y\right.=\frac{1}{2}(15.2)(17.27) \sin 67^{\circ} \\
&\left.=\mathbf{1 2 0 . 8} \mathbf{c m}^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{gathered}$$

It is always worth checking with triangle problems that the longest side is opposite the largest angle and viceversa. In this problem, $Y$ is the largest angle and $X Z$ is the longest of the three sides.

Problem 2. Solve the triangle $A B C$ given $B=78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}, A C=22.31 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $A B=17.92 \mathrm{~mm}$.
Also find its area

Triangle $A B C$ is shown in Figure 23.3. Solving the triangle means finding angles $A$ and $C$ and side $B C$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-219.jpg?height=324&width=359&top_left_y=806&top_left_x=1315)

Figure 23.3
Applying the sine rule,$\quad \frac{22.31}{\sin 78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}}=\frac{17.92}{\sin C}$
from which $\sin C=\frac{17.92 \sin 78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}}{22.31}=0.7881$
Hence, $\quad C=\sin ^{-1} 0.7881=52^{\circ} 0^{\prime}$ or $128^{\circ} 0^{\prime}$
Since $B=78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}$, $C$ cannot be $128^{\circ} 0^{\prime}$, since $128^{\circ} 0^{\prime}+$ $78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}$ is greater than $180^{\circ}$. Thus, only $\boldsymbol{C}=\mathbf{5 2}^{\circ} \mathbf{0}^{\prime}$ is valid.
Angle $\boldsymbol{A}=180^{\circ}-78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}-52^{\circ} 0^{\prime}=\mathbf{4 9}^{\circ} \mathbf{9}^{\prime}$.
Applying the sine rule, $\quad \frac{a}{\sin 49^{\circ} 9^{\prime}}=\frac{22.31}{\sin 78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}}$
from which $\quad \boldsymbol{a}=\frac{22.31 \sin 49^{\circ} 9^{\prime}}{\sin 78^{\circ} 51^{\prime}}=\mathbf{1 7 . 2 0} \mathbf{m m}$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{A}=\mathbf{4 9 ^ { \circ }} \mathbf{9}^{\prime}, \boldsymbol{C}=\mathbf{5} 2^{\circ} \mathbf{0}^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol{B C}=\mathbf{1 7 . 2 0} \mathrm{mm}$.
$$\text { Area of triangle } \begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B} \boldsymbol{C} & =\frac{1}{2} a c \sin B \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(17.20)(17.92) \sin 78^{\circ} 51^{\prime} \\
& =\mathbf{1 5 1 . 2} \mathbf{m m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 3. Solve the triangle $P Q R$ and find its area given that $Q R=36.5 \mathrm{~mm}, P R=29.6 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $\angle Q=36^{\circ}$

Triangle $P Q R$ is shown in Figure 23.4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-220.jpg?height=253&width=424&top_left_y=362&top_left_x=417)

Figure 23.4
Applying the sine rule, $\frac{29.6}{\sin 36^{\circ}}=\frac{36.5}{\sin P}$ from which $\sin P=\frac{36.5 \sin 36^{\circ}}{29.6}=0.7248$
Hence, $\quad P=\sin ^{-1} 0.7248=46.45^{\circ}$ or $133.55^{\circ}$
When $P=46.45^{\circ}$ and $Q=36^{\circ}$ then
$R=180^{\circ}-46.45^{\circ}-36^{\circ}=97.55^{\circ}$
When $P=133.55^{\circ}$ and $Q=36^{\circ}$ then
$R=180^{\circ}-133.55^{\circ}-36^{\circ}=10.45^{\circ}$
Thus, in this problem, there are two separate sets of results and both are feasible solutions. Such a situation is called the ambiguous case.
Case 1. $P=46.45^{\circ}, Q=36^{\circ}, R=97.55^{\circ}$, $p=36.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $q=29.6 \mathrm{~mm}$
From the sine rule, $\quad \frac{r}{\sin 97.55^{\circ}}=\frac{29.6}{\sin 36^{\circ}}$
from which $\quad r=\frac{29.6 \sin 97.55^{\circ}}{\sin 36^{\circ}}=\mathbf{4 9 . 9 2} \mathrm{mm}=\boldsymbol{P Q}$
Area of $P Q R=\frac{1}{2} p q \sin R=\frac{1}{2}(36.5)(29.6) \sin 97.55^{\circ}$
$$=535.5 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$$

Case 2. $P=133.55^{\circ}, Q=36^{\circ}, R=10.45^{\circ}$, $p=36.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $q=29.6 \mathrm{~mm}$
From the sine rule, $\quad \frac{r}{\sin 10.45^{\circ}}=\frac{29.6}{\sin 36^{\circ}}$
from which $\quad r=\frac{29.6 \sin 10.45^{\circ}}{\sin 36^{\circ}}=\mathbf{9 . 1 3 4} \mathbf{m m}=P Q$
Area of $P Q R=\frac{1}{2} p q \sin R=\frac{1}{2}(36.5)(29.6) \sin 10.45^{\circ}$
$$=97.98 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$$

The triangle $P Q R$ for case 2 is shown in Figure 23.5.

23.4 Further worked problems on the solution of triangles and their areas

Problem 4. Solve triangle $D E F$ and find its area given that $E F=35.0 \mathrm{~mm}, D E=25.0 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $\angle E=64^{\circ}$

Triangle $D E F$ is shown in Figure 23.6. Solving the triangle means finding angles $D$ and $F$ and side $D F$. Since two sides and the angle in between the two sides are given, the cosine needs to be used.

Figure 23.6
Applying the cosine rule, $\quad e^{2}=d^{2}+f^{2}-2 d f \cos E$ i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
e^{2} & =(35.0)^{2}+(25.0)^{2}-\left[2(35.0)(25.0) \cos 64^{\circ}\right] \\
& =1225+625-767.15 \\
& =1082.85
\end{aligned}$$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
e & =\sqrt{1082.85} \\
& =\mathbf{3 2 . 9 1} \mathrm{mm}=\boldsymbol{D F}
\end{aligned}$$

Applying the sine rule, $\quad \frac{32.91}{\sin 64^{\circ}}=\frac{25.0}{\sin F}$ from which $\sin F=\frac{25.0 \sin 64^{\circ}}{32.91}=0.6828$

Thus,
$$\angle F=\sin ^{-1} 0.6828=43^{\circ} 4^{\prime} \text { or } 136^{\circ} 56^{\prime}$$
$F=136^{\circ} 56^{\prime}$ is not possible in this case since $136^{\circ} 56^{\prime}+$ $64^{\circ}$ is greater than $180^{\circ}$. Thus, only $\boldsymbol{F}=\mathbf{4 3}^{\circ} \mathbf{4}^{\prime}$ is valid. Then $\angle \boldsymbol{D}=180^{\circ}-64^{\circ}-43^{\circ} 4^{\prime}=\mathbf{7 2}^{\circ} 56^{\prime}$.
Area of triangle $\boldsymbol{D E F}=\frac{1}{2} d f \sin E$
$$=\frac{1}{2}(35.0)(25.0) \sin 64^{\circ}=\mathbf{3 9 3 . 2} \mathbf{~ m m}^{2}$$

Problem 5. A triangle $A B C$ has sides $a=9.0 \mathrm{~cm}, b=7.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $c=6.5 \mathrm{~cm}$. Determine its three angles and its area

Triangle $A B C$ is shown in Figure 23.7. It is usual first to calculate the largest angle to determine whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. In this case the largest angle is $A$ (i.e. opposite the longest side).

Figure 23.7
Applying the cosine rule, $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A$ from which
$$2 b c \cos A=b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\cos A=\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2 b c} & =\frac{7.5^{2}+6.5^{2}-9.0^{2}}{2(7.5)(6.5)} \\
& =0.1795
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \boldsymbol{A}=\cos ^{-1} 0.1795=79.67^{\circ} \\
& \quad\left(\text { or } 280.33^{\circ},\right. \text { which is clearly impossible) }
\end{aligned}$$

The triangle is thus acute angled since $\cos A$ is positive. (If $\cos A$ had been negative, angle $A$ would be obtuse; i.e., would lie between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$.)

Applying the sine rule, $\quad \frac{9.0}{\sin 79.67^{\circ}}=\frac{7.5}{\sin B}$ from which $\quad \sin B=\frac{7.5 \sin 79.67^{\circ}}{9.0}=0.8198$

Hence,
$$\boldsymbol{B}=\sin ^{-1} 0.8198=\mathbf{5 5 . 0}^{\circ}$$
and
$$C=180^{\circ}-79.67^{\circ}-55.07^{\circ}=\mathbf{4 5 . 2 6}^{\circ}$$

Area $=\sqrt{[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]}$, where
$s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}=\frac{9.0+7.5+6.5}{2}=11.5 \mathrm{~cm}$
Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { area } & =\sqrt{[11.5(11.5-9.0)(11.5-7.5)(11.5-6.5)]} \\
& =\sqrt{[11.5(2.5)(4.0)(5.0)]}=\mathbf{2 3 . 9 8} \mathrm{cm}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Alternatively, area $=\frac{1}{2} a c \sin B$
$$=\frac{1}{2}(9.0)(6.5) \sin 55.07^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 3 . 9 8} \mathbf{c m}^{2}$$

Problem 6. Solve triangle $X Y Z$, shown in Figure 23.8, and find its area given that $Y=128^{\circ}, X Y=7.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $Y Z=4.5 \mathrm{~cm}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-221.jpg?height=232&width=349&top_left_y=1142&top_left_x=1317)

Figure 23.8

Applying the cosine rule,
$$\begin{aligned}
y^{2} & =x^{2}+z^{2}-2 x z \cos Y \\
& =4.5^{2}+7.2^{2}-\left[2(4.5)(7.2) \cos 128^{\circ}\right] \\
& =20.25+51.84-[-39.89] \\
& =20.25+51.84+39.89=112.0 \\
\boldsymbol{y} & =\sqrt{112.0}=\mathbf{1 0 . 5 8} \mathbf{c m}=X \mathbf{Z}
\end{aligned}$$

Applying the sine rule, $\frac{10.58}{\sin 128^{\circ}}=\frac{7.2}{\sin Z}$
from which $\sin Z=\frac{7.2 \sin 128^{\circ}}{10.58}=0.5363$
Hence,
$$Z=\sin ^{-1} 0.5363=\mathbf{3 2 . 4 3}^{\circ}$$
(or $147.57^{\circ}$ which is not possible)
Thus, $\boldsymbol{X}=180^{\circ}-128^{\circ}-32.43^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 9 . 5 7}^{\circ}$
Area of $X Y Z=\frac{1}{2} x z \sin Y=\frac{1}{2}(4.5)(7.2) \sin 128^{\circ}$
$$=12.77 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

\subsection*{23.5 Practical situations involving trigonometry}

There are a number of practical situations in which the use of trigonometry is needed to find unknown sides and angles of triangles. This is demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Problem 7. A room 8.0 m wide has a span roof which slopes at $33^{\circ}$ on one side and $40^{\circ}$ on the other. Find the length of the roof slopes, correct to the nearest centimetre

A section of the roof is shown in Figure 23.9.

Figure 23.9
Angle at ridge, $B=180^{\circ}-33^{\circ}-40^{\circ}=107^{\circ}$
From the sine rule, $\quad \frac{8.0}{\sin 107^{\circ}}=\frac{a}{\sin 33^{\circ}}$ from which $\quad \boldsymbol{a}=\frac{8.0 \sin 33^{\circ}}{\sin 107^{\circ}}=\mathbf{4 . 5 5 6} \mathrm{m}=\boldsymbol{B C}$
Also from the sine rule, $\frac{8.0}{\sin 107^{\circ}}=\frac{c}{\sin 40^{\circ}}$ from which $\quad \boldsymbol{c}=\frac{8.0 \sin 40^{\circ}}{\sin 107^{\circ}}=\mathbf{5 . 3 7 7} \mathbf{m}=\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B}$

Hence, the roof slopes are $\mathbf{4 . 5 6} \mathrm{m}$ and 5.38 m , correct to the nearest centimetre.

Problem 8. A man leaves a point walking at $6.5 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ in a direction $\mathrm{E} 20^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$ (i.e. a bearing of $70^{\circ}$ ). A cyclist leaves the same point at the same time in a direction $\mathrm{E} 40^{\circ} \mathrm{S}$ (i.e. a bearing of $130^{\circ}$ ) travelling at a constant speed. Find the average speed of the cyclist if the walker and cyclist are 80 km apart after 5 hours

After 5 hours the walker has travelled $5 \times 6.5=32.5 \mathrm{~km}$ (shown as $A B$ in Figure 23.10). If $A C$ is the distance the cyclist travels in 5 hours then $B C=80 \mathrm{~km}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-222.jpg?height=375&width=383&top_left_y=962&top_left_x=1273)

Figure 23.10

Applying the sine rule, $\quad \frac{80}{\sin 60^{\circ}}=\frac{32.5}{\sin C}$
from which $\quad \sin C=\frac{32.5 \sin 60^{\circ}}{80}=0.3518$
Hence, $\quad C=\sin ^{-1} 0.3518=20.60^{\circ}$ (or $159.40^{\circ}$, which is not possible)
and
$$B=180^{\circ}-60^{\circ}-20.60^{\circ}=99.40^{\circ}$$

Applying the sine rule again, $\frac{80}{\sin 60^{\circ}}=\frac{b}{\sin 99.40^{\circ}}$
from which $\quad b=\frac{80 \sin 99.40^{\circ}}{\sin 60^{\circ}}=91.14 \mathrm{~km}$
Since the cyclist travels 91.14 km in 5 hours,
average speed $=\frac{\text { distance }}{\text { time }}=\frac{91.14}{5}=\mathbf{1 8 . 2 3} \mathbf{k m} / \mathbf{h}$
Problem 9. Two voltage phasors are shown in Figure 23.11. If $V_{1}=40 \mathrm{~V}$ and $V_{2}=100 \mathrm{~V}$, determine the value of their resultant (i.e. length $O A)$ and the angle the resultant makes with $V_{1}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-223.jpg?height=294&width=452&top_left_y=341&top_left_x=433)

Figure 23.11

Angle $O B A=180^{\circ}-45^{\circ}=135^{\circ}$
Applying the cosine rule,
$$\begin{aligned}
O A^{2} & =V_{1}^{2}+V_{2}^{2}-2 V_{1} V_{2} \cos O B A \\
& =40^{2}+100^{2}-\left\{2(40)(100) \cos 135^{\circ}\right\} \\
& =1600+10000-\{-5657\} \\
& =1600+10000+5657=17257
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, resultant, $\boldsymbol{O A}=\sqrt{17257}=131.4 \mathrm{~V}$
Applying the sine rule $\quad \frac{131.4}{\sin 135^{\circ}}=\frac{100}{\sin A O B}$
from which $\quad \sin A O B=\frac{100 \sin 135^{\circ}}{131.4}=0.5381$
Hence, angle $A O B=\sin ^{-1} 0.5381=32.55^{\circ}$ (or $147.45^{\circ}$, which is not possible)
Hence, the resultant voltage is $\mathbf{1 3 1 . 4}$ volts at $32.55^{\circ}$ to $V_{1}$

Problem 10. In Figure 23.12, $P R$ represents the inclined jib of a crane and is 10.0 m long. $P Q$ is 4.0 m long. Determine the inclination of the jib to the vertical and the length of tie $Q R$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-223.jpg?height=395&width=331&top_left_y=1717&top_left_x=488)

Figure 23.12

Applying the sine rule, $\quad \frac{P R}{\sin 120^{\circ}}=\frac{P Q}{\sin R}$
from which $\quad \sin R=\frac{P Q \sin 120^{\circ}}{P R}=\frac{(4.0) \sin 120^{\circ}}{10.0}$
$$=0.3464$$

Hence, $\angle R=\sin ^{-1} 0.3464=20.27^{\circ}$ (or $159.73^{\circ}$, which is not possible)
$\angle \boldsymbol{P}=180^{\circ}-120^{\circ}-20.27^{\circ}=39.73^{\circ}$, which is the inclination of the jib to the vertical

Applying the sine rule, $\frac{10.0}{\sin 120^{\circ}}=\frac{Q R}{\sin 39.73^{\circ}}$
from which
$$\text { length of tie, } \begin{aligned}
Q R & =\frac{10.0 \sin 39.73^{\circ}}{\sin 120^{\circ}} \\
& =\mathbf{7 . 3 8} \mathbf{~ m}

Problem 12. A crank mechanism of a petrol engine is shown in Figure 23.17. Arm $O A$ is 10.0 cm long and rotates clockwise about $O$. The connecting $\operatorname{rod} A B$ is 30.0 cm long and end $B$ is constrained to move horizontally.
(a) For the position shown in Figure 23.17, determine the angle between the connecting $\operatorname{rod} A B$ and the horizontal, and the length of $O B$.
(b) How far does $B$ move when angle $A O B$ changes from $50^{\circ}$ to $120^{\circ}$ ?

Figure 23.17
(a) Applying the sine rule, $\frac{A B}{\sin 50^{\circ}}=\frac{A O}{\sin B}$
from which $\sin B=\frac{A O \sin 50^{\circ}}{A B}=\frac{10.0 \sin 50^{\circ}}{30.0}$
$$=0.2553$$

Hence, $B=\sin ^{-1} 0.2553=14.79^{\circ}$ (or $165.21^{\circ}$, which is not possible)
Hence, the connecting rod $A B$ makes an angle of $14.79^{\circ}$ with the horizontal.
Angle $O A B=180^{\circ}-50^{\circ}-14.79^{\circ}=115.21^{\circ}$
Applying the sine rule: $\frac{30.0}{\sin 50^{\circ}}=\frac{O B}{\sin 115.21^{\circ}}$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{O B} & =\frac{30.0 \sin 115.21^{\circ}}{\sin 50^{\circ}} \\
& =\mathbf{3 5 . 4 3} \mathbf{~ c m}
\end{aligned}$$

Figure 23.18
In triangle $O A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$, applying the sine rule,
$$\frac{30.0}{\sin 120^{\circ}}=\frac{10.0}{\sin A^{\prime} B^{\prime} O}$$
from which $\sin A^{\prime} B^{\prime} O=\frac{10.0 \sin 120^{\circ}}{30.0}=0.28868$
Hence, $\quad A^{\prime} B^{\prime} O=\sin ^{-1} 0.28868=16.78^{\circ} \quad$ (or $163.22^{\circ}$, which is not possible)
Angle $O A^{\prime} B^{\prime}=180^{\circ}-120^{\circ}-16.78^{\circ}=43.22^{\circ}$
Applying the sine rule, $\frac{30.0}{\sin 120^{\circ}}=\frac{O B^{\prime}}{\sin 43.22^{\circ}}$
from which $O B^{\prime}=\frac{30.0 \sin 43.22^{\circ}}{\sin 120^{\circ}}=23.72 \mathrm{~cm}$
Since $O B=35.43 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $O B^{\prime}=23.72 \mathrm{~cm}$, $B B^{\prime}=35.43-23.72=11.71 \mathrm{~cm}$
Hence, $B$ moves 11.71 cm when angle $A O B$ changes from $50^{\circ}$ to $120^{\circ}$.

\section*{Chapter 24}

\section*{Cartesian and polar co-ordinates}

\subsection*{24.1 Introduction}

There are two ways in which the position of a point in a plane can be represented. These are
(a) Cartesian co-ordinates, i.e. $(x, y)$.
(b) Polar co-ordinates, i.e. $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ is a radius from a fixed point and $\theta$ is an angle from a fixed point.

\subsection*{24.2 Changing from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates}

In Figure 24.1, if lengths $x$ and $y$ are known then the length of $r$ can be obtained from Pythagoras' theorem (see Chapter 21) since $O P Q$ is a right-angled triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-227.jpg?height=313&width=435&top_left_y=1904&top_left_x=436)

Figure 24.1

Hence, $r^{2}=\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$, from which $\quad \boldsymbol{r}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol{x}^{2}+\boldsymbol{y}^{\mathbf{2}}}$
From trigonometric ratios (see Chapter 21), $\tan \theta=\frac{y}{x}$
from which $\theta=\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x}$
$r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ and $\theta=\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x}$ are the two formulae we need to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates. The angle $\theta$, which may be expressed in degrees or radians, must always be measured from the positive $x$-axis; i.e., measured from the line $O Q$ in Figure 24.1. It is suggested that when changing from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates a diagram should always be sketched.

Problem 1. Change the Cartesian co-ordinates $(3,4)$ into polar co-ordinates

A diagram representing the point $(3,4)$ is shown in Figure 24.2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-227.jpg?height=327&width=381&top_left_y=1759&top_left_x=1301)

Figure 24.2

From Pythagoras' theorem, $r=\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=5$ (note that -5 has no meaning in this context).
By trigonometric ratios, $\theta=\tan ^{-1} \frac{4}{3}=53.13^{\circ}$ or 0.927 rad .

Note that $53.13^{\circ}=53.13 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad}=0.927 \mathrm{rad}$.

Hence, (3, 4) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to $\left(5,53.13^{\circ}\right)$ or ( $5,0.927 \mathrm{rad}$ ) in polar co-ordinates.

Problem 2. Express in polar co-ordinates the position (-4, 3)

A diagram representing the point using the Cartesian co-ordinates $(-4,3)$ is shown in Figure 24.3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-228.jpg?height=283&width=430&top_left_y=775&top_left_x=414)

Figure 24.3
From Pythagoras' theorem, $r=\sqrt{4^{2}+3^{2}}=5$
By trigonometric ratios, $\quad \alpha=\tan ^{-1} \frac{3}{4}=36.87^{\circ}$ or 0.644 rad

Hence, $\theta=180^{\circ}-36.87^{\circ}=143.13^{\circ}$
or $\quad \theta=\pi-0.644=2.498 \mathrm{rad}$
Hence, the position of point $\boldsymbol{P}$ in polar co-ordinate form is $\left(5,143.13^{\circ}\right)$ or ( $5,2.498 \mathrm{rad}$ ).

Problem 3. Express $(-5,-12)$ in polar co-ordinates

A sketch showing the position $(-5,-12)$ is shown in Figure 24.4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-228.jpg?height=410&width=375&top_left_y=1872&top_left_x=444)

Figure 24.4
$r=\sqrt{5^{2}+12^{2}}=13$ and $\alpha=\tan ^{-1} \frac{12}{5}=67.38^{\circ}$ or 1.176 rad

Hence, $\theta=180^{\circ}+67.38^{\circ}=247.38^{\circ}$ or $\theta=\pi+1.176=4.318 \mathrm{rad}$.
Thus, $(-5,-12)$ in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to $\left(13,247.38^{\circ}\right)$ or (13, 4.318 rad$)$ in polar co-ordinates.

Problem 4. Express $(2,-5)$ in polar co-ordinates

A sketch showing the position $(2,-5)$ is shown in Figure 24.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-228.jpg?height=405&width=361&top_left_y=795&top_left_x=1284)

Figure 24.5
$r=\sqrt{2^{2}+5^{2}}=\sqrt{29}=5.385$, correct to 3 decimal places $\alpha=\tan ^{-1} \frac{5}{2}=68.20^{\circ}$ or 1.190 rad
Hence, $\theta=360^{\circ}-68.20^{\circ}=291.80^{\circ}$ or $\theta=2 \pi-1.190=5.093 \mathrm{rad}$.

Thus, $(2,-5)$ in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to $\left(5.385,291.80^{\circ}\right)$ or $(5.385,5.093 \mathrm{rad})$ in polar coordinates.

Figure 24.6

From the right-angled triangle $O P Q$ in Figure 24.6, $\cos \theta=\frac{x}{r}$ and $\sin \theta=\frac{y}{r}$ from trigonometric ratios

Hence, $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$.
If lengths $r$ and angle $\theta$ are known then $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$ are the two formulae we need to change from polar to Cartesian co-ordinates.

Problem 5. Change $\left(4,32^{\circ}\right)$ into Cartesian co-ordinates

A sketch showing the position $\left(4,32^{\circ}\right)$ is shown in Figure 24.7.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-229.jpg?height=286&width=440&top_left_y=1598&top_left_x=436)

Figure 24.7
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Now } & x=r \cos \theta=4 \cos 32^{\circ}=3.39 \\
\text { and } & y=r \sin \theta=4 \sin 32^{\circ}=2.12
\end{array}$$

Hence, $\left(4,32^{\circ}\right)$ in polar co-ordinates corresponds to (3.39, 2.12) in Cartesian co-ordinates.

\section*{Problem 6. Express $\left(6,137^{\circ}\right)$ in Cartesian co-ordinates}

A sketch showing the position $\left(6,137^{\circ}\right)$ is shown in Figure 24.8.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-229.jpg?height=291&width=449&top_left_y=305&top_left_x=1267)

Figure 24.8
$$x=r \cos \theta=6 \cos 137^{\circ}=-4.388$$
which corresponds to length $O A$ in Figure 24.8.
$$y=r \sin \theta=6 \sin 137^{\circ}=4.092$$
which corresponds to length $A B$ in Figure 24.8.
Thus, $\left(6,137^{\circ}\right)$ in polar co-ordinates corresponds to (-4.388, 4.092) in Cartesian co-ordinates.
(Note that when changing from polar to Cartesian coordinates it is not quite so essential to draw a sketch. Use of $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$ automatically produces the correct values and signs.)

\section*{Problem 7. Express (4.5, 5.16 rad$)$ in Cartesian co-ordinates}

A sketch showing the position (4.5, 5.16 rad ) is shown in Figure 24.9.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-229.jpg?height=353&width=430&top_left_y=1589&top_left_x=1279)

Figure 24.9
$$x=r \cos \theta=4.5 \cos 5.16=1.948$$
which corresponds to length $O A$ in Figure 24.9.
$$y=r \sin \theta=4.5 \sin 5.16=-4.057$$
which corresponds to length $A B$ in Figure 24.9.
Thus, (1.948, -4.057) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to $(4.5,5.16 \mathrm{rad})$ in polar co-ordinates.

\subsection*{24.4 Use of Pol/Rec functions on calculators}

Another name for Cartesian co-ordinates is rectangular co-ordinates. Many scientific notation calculators have Pol and Rec functions. 'Rec' is an abbreviation of 'rectangular' (i.e. Cartesian) and 'Pol' is an abbreviation of 'polar'. Check the operation manual for your particular calculator to determine how to use these two functions. They make changing from Cartesian to polar coordinates, and vice-versa, so much quicker and easier. For example, with the Casio fx-83ES calculator, or similar, to change the Cartesian number $(3,4)$ into polar form, the following procedure is adopted.
1. Press 'shift'
2. Press 'Pol'
3. Enter 3
4. Enter 'comma' (obtained by 'shift' then ) )
5. Enter 4
6. Press )
7. Press $=$

The answer is $\boldsymbol{r}=\mathbf{5}, \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{5 3 . 1 3}{ }^{\circ}$
Hence, (3, 4) in Cartesian form is the same as $\left(5,53.13^{\circ}\right)$ in polar form.
If the angle is required in radians, then before repeating the above procedure press 'shift', 'mode' and then 4 to change your calculator to radian mode.
Similarly, to change the polar form number ( $7,126^{\circ}$ ) into Cartesian or rectangular form, adopt the following procedure.
1. Press 'shift'
2. Press 'Rec'
3. Enter 7
4. Enter 'comma'
5. Enter 126 (assuming your calculator is in degrees mode)
6. Press )
7. Press $=$

The answer is $\boldsymbol{X}=\mathbf{- 4 . 1 1}$ and, scrolling across, $\boldsymbol{Y}=\mathbf{5 . 6 6}$, correct to 2 decimal places.
Hence, $\left(7,126^{\circ}\right)$ in polar form is the same as $(-4.11,5.66)$ in rectangular or Cartesian form.

Now return to Practice Exercises 94 and 95 in this chapter and use your calculator to determine the answers, and see how much more quickly they may be obtained.

\section*{Areas of common shapes}

\subsection*{25.1 Introduction}

Area is a measure of the size or extent of a plane surface. Area is measured in square units such as $\mathrm{mm}^{2}, \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and $\mathrm{m}^{2}$. This chapter deals with finding the areas of common shapes.

In engineering it is often important to be able to calculate simple areas of various shapes. In everyday life its important to be able to measure area to, say, lay a carpet, order sufficient paint for a decorating job or order sufficient bricks for a new wall.

On completing this chapter you will be able to recognize common shapes and be able to find the areas of rectangles, squares, parallelograms, triangles, trapeziums and circles.

\subsection*{25.2 Common shapes}

\subsection*{25.2.1 Polygons}

A polygon is a closed plane figure bounded by straight lines. A polygon which has

3 sides is called a triangle - see Figure 25.1(a)
4 sides is called a quadrilateral - see Figure 25.1(b)
5 sides is called a pentagon - see Figure 25.1(c)

\subsection*{25.2.2 Quadrilaterals}

There are five types of quadrilateral, these being rectangle, square, parallelogram, rhombus and trapezium.

If the opposite corners of any quadrilateral are joined by a straight line, two triangles are produced. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^{\circ}$, the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is $360^{\circ}$.

\section*{Parallelogram}

In the parallelogram $W X Y Z$ shown in Figure 25.4,
(a) opposite angles are equal,

Figure 25.7
(a) $A B C D$ is a square

The diagonals of a square bisect each of the right angles, hence

\section*{Trapezium}

In the trapezium $E F G H$ shown in Figure 25.6,
$$a=\frac{90^{\circ}}{2}=45^{\circ}$$
(a) only one pair of sides is parallel.
(b) $E F G H$ is a rectangle

In triangle $F G H, 40^{\circ}+90^{\circ}+b=180^{\circ}$, since the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$, from which $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{5 0}{ }^{\circ}$. Also, $\boldsymbol{c}=\mathbf{4 0}^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines $E F$ and $H G$ ). (Alternatively, $b$ and $c$ are complementary; i.e., add up to $90^{\circ}$.)
$d=90^{\circ}+c$ (external angle of a triangle equals the sum of the interior opposite angles), hence $\boldsymbol{d}=90^{\circ}+40^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 3 0}^{\circ}$ (or $\angle E F H=50^{\circ}$ and $d=180^{\circ}-50^{\circ}=130^{\circ}$ ).
(c) JKLM is a rhombus

The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the interior angles and the opposite internal angles are equal. Thus, $\angle J K M=\angle M K L=\angle J M K=\angle L M K=30^{\circ}$, hence, $\boldsymbol{e}=\mathbf{3 0}{ }^{\circ}$.
In triangle $K L M, 30^{\circ}+\angle K L M+30^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ (the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ ), hence, $\angle K L M=120^{\circ}$. The diagonal $J L$ bisects $\angle K L M$, hence, $f=\frac{120^{\circ}}{2}=\mathbf{6 0}^{\circ}$.
(d) $N O P Q$ is a parallelogram
$g=52^{\circ}$ since the opposite interior angles of a parallelogram are equal.
In triangle $N O Q, g+h+65^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$ (the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$ ), from which $h=180^{\circ}-65^{\circ}-52^{\circ}=63^{\circ}$.
$\boldsymbol{i}=\mathbf{6 5}{ }^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines $N Q$ and $O P$ ).
$j=52^{\circ}+i=52^{\circ}+65^{\circ}=117^{\circ}$ (the external angle of a triangle equals the sum of the interior opposite angles). (Alternatively, $\angle P Q O=h=$ $63^{\circ}$; hence, $j=180^{\circ}-63^{\circ}=117^{\circ}$.)
(e) $\boldsymbol{R S T U}$ is a trapezium
$35^{\circ}+k=75^{\circ}$ (external angle of a triangle equals the sum of the interior opposite angles), hence, $k=40^{\circ}$.
$\angle S T R=35^{\circ}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines $R U$ and $S T$ ). $l+35^{\circ}=115^{\circ}$ (external angle of a triangle equals the sum of the interior opposite angles), hence, $\boldsymbol{l}=115^{\circ}-35^{\circ}=\mathbf{8 0}$.

Figure 25.11

Area of a parallelogram $=$ base $\times$ perpendicular height
The perpendicular height $h$ is not shown in Figure 25.11 but may be found using Pythagoras' theorem (see Chapter 21).
From Figure 25.12, $9^{2}=5^{2}+h^{2}$, from which $h^{2}=9^{2}-5^{2}=81-25=56$.
Hence, perpendicular height,
$$h=\sqrt{56}=7.48 \mathrm{~mm}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-236.jpg?height=389&width=706&top_left_y=1731&top_left_x=244)

Figure 25.13

Area of triangle $I J K=\frac{1}{2} \times$ base $\times$ perpendicular height
$$=\frac{1}{2} \times I J \times J K$$

To find $J K$, Pythagoras' theorem is used; i.e.,
$$\begin{aligned}
5.68^{2} & =1.92^{2}+J K^{2}, \text { from which } \\
J K & =\sqrt{5.68^{2}-1.92^{2}}=5.346 \mathrm{~cm}

Problem 7. A rectangular tray is 820 mm long and 400 mm wide. Find its area in (a) $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ (b) $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ (c) $\mathrm{m}^{2}$
(a) Area of tray $=$ length $\times$ width $=820 \times 400$
$$=328000 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$$
(b) Since $1 \mathrm{~cm}=10 \mathrm{~mm}, 1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=1 \mathrm{~cm} \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =10 \mathrm{~mm} \times 10 \mathrm{~mm}=100 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}, \text { or } \\
1 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} & =\frac{1}{100} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=0.01 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}

Hence, $\mathbf{3 2 8 0 0 0} \mathrm{mm}^{\mathbf{2}}=328000 \times 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
$$=3280 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} .$$
(c) Since $1 \mathrm{~m}=100 \mathrm{~cm}, 1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}=1 \mathrm{~m} \times 1 \mathrm{~m}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =100 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{~cm}=10000 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}, \text { or } \\
1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} & =\frac{1}{10000} \mathrm{~m}^{2}=0.0001 \mathrm{~m}^{2}

$$=0.3280 \mathrm{~m}^{2} .$$

Figure 25.17

The shape is that of a rectangle and a triangle.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of rectangle } & =6 \times 8=48 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
\text { Area of triangle } & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height }
\end{aligned}$$
$C D=4 \mathrm{~m}$ and $A D=5 \mathrm{~m}$, hence $A C=3 \mathrm{~m}$ (since it is a $3,4,5$ triangle - or by Pythagoras).

Hence, area of triangle $A B D=\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 3=12 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

Total area of brickwork $=48+12$
$$=60 \mathrm{~m}^{2} .$$

The other two angles in the triangle add up to $120^{\circ}$ and are equal to each other. Hence, each of the triangles is equilateral with each angle $60^{\circ}$ and each side 8 cm .

Figure 25.26
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of one triangle } & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times h
\end{aligned}$$
$h$ is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem:
$$\begin{aligned}
8^{2} & =h^{2}+4^{2} \\
\text { from which } \quad h & =\sqrt{8^{2}-4^{2}}=6.928 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
Area of one triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6.928=27.71 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of hexagon } & =6 \times 27.71 \\
& =\mathbf{1 6 6 . 3} \mathbf{c m}^{\mathbf{2}}

Area of floor plan
$$\begin{aligned}
= & \text { area of triangle } A B C+\text { area of semicircle } \\
& + \text { area of rectangle } C G L M \\
& + \text { area of rectangle } C D E F \\
& - \text { area of trapezium } H I J K
\end{aligned}$$

Triangle $A B C$ is equilateral since $A B=B C=3 \mathrm{~m}$ and, hence, angle $B^{\prime} C B=60^{\circ}$.
$$\sin B^{\prime} C B=B B^{\prime} / 3$$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \qquad \begin{aligned}
B B^{\prime} & =3 \sin 60^{\circ}=2.598 \mathrm{~m} . \\
\text { Area of triangle } A B C & =\frac{1}{2}(A C)\left(B B^{\prime}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(3)(2.598)=3.897 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of semicircle } & =\frac{1}{2} \pi r^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \pi(2.5)^{2} \\
& =9.817 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of } C G L M & =5 \times 7=35 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
\text { Area of } C D E F & =0.8 \times 3=2.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
\text { Area of } H I J K & =\frac{1}{2}(K H+I J)(0.8)
\end{aligned}$$

Since $M C=7 \mathrm{~m}$ then $L G=7 \mathrm{~m}$, hence $J I=7-5.2=1.8 \mathrm{~m}$. Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of HIJK } & =\frac{1}{2}(3+1.8)(0.8)=1.92 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
\text { Total floor area } & =3.897+9.817+35+2.4-1.92 \\
& =49.194 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

To allow for $30 \%$ wastage, amount of carpet required $=1.3 \times 49.194=63.95 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$
Cost of carpet at $Â£ \mathbf{1 6 . 8 0}$ per m ${ }^{2}$
$=63.95 \times 16.80=Â£ \mathbf{1 0 7 4}$, correct to the nearest pound.

Figure 25.29
Area of Figure 25.29(a) $=(x)(x)=x^{2}$

\section*{Chapter 26}

\subsection*{26.1 Introduction}

A circle is a plain figure enclosed by a curved line, every point on which is equidistant from a point within, called the centre.

In Chapter 25, worked problems on the areas of circles and sectors were demonstrated. In this chapter, properties of circles are listed and arc lengths are calculated, together with more practical examples on the areas of sectors of circles. Finally, the equation of a circle is explained.

\subsection*{26.2 Properties of circles}
(a) The distance from the centre to the curve is called the radius, $r$, of the circle (see $O P$ in Figure 26.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-243.jpg?height=297&width=283&top_left_y=1663&top_left_x=515)

Figure 26.1
(b) The boundary of a circle is called the circumference, $c$.
(c) Any straight line passing through the centre and touching the circumference at each end is called the diameter, $\boldsymbol{d}$ (see $Q R$ in Figure 26.1). Thus, $d=2 r$.
(d) The ratio $\frac{\text { circumference }}{\text { diameter }}$ is a constant for any circle. This constant is denoted by the Greek letter $\pi$

\section*{The circle}
(pronounced 'pie'), where $\pi=3.14159$, correct to 5 decimal places (check with your calculator). Hence, $\frac{c}{d}=\pi$ or $\boldsymbol{c}=\boldsymbol{\pi} \boldsymbol{d}$ or $\boldsymbol{c}=\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{\pi} \boldsymbol{r}$.
(e) A semicircle is one half of a whole circle.
(f) A quadrant is one quarter of a whole circle.
(g) A tangent to a circle is a straight line which meets the circle at one point only and does not cut the circle when produced. $A C$ in Figure 26.1 is a tangent to the circle since it touches the curve at point $B$ only. If radius $O B$ is drawn, angle $A B O$ is a right angle.
(h) The sector of a circle is the part of a circle between radii (for example, the portion $O X Y$ of Figure 26.2 is a sector). If a sector is less than a semicircle it is called a minor sector; if greater than a semicircle it is called a major sector.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-243.jpg?height=281&width=264&top_left_y=1698&top_left_x=1359)

Figure 26.2
(i) The chord of a circle is any straight line which divides the circle into two parts and is terminated at each end by the circumference. $S T$, in Figure 26.2, is a chord.
(j) Segment is the name given to the parts into which a circle is divided by a chord. If the segment is less than a semicircle it is called a minor segment (see shaded area in Figure 26.2). If the segment
is greater than a semicircle it is called a major segment (see the un-shaded area in Figure 26.2).
(k) An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle. The distance $S R T$ in Figure 26.2 is called a minor arc and the distance $S X Y T$ is called a major arc.
(1) The angle at the centre of a circle, subtended by an arc, is double the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc. With reference to Figure 26.3,
$$\text { Angle } A O C=2 \times \text { angle } A B C$$

(m) The angle in a semicircle is a right angle (see angle $B Q P$ in Figure 26.3).

Problem 1. Find the circumference of a circle of radius 12.0 cm

Circumference, $c=2 \times \pi \times$ radius $=2 \pi r=2 \pi(12.0)$

Problem 2. If the diameter of a circle is 75 mm , find its circumference

Circumference, $c=\pi \times$ diameter $=\pi d=\pi(75)$
$$=235.6 \mathrm{~mm}$$

Problem 3. Determine the radius of a circular pond if its perimeter is 112 m

Perimeter $=$ circumference, $c=2 \pi r$
Hence, radius of pond, $r=\frac{c}{2 \pi}=\frac{112}{2 \pi}=\mathbf{1 7 . 8 3} \mathbf{~ c m}$

Problem 4. In Figure 26.4, $A B$ is a tangent to the circle at $B$. If the circle radius is 40 mm and $A B=150 \mathrm{~mm}$, calculate the length $A O$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-244.jpg?height=178&width=383&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=1273)

Figure 26.4

A tangent to a circle is at right angles to a radius drawn from the point of contact; i.e., $\boldsymbol{A B O}=\mathbf{9 0}^{\circ}$. Hence, using Pythagoras' theorem,
$$\begin{aligned}
A O^{2} & =A B^{2}+O B^{2} \\
\text { from which, } \quad \boldsymbol{A O} & =\sqrt{A B^{2}+O B^{2}} \\

\subsection*{26.3 Radians and degrees}

One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius. With reference to Figure 26.7, for arc length $s$,
$$\theta \text { radians }=\frac{s}{r}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-245.jpg?height=248&width=256&top_left_y=1492&top_left_x=528)

Figure 26.7
When $s=$ whole circumference $(=2 \pi r)$ then
$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}=\frac{2 \pi r}{r}=2 \pi$$
i.e. $\mathbf{2 \pi}$ radians $=\mathbf{3 6 0}^{\circ}$ or $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ radians $=180^{\circ}$

Thus, $1 \mathbf{r a d}=\frac{\mathbf{1 8 0}^{\circ}}{\boldsymbol{\pi}}=\mathbf{5 7 . 3 0}^{\circ}$, correct to 2 decimal places.
Since $\pi \mathrm{rad}=180^{\circ}$, then $\frac{\pi}{2}=90^{\circ}, \frac{\pi}{3}=60^{\circ}, \frac{\pi}{4}=45^{\circ}$, and so on.

Problem 5. Convert to radians: (a) $125^{\circ}$
(b) $69^{\circ} 47^{\prime}$
(a) Since $180^{\circ}=\pi \mathrm{rad}, 1^{\circ}=\frac{180}{\pi} \mathrm{rad}$, therefore
$$125^{\circ}=125\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}=\mathbf{2 . 1 8 2} \text { radians. }$$
(b) $69^{\circ} 47^{\prime}=69 \frac{47^{\circ}}{60}=69.783^{\circ}$ (or, with your calculator, enter $69^{\circ} 47^{\prime}$ using ${ }^{\circ},, '$ function, press $=$ and press ${ }^{\circ}$, ,' again).
and $69.783^{\circ}=69.783\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}$
$$=1.218 \text { radians }$$

Problem 6. Convert to degrees and minutes:
(a) 0.749 radians (b) $3 \pi / 4$ radians
(a) Since $\pi \mathrm{rad}=180^{\circ}, 1 \mathrm{rad}=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}$
therefore $\quad 0.749 \mathrm{rad}=0.749\left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}=42.915^{\circ}$ $0.915^{\circ}=(0.915 \times 60)^{\prime}=55^{\prime}$, correct to the nearest minute,
Hence, $\mathbf{0 . 7 4 9}$ radians $=\mathbf{4 2}^{\circ} \mathbf{5 5}^{\prime}$
(b) Since $1 \mathrm{rad}=\left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{0}$ then
$$\frac{3 \pi}{4} \mathrm{rad}=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}=\frac{3}{4}(180)^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 3 5}^{\circ}$$

Problem 7. Express in radians, in terms of $\pi$,
(a) $150^{\circ}$
(b) $270^{\circ}$
(c) $37.5^{\circ}$

Since $180^{\circ}=\pi \mathrm{rad}, 1^{\circ}=\frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad}$
(a) $150^{\circ}=150\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}=\frac{5 \pi}{\mathbf{6}} \mathbf{r a d}$
(b) $270^{\circ}=270\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}=\frac{\mathbf{3 \pi}}{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{r a d}$
(c) $37.5^{\circ}=37.5\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}=\frac{75 \pi}{360} \mathrm{rad}=\frac{\mathbf{5 \pi}}{\mathbf{2 4}} \mathbf{r a d}$

from which radius, $r=\frac{c}{2 \pi}=\frac{60.0}{2 \pi}=\frac{30.0}{\pi}$
Area of a circle $=\pi r^{2}$

Problem 11. Find the length of the arc of a circle of radius 5.5 cm when the angle subtended at the centre is 1.20 radians

Length of arc, $s=r \theta$, where $\theta$ is in radians.
Hence, arc length, $s=(5.5)(1.20)=\mathbf{6 . 6 0} \mathbf{c m}$.

Problem 12. Determine the diameter and circumference of a circle if an arc of length 4.75 cm subtends an angle of 0.91 radians

Since arc length, $s=r \theta$ then
radius, $r=\frac{s}{\theta}=\frac{4.75}{0.91}=5.22 \mathrm{~cm}$
Diameter $=2 \times$ radius $=2 \times 5.22=\mathbf{1 0 . 4 4} \mathbf{c m}$
Circumference, $c=\pi d=\pi(10.44)=\mathbf{3 2 . 8 0} \mathbf{~ c m}$

Since $180^{\circ}=\pi \mathrm{rad}$ then $1^{\circ}=\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}$ and $125^{\circ}=125\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \mathrm{rad}$
(a) Length of minor arc,

correct to 3 significant figures
(b) Length of major arc $=$ (circumference - minor $\operatorname{arc})=2 \pi(8.4)-18.3=\mathbf{3 4 . 5} \mathbf{c m}$, correct to 3 significant figures.
(Alternatively, major arc $=r \theta$

Problem 14. Determine the angle, in degrees and minutes, subtended at the centre of a circle of diameter 42 mm by an arc of length 36 mm .
Calculate also the area of the minor sector formed
Since length of arc, $s=r \theta$ then $\theta=\frac{s}{r}$
Radius, $\quad r=\frac{\text { diameter }}{2}=\frac{42}{2}=21 \mathrm{~mm}$, hence $\quad \theta=\frac{s}{r}=\frac{36}{21}=1.7143$ radians.
$1.7143 \mathrm{rad}=1.7143 \times\left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}=98.22^{\circ}=\mathbf{9 8}^{\circ} \mathbf{1 3}{ }^{\prime}=$ angle subtended at centre of circle.
From equation (2),
$$\text { area of sector } \begin{aligned}

Area of sector $=\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta$, hence $2.5=\frac{1}{2}(1.8)^{2} \alpha$ from which, $\quad \alpha=\frac{2.5 \times 2}{1.8^{2}}=1.5432$ radians
$$1.5432 \mathrm{rad}=\left(1.5432 \times \frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{\circ}=88.42^{\circ}$$

Hence, angle $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\mathbf{8 8}^{\circ}$, correct to the nearest degree.

\subsection*{26.5 The equation of a circle}

The simplest equation of a circle, centre at the origin and radius $r$, is given by
$$x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$$

For example, Figure 26.15 shows a circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=9$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-249.jpg?height=394&width=484&top_left_y=2005&top_left_x=414)

Figure 26.15

More generally, the equation of a circle, centre $(a, b)$ and radius $r$, is given by
$$(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}$$

Figure 26.16 shows a circle $(x-2)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=4$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-249.jpg?height=446&width=405&top_left_y=580&top_left_x=1289)

Figure 26.16
The general equation of a circle is
$$x^{2}+y^{2}+2 e x+2 f y+c=0$$

Multiplying out the bracketed terms in equation (1) gives
$$x^{2}-2 a x+a^{2}+y^{2}-2 b y+b^{2}=r^{2}$$

Comparing this with equation (2) gives
and
$$\begin{aligned}
2 e & =-2 a, \text { i.e. } \boldsymbol{a}=-\frac{\mathbf{2 e}}{\mathbf{2}} \\
2 f & =-2 b, \text { i.e. } \boldsymbol{b}=-\frac{\mathbf{2 f}}{\mathbf{2}}
\end{aligned}$$
and $\quad c=a^{2}+b^{2}-r^{2}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol{r}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol{a}^{2}+\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}-\boldsymbol{c}}$
Thus, for example, the equation
$$x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x-6 y+9=0$$
represents a circle with centre,
$$a=-\left(\frac{-4}{2}\right), b=-\left(\frac{-6}{2}\right) \text { i.e., at }(2,3) \text { and }$$
radius, $r=\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}-9}=2$
Hence, $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x-6 y+9=0$ is the circle shown in Figure 26.16 (which may be checked by multiplying out the brackets in the equation $\left.(x-2)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=4\right)$.

Problem 18. Determine (a) the radius and (b) the co-ordinates of the centre of the circle given by the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+8 x-2 y+8=0$
$x^{2}+y^{2}+8 x-2 y+8=0$ is of the form shown in equation (2),
where $\quad a=-\left(\frac{8}{2}\right)=-4, b=-\left(\frac{-2}{2}\right)=1$
and
$$r=\sqrt{(-4)^{2}+1^{2}-8}=\sqrt{9}=3$$

Hence, $x^{2}+y^{2}+8 x-2 y+8=0$ represents a circle centre $(\mathbf{- 4 , 1})$ and radius 3 , as shown in Figure 26.17.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-250.jpg?height=454&width=546&top_left_y=744&top_left_x=356)

Figure 26.17
Alternatively, $x^{2}+y^{2}+8 x-2 y+8=0$ may be rearranged as
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
(x+4)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}-9 & =0 \\
(x+4)^{2}+(y-1)^{2} & =3^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
which represents a circle, centre $(-4,1)$ and radius 3 , as stated above.

Problem 19. Sketch the circle given by the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+6 y-3=0$

The equation of a circle, centre $(a, b)$, radius $r$ is given by
$$(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}$$

The general equation of a circle is $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 e x+2 f y+c=0$
From above $a=-\frac{2 e}{2}, b=-\frac{2 f}{2}$ and $r=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}-c}$
Hence, if $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+6 y-3=0$
then $\quad a=-\left(\frac{-4}{2}\right)=2, b=-\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)=-3 \quad$ and $r=\sqrt{2^{2}+(-3)^{2}-(-3)}=\sqrt{16}=4$

Thus, the circle has centre $(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{- 3})$ and radius 4 , as shown in Figure 26.18.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-250.jpg?height=630&width=544&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=1195)

Figure 26.18

Alternatively, $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+6 y-3=0$ may be rearranged as
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
(x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}-3-13 & =0 \\
(x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2} & =4^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
which represents a circle, centre $(2,-3)$ and radius 4 , as stated above.

\section*{Volumes of common solids}

\subsection*{27.1 Introduction}

The volume of any solid is a measure of the space occupied by the solid. Volume is measured in cubic units such as $\mathrm{mm}^{3}, \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ and $\mathrm{m}^{3}$.

This chapter deals with finding volumes of common solids; in engineering it is often important to be able to calculate volume or capacity to estimate, say, the amount of liquid, such as water, oil or petrol, in different shaped containers.

A prism is a solid with a constant cross-section and with two ends parallel. The shape of the end is used to describe the prism. For example, there are rectangular prisms (called cuboids), triangular prisms and circular prisms (called cylinders).

On completing this chapter you will be able to calculate the volumes and surface areas of rectangular and other prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones and spheres, together with frusta of pyramids and cones. Volumes of similar shapes are also considered.

\subsection*{27.2 Volumes and surface areas of common shapes}

\subsection*{27.2.1 Cuboids or rectangular prisms}

A cuboid is a solid figure bounded by six rectangular faces; all angles are right angles and opposite faces are equal. A typical cuboid is shown in Figure 27.1 with length $l$, breadth $b$ and height $h$.
$$\text { Volume of cuboid }=l \times b \times h$$
and
$$\text { surface area }=2 b h+2 h l+2 l b=2(b h+h l+l b)$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-253.jpg?height=340&width=657&top_left_y=871&top_left_x=1160)

Figure 27.1

A cube is a square prism. If all the sides of a cube are $x$ then
$$\text { Volume }=x^{3} \text { and surface area }=6 x^{2}$$

Problem 1. A cuboid has dimensions of 12 cm by 4 cm by 3 cm . Determine (a) its volume and (b) its total surface area

The cuboid is similar to that in Figure 27.1, with $l=12 \mathrm{~cm}, b=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $h=3 \mathrm{~cm}$.
(a) Volume of cuboid $=l \times b \times h=12 \times 4 \times 3$
$$=144 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$
(b) Surface area $=2(b h+h l+l b)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2(4 \times 3+3 \times 12+12 \times 4) \\
& =2(12+36+48) \\
& =2 \times 96=\mathbf{1 9 2} \mathbf{c m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 2. An oil tank is the shape of a cube, each edge being of length 1.5 m . Determine (a) the maximum capacity of the tank in $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and litres and (b) its total surface area ignoring input and output orifices
(a) Volume of oil tank $=$ volume of cube
$$\begin{aligned}
& =1.5 \mathrm{~m} \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m} \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =1.5^{3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}=\mathbf{3 . 3 7 5} \mathrm{m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$
$1 \mathrm{~m}^{3}=100 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{~cm}=10^{6} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Hence,
$$\text { volume of tank }=3.375 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

1 litre $=1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, hence oil tank capacity
$$=\frac{3.375 \times 10^{6}}{1000} \text { litres }=\mathbf{3 3 7 5} \text { litres }$$
(b) Surface area of one side $=1.5 \mathrm{~m} \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m}$
$$=2.25 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$$

A cube has six identical sides, hence
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { total surface area of oil tank } & =6 \times 2.25 \\
& =13.5 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 3. A water tank is the shape of a rectangular prism having length 2 m , breadth 75 cm and height 500 mm . Determine the capacity of the tank in (a) $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ (b) $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (c) litres

Capacity means volume; when dealing with liquids, the word capacity is usually used.
The water tank is similar in shape to that in Figure 27.1, with $l=2 \mathrm{~m}, b=75 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $h=500 \mathrm{~mm}$.
(a) Capacity of water tank $=l \times b \times h$. To use this formula, all dimensions must be in the same units. Thus, $l=2 \mathrm{~m}, b=0.75 \mathrm{~m}$ and $h=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$ (since $1 \mathrm{~m}=100 \mathrm{~cm}=1000 \mathrm{~mm})$. Hence,
$$\text { capacity of tank }=2 \times 0.75 \times 0.5=\mathbf{0 . 7 5} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}$$
(b) $1 \mathrm{~m}^{3}=1 \mathrm{~m} \times 1 \mathrm{~m} \times 1 \mathrm{~m}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =100 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& \text { i.e., } \mathbf{1 \mathbf { m } ^ { 3 } = \mathbf { 1 0 0 0 } \mathbf { 0 0 0 } = \mathbf { 1 0 } ^ { \mathbf { 6 } } \mathbf { c m } ^ { 3 } \text { . Hence, }} \begin{aligned}
\text { capacity }=0.75 \mathrm{~m}^{3}=0.75 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \\
=\mathbf{7 5 0} \mathbf{0 0 0} \mathbf{c m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$
(c) 1 litre $=1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Hence,
$$750000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=\frac{750,000}{1000}=750 \text { litres }$$

\subsection*{27.2.2 Cylinders}

A cylinder is a circular prism. A cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$ is shown in Figure 27.2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-254.jpg?height=321&width=286&top_left_y=303&top_left_x=1321)

Figure 27.2
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume } & =\pi r^{2} h \\
\text { Curved surface area } & =2 \pi r h \\
\text { Total surface area } & =2 \pi r h+2 \pi r^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Total surface area means the curved surface area plus the area of the two circular ends.

Problem 4. A solid cylinder has a base diameter of 12 cm and a perpendicular height of 20 cm . Calculate (a) the volume and (b) the total surface area
$$\text { (a) } \begin{aligned}
\text { Volume } & =\pi r^{2} h=\pi \times\left(\frac{12}{2}\right)^{2} \times 20 \\
& =720 \pi=\mathbf{2 2 6 2} \mathbf{c m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Total surface area
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2 \pi r h+2 \pi r^{2} \\
& =(2 \times \pi \times 6 \times 20)+\left(2 \times \pi \times 6^{2}\right) \\
& =240 \pi+72 \pi=312 \pi=\mathbf{9 8 0} \mathbf{c m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. A copper pipe has the dimensions shown in Figure 27.3. Calculate the volume of copper in the pipe, in cubic metres.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-254.jpg?height=454&width=733&top_left_y=1926&top_left_x=1106)

Figure 27.3

Outer diameter, $D=25 \mathrm{~cm}=0.25 \mathrm{~m}$ and inner diameter, $d=12 \mathrm{~cm}=0.12 \mathrm{~m}$.

Area of cross-section of copper
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\pi D^{2}}{4}-\frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}=\frac{\pi(0.25)^{2}}{4}-\frac{\pi(0.12)^{2}}{4} \\
& =0.0491-0.0113=0.0378 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, volume of copper
$$\begin{aligned}
& =(\text { cross-sectional area }) \times \text { length of pipe } \\
& =0.0378 \times 2.5=\mathbf{0 . 0 9 4 5} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{27.2.3 More prisms}

A right-angled triangular prism is shown in Figure 27.4 with dimensions $b, h$ and $l$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-255.jpg?height=587&width=435&top_left_y=1152&top_left_x=436)

Figure 27.4
$$\text { Volume }=\frac{1}{2} b h l$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { surface area }= & \text { area of each end } \\
& + \text { area of three sides }
\end{aligned}$$

Notice that the volume is given by the area of the end (i.e. area of triangle $=\frac{1}{2} b h$ ) multiplied by the length $l$. In fact, the volume of any shaped prism is given by the area of an end multiplied by the length.

Problem 6. Determine the volume (in $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) of the shape shown in Figure 27.5
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-255.jpg?height=359&width=321&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=1331)

Figure 27.5

The solid shown in Figure 27.5 is a triangular prism. The volume $V$ of any prism is given by $V=A h$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $h$ is the perpendicular height. Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { volume }=\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 12 \times 40=3840 \mathrm{~mm}^{3} \\
&= \mathbf{3 . 8 4 0} \mathrm{cm}^{3} \\
&\left(\text { since } 1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=1000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. Calculate the volume of the right-angled triangular prism shown in Figure 27.6. Also, determine its total surface area
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-255.jpg?height=717&width=593&top_left_y=1418&top_left_x=1195)

Figure 27.6

Volume of right-angled triangular prism
$$=\frac{1}{2} b h l=\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 \times 40$$
i.e. $\quad$ volume $=960 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Total surface area $=$ area of each end + area of three sides.

In triangle $A B C, \quad A C^{2}=A B^{2}+B C^{2}$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
A C=\sqrt{A B^{2}+B C^{2}} & =\sqrt{6^{2}+8^{2}} \\
& =10 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 9. A square pyramid has a perpendicular height of 16 cm . If a side of the base is 6 cm , determine the volume of a pyramid

\section*{Volume of pyramid}

& =\frac{1}{3} \times(6 \times 6) \times 16 \\
& =\mathbf{1 9 2} \mathbf{c m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 10. Determine the volume and the total surface area of the square pyramid shown in Figure 27.10 if its perpendicular height is 12 cm .

\section*{Volume of pyramid}
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{3}(\text { area of base }) \times \text { perpendicular height } \\

Figure 27.10

The total surface area consists of a square base and 4 equal triangles.

Area of triangle $A D E$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { perpendicular height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times A C
\end{aligned}$$

The length $A C$ may be calculated using Pythagoras ${ }^{\prime}$ theorem on triangle $A B C$, where $A B=12 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $B C=\frac{1}{2} \times 5=2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$.
$$A C=\sqrt{A B^{2}+B C^{2}}=\sqrt{12^{2}+2.5^{2}}=12.26 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Hence,
$$\text { area of triangle } A D E=\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12.26=30.65 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

Total surface area of pyramid $=(5 \times 5)+4(30.65)$
$$=147.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

Problem 11. A rectangular prism of metal having dimensions of 5 cm by 6 cm by 18 cm is melted down and recast into a pyramid having a rectangular base measuring 6 cm by 10 cm . Calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid, assuming no waste of metal

Volume of rectangular prism $=5 \times 6 \times 18=540 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Volume of pyramid
$$=\frac{1}{3} \times \text { area of base } \times \text { perpendicular height }$$

Hence, $\quad 540=\frac{1}{3} \times(6 \times 10) \times h$
from which, $\quad h=\frac{3 \times 540}{6 \times 10}=27 \mathrm{~cm}$
i.e. perpendicular height of pyramid $=27 \mathrm{~cm}$

\subsection*{27.2.5 Cones}

A cone is a circular-based pyramid. A cone of base radius $r$ and perpendicular height $h$ is shown in Figure 27.11.

Volume $=\frac{1}{3} \times$ area of base $\times$ perpendicular height
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-258.jpg?height=513&width=427&top_left_y=850&top_left_x=1251)

Figure 27.11
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume } & =\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h \\
\text { Curved surface area } & =\pi r l \\
\text { Total surface area } & =\pi r l+\pi r^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 12. Calculate the volume, in cubic centimetres, of a cone of radius 30 mm and perpendicular height 80 mm

Volume of cone $=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 30^{2} \times 80$
$$=75398.2236 \ldots \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$$
$1 \mathrm{~cm}=10 \mathrm{~mm}$ and
$1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=10 \mathrm{~mm} \times 10 \mathrm{~mm} \times 10 \mathrm{~mm}=10^{3} \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, or
$$1 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Hence, $75398.2236 \ldots \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$
$=75398.2236 \ldots \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
i.e.,
$$\text { volume }=75.40 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Alternatively, from the question, $r=30 \mathrm{~mm}=3 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $h=80 \mathrm{~mm}=8 \mathrm{~cm}$. Hence,
$$\text { volume }=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 3^{2} \times 8=75.40 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Problem 13. Determine the volume and total surface area of a cone of radius 5 cm and perpendicular height 12 cm

The cone is shown in Figure 27.12.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-259.jpg?height=370&width=264&top_left_y=805&top_left_x=524)

Figure 27.12
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume of cone }=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h & =\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 5^{2} \times 12 \\
& =\mathbf{3 1 4 . 2} \mathbf{c m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Total surface area $=$ curved surface area + area of base
$$=\pi r l+\pi r^{2}$$

From Figure 27.12, slant height $l$ may be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem:
$$l=\sqrt{12^{2}+5^{2}}=13 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Hence, total surface area $=(\pi \times 5 \times 13)+\left(\pi \times 5^{2}\right)$
$$=282.7 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} .$$

\subsection*{27.2.6 Spheres}

For the sphere shown in Figure 27.13:
$$\text { Volume }=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} \quad \text { and } \quad \text { surface area }=4 \pi r^{2}$$

Figure 27.13

Problem 14. Find the volume and surface area of a sphere of diameter 10 cm

Since diameter $=10 \mathrm{~cm}$, radius, $r=5 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Volume of sphere $=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}=\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times 5^{3}$
$$=523.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Surface area of sphere $=4 \pi r^{2}=4 \times \pi \times 5^{2}$
$$=314.2 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

Problem 15. The surface area of a sphere is $201.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Find the diameter of the sphere and hence its volume

Surface area of sphere $=4 \pi r^{2}$.
Hence, $201.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=4 \times \pi \times r^{2}$,
from which $\quad r^{2}=\frac{201.1}{4 \times \pi}=16.0$
and $\quad$ radius, $r=\sqrt{16.0}=4.0 \mathrm{~cm}$
from which, diameter $=2 \times r=2 \times 4.0=8.0 \mathrm{~cm}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume of sphere }=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} & =\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times(4.0)^{3} \\

Here are some worked problems involving more complex and composite solids.

Problem 16. A wooden section is shown in Figure 27.14. Find (a) its volume in $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and (b) its total surface area
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-261.jpg?height=281&width=562&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=375)

Figure 27.14
(a) The section of wood is a prism whose end comprises a rectangle and a semicircle. Since the radius of the semicircle is 8 cm , the diameter is 16 cm . Hence, the rectangle has dimensions 12 cm by 16 cm .
$$\text { Area of end }=(12 \times 16)+\frac{1}{2} \pi 8^{2}=292.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

\section*{Volume of wooden section}
$$\begin{aligned}

Problem 17. A pyramid has a rectangular base 3.60 cm by 5.40 cm . Determine the volume and total surface area of the pyramid if each of its sloping edges is 15.0 cm

The pyramid is shown in Figure 27.15. To calculate the volume of the pyramid, the perpendicular height $E F$ is required. Diagonal $B D$ is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem,
i.e.
$$B D=\sqrt{\left[3.60^{2}+5.40^{2}\right]}=6.490 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Hence, $\quad E B=\frac{1}{2} B D=\frac{6.490}{2}=3.245 \mathrm{~cm}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-261.jpg?height=771&width=430&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=1282)

Figure 27.15
Using Pythagoras' theorem on triangle $B E F$ gives
$$B F^{2}=E B^{2}+E F^{2}$$
from which $\quad E F=\sqrt{\left(B F^{2}-E B^{2}\right)}$
$$=\sqrt{15.0^{2}-3.245^{2}}=14.64 \mathrm{~cm}$$

\section*{Volume of pyramid}
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{3}(\text { area of base })(\text { perpendicular height }) \\
& =\frac{1}{3}(3.60 \times 5.40)(14.64)=\mathbf{9 4 . 8 7} \mathbf{c m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Area of triangle $A D F$ (which equals triangle $B C F$ ) $=\frac{1}{2}(A D)(F G)$, where $G$ is the midpoint of $A D$. Using Pythagoras' theorem on triangle $F G A$ gives
$$F G=\sqrt{\left[15.0^{2}-1.80^{2}\right]}=14.89 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Hence, area of triangle $A D F=\frac{1}{2}(3.60)(14.89)$
$$=26.80 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

Similarly, if $H$ is the mid-point of $A B$,
$$F H=\sqrt{15.0^{2}-2.70^{2}}=14.75 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Hence, area of triangle $A B F$ (which equals triangle $C D F)=\frac{1}{2}(5.40)(14.75)=39.83 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

\section*{Total surface area of pyramid}
$$\begin{aligned}

Problem 19. A rectangular piece of metal having dimensions 4 cm by 3 cm by 12 cm is melted down and recast into a pyramid having a rectangular base measuring 2.5 cm by 5 cm . Calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume of rectangular prism of metal } & =4 \times 3 \times 12 \\
& =144 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Volume of pyramid
$$=\frac{1}{3}(\text { area of base })(\text { perpendicular height })$$

Assuming no waste of metal,
$$144=\frac{1}{3}(2.5 \times 5)(\text { height })$$
i.e. perpendicular height of pyramid $=\frac{144 \times 3}{2.5 \times 5}$
$$=34.56 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Problem 20. A rivet consists of a cylindrical head, of diameter 1 cm and depth 2 mm , and a shaft of diameter 2 mm and length 1.5 cm . Determine the volume of metal in 2000 such rivets

Radius of cylindrical head $=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~cm}=0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and height of cylindrical head $=2 \mathrm{~mm}=0.2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Hence, volume of cylindrical head
$$=\pi r^{2} h=\pi(0.5)^{2}(0.2)=0.1571 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Volume of cylindrical shaft
$$=\pi r^{2} h=\pi\left(\frac{0.2}{2}\right)^{2}(1.5)=0.0471 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Total volume of 1 rivet $=0.1571+0.0471$
$$=0.2042 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

\section*{Volume of metal in 2000 such rivets}
$$=2000 \times 0.2042=408.4 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Problem 21. A solid metal cylinder of radius 6 cm and height 15 cm is melted down and recast into a shape comprising a hemisphere surmounted by a cone. Assuming that $8 \%$ of the metal is wasted in the process, determine the height of the conical portion if its diameter is to be 12 cm

Volume of cylinder $=\pi r^{2} h=\pi \times 6^{2} \times 15$
$$=540 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

If $8 \%$ of metal is lost then $92 \%$ of $540 \pi$ gives the volume of the new shape, shown in Figure 27.16.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-262.jpg?height=462&width=177&top_left_y=1936&top_left_x=1376)

Figure 27.16

Hence, the volume of (hemisphere + cone )
$$=0.92 \times 540 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$
i.e. $\quad \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}\right)+\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=0.92 \times 540 \pi$

Dividing throughout by $\pi$ gives
$$\frac{2}{3} r^{3}+\frac{1}{3} r^{2} h=0.92 \times 540$$

Since the diameter of the new shape is to be 12 cm , radius $r=6 \mathrm{~cm}$,
hence
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2}{3}(6)^{3}+\frac{1}{3}(6)^{2} h & =0.92 \times 540 \\
144+12 h & =496.8
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. height of conical portion,
$$\boldsymbol{h}=\frac{496.8-144}{12}=\mathbf{2 9 . 4} \mathrm{cm}$$

Hence, 50 kg , i.e. 50000 g , has a
$$\text { volume }=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { density }}=\frac{50000}{8.91} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=\mathbf{5 6 1 2} \mathrm{cm}^{3}$$
(b) Volume of wire $=$ area of circular cross-section

(c) Area of circle $=\pi r^{2}$ or $\frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}$ hence, $0.1122=\frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}$ from which, $d=\sqrt{\left(\frac{4 \times 0.1122}{\pi}\right)}=0.3780 \mathrm{~cm}$ i.e. diameter of cross-section is $\mathbf{3 . 7 8 0} \mathbf{~ m m}$.

\subsection*{27.5 Volumes and surface areas of frusta of pyramids and cones}

The frustum of a pyramid or cone is the portion remaining when a part containing the vertex is cut off by a plane parallel to the base.
The volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone is given by the volume of the whole pyramid or cone minus the volume of the small pyramid or cone cut off.
The surface area of the sides of a frustum of a pyramid or cone is given by the surface area of the whole pyramid or cone minus the surface area of the small pyramid or cone cut off. This gives the lateral surface area of the frustum. If the total surface area of the frustum is required then the surface area of the two parallel ends are added to the lateral surface area.
There is an alternative method for finding the volume and surface area of a frustum of a cone. With reference to Figure 27.21,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-265.jpg?height=259&width=285&top_left_y=1183&top_left_x=1349)

Figure 27.21
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Volume } & =\frac{1}{3} \pi h\left(R^{2}+R r+r^{2}\right) \\
\text { Curved surface area } & =\pi l(R+r) \\
\text { Total surface area } & =\pi l(R+r)+\pi r^{2}+\pi R^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 24. Determine the volume of a frustum of a cone if the diameter of the ends are 6.0 cm and 4.0 cm and its perpendicular height is 3.6 cm
(i) Method 1

A section through the vertex of a complete cone is shown in Figure 27.22.
Using similar triangles, $\quad \frac{A P}{D P}=\frac{D R}{B R}$

Hence,
$$\frac{A P}{2.0}=\frac{3.6}{1.0}$$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
A P & =\frac{(2.0)(3.6)}{1.0} \\
& =7.2 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$

Figure 27.22
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { The height of the large cone } & =3.6+7.2 \\
& =10.8 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Volume of frustum of cone}
$$\begin{aligned}
= & \text { volume of large cone } \\
& - \text { volume of small cone cut off } \\
= & \frac{1}{3} \pi(3.0)^{2}(10.8)-\frac{1}{3} \pi(2.0)^{2}(7.2) \\
= & 101.79-30.16=71.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$
(ii) Method 2

From above, volume of the frustum of a cone
where
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{3} \pi h\left(R^{2}+R r+r^{2}\right) \\
R & =3.0 \mathrm{~cm}, \\
r & =2.0 \mathrm{~cm} \text { and } h=3.6 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, volume of frustum
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{3} \pi(3.6)\left[(3.0)^{2}+(3.0)(2.0)+(2.0)^{2}\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{3} \pi(3.6)(19.0)=71.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 25. Find the total surface area of the frustum of the cone in Problem 24.
(i) Method 1

Curved surface area of frustum = curved surface area of large cone - curved surface area of small cone cut off.
From Figure 27.22, using Pythagoras' theorem,
$$A B^{2}=A Q^{2}+B Q^{2}$$
from which $A B=\sqrt{\left[10.8^{2}+3.0^{2}\right]}=11.21 \mathrm{~cm}$ and
$$A D^{2}=A P^{2}+D P^{2}$$
from which $A D=\sqrt{\left[7.2^{2}+2.0^{2}\right]}=7.47 \mathrm{~cm}$
Curved surface area of large cone $=\pi r l$
$$\begin{aligned}
=\pi(B Q)(A B) & =\pi(3.0)(11.21) \\
& =105.65 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
and curved surface area of small cone
$$=\pi(D P)(A D)=\pi(2.0)(7.47)=46.94 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$

Hence, curved surface area of frustum
$$\begin{aligned}
& =105.65-46.94 \\
& =58.71 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Total surface area of frustum}
$$\begin{aligned}
= & \text { curved surface area } \\
& + \text { area of two circular ends } \\
= & 58.71+\pi(2.0)^{2}+\pi(3.0)^{2} \\
= & 58.71+12.57+28.27=\mathbf{9 9 . 6} \mathbf{c m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
(ii) Method 2

From page 252, total surface area of frustum
$$=\pi l(R+r)+\pi r^{2}+\pi R^{2}$$
where $l=B D=11.21-7.47=3.74 \mathrm{~cm}$, $R=3.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $r=2.0 \mathrm{~cm}$. Hence, total surface area of frustum
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\pi(3.74)(3.0+2.0)+\pi(2.0)^{2}+\pi(3.0)^{2} \\
& =99.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}

Problem 26. A storage hopper is in the shape of a frustum of a pyramid. Determine its volume if the ends of the frustum are squares of sides 8.0 m and 4.6 m , respectively, and the perpendicular height between its ends is 3.6 m

The frustum is shown shaded in Figure 27.23(a) as part of a complete pyramid. A section perpendicular to the base through the vertex is shown in Figure 27.23(b).

(b)

Figure 27.23

By similar triangles $\frac{C G}{B G}=\frac{B H}{A H}$
From which, height
$$C G=B G\left(\frac{B H}{A H}\right)=\frac{(2.3)(3.6)}{1.7}=4.87 \mathrm{~m}$$

Height of complete pyramid $=3.6+4.87=8.47 \mathrm{~m}$
Volume of large pyramid $=\frac{1}{3}(8.0)^{2}(8.47)$
$$=180.69 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$$

Volume of small pyramid cut off $=\frac{1}{3}(4.6)^{2}(4.87)$
$$=34.35 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$$

Hence, volume of storage hopper $=180.69-34.35$
$$=146.3 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$$

Problem 27. Determine the lateral surface area of the storage hopper in Problem 26

The lateral surface area of the storage hopper consists of four equal trapeziums. From Figure 27.24,
$$\text { Area of trapezium } P R S U=\frac{1}{2}(P R+S U)(Q T)$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-267.jpg?height=416&width=593&top_left_y=313&top_left_x=1195)

Figure 27.24
$O T=1.7 \mathrm{~m}$ (same as $A H$ in Figure 27.23(b) and $O Q=3.6 \mathrm{~m}$. By Pythagoras' theorem,
$$Q T=\sqrt{\left(O Q^{2}+O T^{2}\right)}=\sqrt{\left[3.6^{2}+1.7^{2}\right]}=3.98 \mathrm{~m}$$

Area of trapezium PRSU
$$=\frac{1}{2}(4.6+8.0)(3.98)=25.07 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$$

Lateral surface area of hopper $=4(25.07)$
$$=100.3 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$$

The curved surface area of a frustum of a cone $=\pi l(R+r)$ from page 252 . Since the diameters of the ends of the frustum are 20.0 cm and 10.0 cm , from Figure 27.25,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-267.jpg?height=513&width=391&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=1293)

Figure 27.25
and
$$\begin{aligned}
r & =5.0 \mathrm{~cm}, R=10.0 \mathrm{~cm} \\
l & =\sqrt{\left[25.0^{2}+5.0^{2}\right]}=25.50 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$
from Pythagoras' theorem.
Hence, curved surface area
$$=\pi(25.50)(10.0+5.0)=1201.7 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$$
i.e., the area of material needed to form the lampshade is $\mathbf{1 2 0 0} \mathbf{~ c m}^{2}$, correct to 3 significant figures.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-268.jpg?height=457&width=481&top_left_y=981&top_left_x=383)

Figure 27.26

Volume of cylindrical portion $=\pi r^{2} h$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\pi\left(\frac{25.0}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& =5890 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Volume of frustum of cone $=\frac{1}{3} \pi h\left(R^{2}+R r+r^{2}\right)$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
& h=30.0-12.0=18.0 \mathrm{~m}, \\
& R=25.0 \div 2=12.5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$r=12.0 \div 2=6.0 \mathrm{~m} .$$

Hence, volume of frustum of cone
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{3} \pi(18.0)\left[(12.5)^{2}+(12.5)(6.0)+(6.0)^{2}\right] \\
& =5038 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Total volume of cooling tower } & =5890+5038 \\
& =10928 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

If $40 \%$ of space is occupied then
volume of air space $=0.6 \times 10928=\mathbf{6 5 5 7} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}$

Volume of Figure 27.27(a) $=(x)(x)(x)=x^{3}$
Volume of Figure 27.27(b) $=(3 x)(3 x)(3 x)=27 x^{3}$
Hence, Figure 27.27(b) has a volume (3) ${ }^{3}$, i.e. 27, times the volume of Figure 27.27(a).
Summarizing, the volumes of similar bodies are proportional to the cubes of corresponding linear dimensions.

Problem 30. A car has a mass of 1000 kg . A model of the car is made to a scale of 1 to 50 . Determine the mass of the model if the car and its model are made of the same material

since the volume of similar bodies are proportional to the cube of corresponding dimensions.
Mass $=$ density $\times$ volume and, since both car and model are made of the same material,
$$\frac{\text { Mass of model }}{\text { Mass of car }}=\left(\frac{1}{50}\right)^{3}$$

\section*{Irregular areas and volumes, and mean values}

\subsection*{28.1 Areas of irregular figures}

Areas of irregular plane surfaces may be approximately determined by using
(a) a planimeter,
(b) the trapezoidal rule,
(c) the mid-ordinate rule, or
(d) Simpson's rule.

Such methods may be used by, for example, engineers estimating areas of indicator diagrams of steam engines, surveyors estimating areas of plots of land or naval architects estimating areas of water planes or transverse sections of ships.
(a) A planimeter is an instrument for directly measuring small areas bounded by an irregular curve. There are many different kinds of planimeters but all operate in a similar way. A pointer on the planimeter is used to trace around the boundary of the shape. This induces a movement in another part of the instrument and a reading of this is used to establish the area of the shape.
(b) Trapezoidal rule

To determine the area $P Q R S$ in Figure 28.1,
(i) Divide base $P S$ into any number of equal intervals, each of width $d$ (the greater the number of intervals, the greater the accuracy).
(ii) Accurately measure ordinates $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$, etc.

Figure 28.1
(iii) Area $P Q R S$
$$=d\left[\frac{y_{1}+y_{7}}{2}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+y_{6}\right] .$$

In general, the trapezoidal rule states
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area }= & \binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\left[\frac{1}{2}\binom{\text { first }+ \text { last }}{\text { ordinate }}\right. \\
& \left.+\left(\begin{array}{c}

To determine the area $A B C D$ of Figure 28.2,
(i) Divide base $A D$ into any number of equal intervals, each of width $d$ (the greater the number of intervals, the greater the accuracy).
(ii) Erect ordinates in the middle of each interval (shown by broken lines in Figure 28.2).
(iii) Accurately measure ordinates $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$, etc.
(iv) Area $A B C D$
$$=d\left(y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+y_{6}\right) .$$

In general, the mid-ordinate rule states

\section*{Area $=($ width of interval $)($ sum of mid-ordinates)}
(d) Simpson's rule

To determine the area PQRS of Figure 28.1,
(i) Divide base $P S$ into an even number of intervals, each of width $d$ (the greater the number of intervals, the greater the accuracy).
(ii) Accurately measure ordinates $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$, etc.

In general, Simpson's rule states
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Area }=\frac{1}{3}\binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\left[\binom{\text { first }+ \text { last }}{\text { ordinate }}\right. \\

Figure 28.11

One cycle of the output voltage is completed in $\pi$ radians or $180^{\circ}$. The base is divided into 6 intervals, each of width $30^{\circ}$. The mid-ordinate of each interval will lie at $15^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 75^{\circ}$, etc.
At $15^{\circ}$ the height of the mid-ordinate is $10 \sin 15^{\circ}=2.588 \mathrm{~V}$,
At $45^{\circ}$ the height of the mid-ordinate is $10 \sin 45^{\circ}=7.071 \mathrm{~V}$, and so on.

The results are tabulated below.

Figure 28.12
(a) The width of each interval is $\frac{12.0}{6} \mathrm{~cm}$. Using Simpson's rule,
$$\begin{aligned}

(b) Mean height of ordinates $=\frac{\text { area of diagram }}{\text { length of base }}$
$$=\frac{34}{12}=2.83 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Since 1 cm represents 100 kPa , mean pressure in the cylinder $=2.83 \mathrm{~cm} \times 100 \mathrm{kPa} / \mathrm{cm}=\mathbf{2 8 3} \mathbf{k P a}$

\section*{Vectors}

\subsection*{29.1 Introduction}

This chapter initially explains the difference between scalar and vector quantities and shows how a vector is drawn and represented.

Any object that is acted upon by an external force will respond to that force by moving in the line of the force. However, if two or more forces act simultaneously, the result is more difficult to predict; the ability to add two or more vectors then becomes important.

This chapter thus shows how vectors are added and subtracted, both by drawing and by calculation, and how finding the resultant of two or more vectors has many uses in engineering. (Resultant means the single vector which would have the same effect as the individual vectors.) Relative velocities and vector $\boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{j}, \boldsymbol{k}$ notation are also briefly explained.

\subsection*{29.2 Scalars and vectors}

The time taken to fill a water tank may be measured as, say, 50 s . Similarly, the temperature in a room may be measured as, say, $16^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or the mass of a bearing may be measured as, say, 3 kg . Quantities such as time, temperature and mass are entirely defined by a numerical value and are called scalars or scalar quantities.

Not all quantities are like this. Some are defined by more than just size; some also have direction. For example, the velocity of a car may be $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ due west, a force of 20 N may act vertically downwards, or an acceleration of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ may act at $50^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Quantities such as velocity, force and acceleration, which have both a magnitude and a direction, are called vectors.

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

\section*{Practice Exercise 113 Scalar and vector quantities (answers on page 352)}
1. State the difference between scalar and vector quantities.

In problems 2 to 9 , state whether the quantities given are scalar or vector.
2. A temperature of $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
3. $5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ volume
4. A downward force of 20 N
5. 500 J of work
6. $30 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ area
7. A south-westerly wind of 10 knots
8. 50 m distance
9. An acceleration of $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ at $60^{\circ}$ to the horizontal

\subsection*{29.3 Drawing a vector}

A vector quantity can be represented graphically by a line, drawn so that
(a) the length of the line denotes the magnitude of the quantity, and
(b) the direction of the line denotes the direction in which the vector quantity acts.

An arrow is used to denote the sense, or direction, of the vector.
The arrow end of a vector is called the 'nose' and the other end the 'tail'. For example, a force of 9 N acting
at $45^{\circ}$ to the horizontal is shown in Figure 29.1. Note that an angle of $\mathbf{+ 4 5 ^ { \circ }}$ is drawn from the horizontal and moves anticlockwise.

Figure 29.1

A velocity of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $-60^{\circ}$ is shown in Figure 29.2. Note that an angle of $\mathbf{- 6 0 ^ { \circ }}$ is drawn from the horizontal and moves clockwise.

Figure 29.2

\subsection*{29.3.1 Representing a vector}

There are a number of ways of representing vector quantities. These include
(a) Using bold print.
(b) $\overrightarrow{A B}$ where an arrow above two capital letters denotes the sense of direction, where $A$ is the starting point and $B$ the end point of the vector.
(c) $\overline{A B}$ or $\bar{a}$; i.e., a line over the top of letter.
(d) $\underline{a}$; i.e., underlined letter.

The force of 9 N at $45^{\circ}$ shown in Figure 29.1 may be represented as
$$\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a} \text { or } \overline{0} \vec{a} \text { or } \overline{0 a}$$

The magnitude of the force is $0 a$.
Similarly, the velocity of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $-60^{\circ}$ shown in Figure 29.2 may be represented as
$$\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{b} \text { or } \overline{0} \vec{b} \text { or } \overline{0 b}$$

The magnitude of the velocity is $0 b$.

In this chapter a vector quantity is denoted by bold print.

\subsection*{29.4 Addition of vectors by drawing}

Adding two or more vectors by drawing assumes that a ruler, pencil and protractor are available. Results obtained by drawing are naturally not as accurate as those obtained by calculation.
(a) Nose-to-tail method

Two force vectors, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$, are shown in Figure 29.3. When an object is subjected to more than one force, the resultant of the forces is found by the addition of vectors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-280.jpg?height=210&width=299&top_left_y=969&top_left_x=1315)

Figure 29.3
To add forces $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$,
(i) Force $F_{1}$ is drawn to scale horizontally, shown as $\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a}$ in Figure 29.4.
(ii) From the nose of $F_{1}$, force $F_{2}$ is drawn at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal, shown as $\boldsymbol{a b}$.
(iii) The resultant force is given by length $\mathbf{0 b}$, which may be measured.
This procedure is called the 'nose-to-tail' or 'triangle' method.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-280.jpg?height=210&width=576&top_left_y=1685&top_left_x=1176)

Figure 29.4
(b) Parallelogram method

To add the two force vectors, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ of Figure 29.3,
(i) A line $c b$ is constructed which is parallel to and equal in length to $\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a}$ (see Figure 29.5).
(ii) A line $a b$ is constructed which is parallel to and equal in length to $\mathbf{0 c}$.
(iii) The resultant force is given by the diagonal of the parallelogram; i.e., length $\mathbf{0 b}$.
This procedure is called the 'parallelogram' method.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=197&width=530&top_left_y=311&top_left_x=391)

Figure 29.5

Problem 1. A force of 5 N is inclined at an angle of $45^{\circ}$ to a second force of 8 N , both forces acting at a point. Find the magnitude of the resultant of these two forces and the direction of the resultant with respect to the 8 N force by (a) the nose-to-tail method and (b) the parallelogram method

The two forces are shown in Figure 29.6. (Although the 8 N force is shown horizontal, it could have been drawn in any direction.)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=199&width=367&top_left_y=1142&top_left_x=473)

Figure 29.6
(a) Nose-to-tail method
(i) The 8 N force is drawn horizontally 8 units long, shown as $\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a}$ in Figure 29.7.
(ii) From the nose of the 8 N force, the 5 N force is drawn 5 units long at an angle of $45^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, shown as $\boldsymbol{a b}$.
(iii) The resultant force is given by length $0 b$ and is measured as $\mathbf{1 2} \mathbf{N}$ and angle $\theta$ is measured as $17^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=193&width=541&top_left_y=1894&top_left_x=386)

Figure 29.7
(b) Parallelogram method
(i) In Figure 29.8, a line is constructed which is parallel to and equal in length to the 8 N force.
(ii) A line is constructed which is parallel to and equal in length to the 5 N force.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=226&width=633&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=1175)

Figure 29.8
(iii) The resultant force is given by the diagonal of the parallelogram, i.e. length $0 b$, and is measured as $\mathbf{1 2} \mathbf{N}$ and angle $\theta$ is measured as $17^{\circ}$.

Thus, the resultant of the two force vectors in Figure 29.6 is $\mathbf{1 2} \mathbf{N}$ at $17^{\circ}$ to the 8 N force.

Problem 2. Forces of 15 and 10 N are at an angle of $90^{\circ}$ to each other as shown in Figure 29.9. Find, by drawing, the magnitude of the resultant of these two forces and the direction of the resultant with respect to the 15 N force
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=324&width=351&top_left_y=1221&top_left_x=1316)

Figure 29.9

Using the nose-to-tail method,
(i) The 15 N force is drawn horizontally 15 units long, as shown in Figure 29.10.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-281.jpg?height=345&width=375&top_left_y=1861&top_left_x=1304)

Figure 29.10
(ii) From the nose of the 15 N force, the 10 N force is drawn 10 units long at an angle of $90^{\circ}$ to the horizontal as shown.
(iii) The resultant force is shown as $R$ and is measured as $\mathbf{1 8} \mathbf{N}$ and angle $\theta$ is measured as $\mathbf{3 4}$.

Thus, the resultant of the two force vectors is 18 N at $34^{\circ}$ to the $\mathbf{1 5 N}$ force.

Problem 3. Velocities of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, 20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ act as shown in Figure 29.11. Determine, by drawing, the magnitude of the resultant velocity and its direction relative to the horizontal
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-282.jpg?height=491&width=603&top_left_y=747&top_left_x=328)

Figure 29.11
When more than 2 vectors are being added the nose-totail method is used. The order in which the vectors are added does not matter. In this case the order taken is $\nu_{1}$, then $\nu_{2}$, then $\nu_{3}$. However, if a different order is taken the same result will occur.
(i) $v_{1}$ is drawn 10 units long at an angle of $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, shown as $\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a}$ in Figure 29.12.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-282.jpg?height=535&width=416&top_left_y=1707&top_left_x=421)

Figure 29.12
(ii) From the nose of $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}$ is drawn 20 units long at an angle of $90^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, shown as $\boldsymbol{a b}$.
(iii) From the nose of $\nu_{2}, \nu_{3}$ is drawn 15 units long at an angle of $195^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, shown as $\boldsymbol{b r}$.
(iv) The resultant velocity is given by length $\mathbf{0 r}$ and is measured as $\mathbf{2 2} \mathbf{~ m} / \mathbf{s}$ and the angle measured to the horizontal is $\mathbf{1 0 5}^{\circ}$.

Thus, the resultant of the three velocities is $22 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $105^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Worked Examples 1 to 3 have demonstrated how vectors are added to determine their resultant and their direction. However, drawing to scale is time-consuming and not highly accurate. The following sections demonstrate how to determine resultant vectors by calculation using horizontal and vertical components and, where possible, by Pythagoras' theorem.

\subsection*{29.5 Resolving vectors into horizontal and vertical components}

A force vector $\boldsymbol{F}$ is shown in Figure 29.13 at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal. Such a vector can be resolved into two components such that the vector addition of the components is equal to the original vector.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-282.jpg?height=218&width=365&top_left_y=1361&top_left_x=1282)

Figure 29.13
The two components usually taken are a horizontal component and a vertical component. If a right-angled triangle is constructed as shown in Figure 29.14, 0a is called the horizontal component of $F$ and $a b$ is called the vertical component of $F$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-282.jpg?height=277&width=383&top_left_y=1909&top_left_x=1273)

Figure 29.14
From trigonometry (see Chapter 21 and remember SOH CAH TOA),
$$\cos \theta=\frac{0 a}{0 b}, \text { from which } 0 a=0 b \cos \theta=F \cos \theta$$
i.e. the horizontal component of $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F} \cos \boldsymbol{\theta}$, and
$$\sin \theta=\frac{a b}{0 b} \text { from which, } a b=0 b \sin \theta=F \sin \theta$$
i.e. the vertical component of $F=F \sin \theta$.

Problem 4. Resolve the force vector of 50 N at an angle of $35^{\circ}$ to the horizontal into its horizontal and vertical components

The horizontal component of the 50 N force, $0 a=50 \cos 35^{\circ}=40.96 \mathrm{~N}$.
The vertical component of the 50 N force, $a b=50 \sin 35^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 8 . 6 8} \mathbf{N}$.
The horizontal and vertical components are shown in Figure 29.15.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-283.jpg?height=272&width=443&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=435)

Figure 29.15
(To check: by Pythagoras,
and
$$\begin{aligned}
0 b & =\sqrt{40.96^{2}+28.68^{2}}=50 \mathrm{~N} \\
\theta & =\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{28.68}{40.96}\right)=35^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the vector addition of components 40.96 N and 28.68 N is 50 N at $35^{\circ}$.)

Problem 5. Resolve the velocity vector of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at an angle of $-30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal into horizontal and vertical components

The horizontal component of the $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity, $0 a=20 \cos \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=\mathbf{1 7 . 3 2} \mathbf{m} / \mathbf{s}$.
The vertical component of the $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity, $a b=20 \sin \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=-\mathbf{1 0 m} / \mathbf{s}$.
The horizontal and vertical components are shown in Figure 29.16.

Problem 6. Resolve the displacement vector of 40 m at an angle of $120^{\circ}$ into horizontal and vertical components
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-283.jpg?height=291&width=433&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=1275)

Figure 29.16

The horizontal component of the 40 m displacement, $0 a=40 \cos 120^{\circ}=\mathbf{- 2 0 . 0} \mathbf{m}$.
The vertical component of the 40 m displacement, $a b=40 \sin 120^{\circ}=\mathbf{3 4 . 6 4} \mathbf{m}$.
The horizontal and vertical components are shown in Figure 29.17.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-283.jpg?height=264&width=383&top_left_y=1007&top_left_x=1300)

Figure 29.17

\subsection*{29.6 Addition of vectors by calculation}

Two force vectors, $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$, are shown in Figure 29.18, $F_{1}$ being at an angle of $\theta_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ at an angle of $\theta_{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-283.jpg?height=486&width=544&top_left_y=1715&top_left_x=1222)

Figure 29.18
A method of adding two vectors together is to use horizontal and vertical components.
The horizontal component of force $F_{1}$ is $F_{1} \cos \theta_{1}$ and the horizontal component of force $F_{2}$ is $F_{2} \cos \theta_{2}$. The
total horizontal component of the two forces,
$$H=F_{1} \cos \theta_{1}+F_{2} \cos \theta_{2}$$

The vertical component of force $F_{1}$ is $F_{1} \sin \theta_{1}$ and the vertical component of force $F_{2}$ is $F_{2} \sin \theta_{2}$. The total vertical component of the two forces,
$$V=F_{1} \sin \theta_{1}+F_{2} \sin \theta_{2}$$

Since we have $H$ and $V$, the resultant of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ is obtained by using the theorem of Pythagoras. From Figure 29.19,
$$0 b^{2}=H^{2}+V^{2}$$
i.e. $\quad$ resultant $=\sqrt{\boldsymbol{H}^{2}+V^{2}}$ at an angle
$$\text { given by } \theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{H}\right)$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-284.jpg?height=237&width=326&top_left_y=1145&top_left_x=466)

Figure 29.19

Problem 7. A force of 5 N is inclined at an angle of $45^{\circ}$ to a second force of 8 N , both forces acting at a point. Calculate the magnitude of the resultant of these two forces and the direction of the resultant with respect to the 8 N force

The two forces are shown in Figure 29.20.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-284.jpg?height=235&width=416&top_left_y=1881&top_left_x=421)

Figure 29.20

The horizontal component of the 8 N force is $8 \cos 0^{\circ}$ and the horizontal component of the 5 N force is $5 \cos 45^{\circ}$. The total horizontal component of the two forces,
$$\boldsymbol{H}=8 \cos 0^{\circ}+5 \cos 45^{\circ}=8+3.5355=\mathbf{1 1 . 5 3 5 5}$$

The vertical component of the 8 N force is $8 \sin 0^{\circ}$ and the vertical component of the 5 N force is $5 \sin 45^{\circ}$. The total vertical component of the two forces,
$$\boldsymbol{V}=8 \sin 0^{\circ}+5 \sin 45^{\circ}=0+3.5355=\mathbf{3 . 5 3 5 5}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-284.jpg?height=259&width=487&top_left_y=581&top_left_x=1221)

Figure 29.21

From Figure 29.21, magnitude of resultant vector
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\sqrt{H^{2}+V^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{11.5355^{2}+3.5355^{2}}=\mathbf{1 2 . 0 7} \mathbf{N}
\end{aligned}$$

The direction of the resultant vector,
$$\begin{aligned}
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{H}\right) & =\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{3.5355}{11.5355}\right) \\
& =\tan ^{-1} 0.30648866 \ldots=\mathbf{1 7 . 0 4}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the resultant of the two forces is a single vector of 12.07 N at $17.04^{\circ}$ to the 8 N vector.

Problem 8. Forces of 15 N and 10 N are at an angle of $90^{\circ}$ to each other as shown in Figure 29.22. Calculate the magnitude of the resultant of these two forces and its direction with respect to the 15 N force
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-284.jpg?height=318&width=354&top_left_y=1815&top_left_x=1290)

Figure 29.22

The horizontal component of the 15 N force is $15 \cos 0^{\circ}$ and the horizontal component of the 10 N force is $10 \cos 90^{\circ}$. The total horizontal component of the two velocities,
$$\boldsymbol{H}=15 \cos 0^{\circ}+10 \cos 90^{\circ}=15+0=\mathbf{1 5}$$

The vertical component of the 15 N force is $15 \sin 0^{\circ}$ and the vertical component of the 10 N force is $10 \sin 90^{\circ}$. The total vertical component of the two velocities,
$$\boldsymbol{V}=15 \sin 0^{\circ}+10 \sin 90^{\circ}=0+10=\mathbf{1 0}$$

Magnitude of resultant vector
$=\sqrt{H^{2}+V^{2}}=\sqrt{15^{2}+10^{2}}=\mathbf{1 8 . 0 3} \mathbf{N}$
The direction of the resultant vector,
$\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{H}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{10}{15}\right)=33.69^{\circ}$
Thus, the resultant of the two forces is a single vector of 18.03 N at $33.69^{\circ}$ to the 15 N vector.

There is an alternative method of calculating the resultant vector in this case. If we used the triangle method, the diagram would be as shown in Figure 29.23.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-285.jpg?height=340&width=375&top_left_y=1018&top_left_x=466)

Figure 29.23
Since a right-angled triangle results, we could use Pythagoras' theorem without needing to go through the procedure for horizontal and vertical components. In fact, the horizontal and vertical components are 15 N and 10 N respectively.
This is, of course, a special case. Pythagoras can only be used when there is an angle of $90^{\circ}$ between vectors. This is demonstrated in worked Problem 9.

Problem 9. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the two acceleration vectors shown in Figure 29.24.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-285.jpg?height=378&width=313&top_left_y=2018&top_left_x=500)

Figure 29.24

The $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ acceleration is drawn horizontally, shown as $\mathbf{0} \boldsymbol{a}$ in Figure 29.25.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-285.jpg?height=411&width=405&top_left_y=418&top_left_x=1289)

Figure 29.25
From the nose of the $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ acceleration, the $28 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ acceleration is drawn at an angle of $90^{\circ}$ to the horizontal, shown as $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$.
The resultant acceleration, $R$, is given by length $\mathbf{0 b}$.
Since a right-angled triangle results, the theorem of Pythagoras may be used.
and
$$\begin{aligned}
0 b & =\sqrt{15^{2}+28^{2}}=\mathbf{3 1 . 7 6 m} / \mathbf{s}^{2} \\
\alpha & =\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{28}{15}\right)=\mathbf{6 1 . 8 2}
\end{aligned}$$

Measuring from the horizontal,
$\boldsymbol{\theta}=180^{\circ}-61.82^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 1 8 . 1 8}^{\circ}$

The horizontal component of the $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity $=10 \cos 30^{\circ}=8.660 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$,
the horizontal component of the $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity is $20 \cos 90^{\circ}=0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
and the horizontal component of the $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity is $15 \cos 195^{\circ}=-14.489 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
The total horizontal component of the three velocities,
$$\boldsymbol{H}=8.660+0-14.489=-\mathbf{5 . 8 2 9} \mathbf{m} / \mathbf{s}$$

The vertical component of the $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ velocity $=10 \sin 30^{\circ}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$,

Figure 29.27
From Figure 29.27, magnitude of resultant vector,
$R=\sqrt{H^{2}+V^{2}}=\sqrt{5.829^{2}+21.118^{2}}=\mathbf{2 1 . 9 1 \mathbf { m } / \mathbf { s }}$
The direction of the resultant vector,
$$\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{H}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{21.118}{5.829}\right)=74.57^{\circ}$$

Measuring from the horizontal,
$\boldsymbol{\theta}=180^{\circ}-74.57^{\circ}=105.43^{\circ}$.
Thus, the resultant of the three velocities is a single vector of $21.91 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $105.43^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Find $\boldsymbol{a}_{1}+\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{2}}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}_{1}-\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{2}}$ by (a) drawing a scale vector diagram and (b) calculation

Vertical component of $\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{1}}+\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{2}}$, $\boldsymbol{V}=1.5 \sin 90^{\circ}+2.6 \sin 145^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 . 9 9}$
From Figure 29.36, the magnitude of $a_{1}+a_{2}$, $\boldsymbol{R}=\sqrt{(-2.13)^{2}+2.99^{2}}=\mathbf{3 . 6 7 m} / \mathbf{s}^{\mathbf{2}}$
In Figure 29.36, $\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2.99}{2.13}\right)=54.53^{\circ}$ and $\theta=180^{\circ}-54.53^{\circ}=125.47^{\circ}$

$=1.5 \sin 90^{\circ}-2.6 \sin 145^{\circ}=0$
Magnitude of $\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{1}}-\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{2}}=\sqrt{2.13^{2}+0^{2}}$
$=2.13 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$
Direction of $\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{1}}-\boldsymbol{a}_{\mathbf{2}}=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{0}{2.13}\right)=\mathbf{0}^{\circ}$

(a) The vectors are shown in Figure 29.37.

The vertical component of $\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathbf{1}} \boldsymbol{- \boldsymbol { v } _ { \mathbf { 2 } } + \boldsymbol { v } _ { \mathbf { 3 } }}$ $=\left(22 \sin 140^{\circ}\right)-\left(40 \sin 190^{\circ}\right)+\left(15 \sin 290^{\circ}\right)$ $=(14.14)-(-6.95)+(-14.10)=\mathbf{6 . 9 9}$ units
The magnitude of the resultant,
$\boldsymbol{R}=\sqrt{27.67^{2}+6.99^{2}}=\mathbf{2 8 . 5 4}$ units
The direction of the resultant
$R=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{6.99}{27.67}\right)=14.18^{\circ}$
Thus, $v_{1}-v_{2}+v_{3}=28.54$ units at $\mathbf{1 4 . 1 8}^{\circ}$
(b) The horizontal component of $v_{2}-v_{1}-v_{3}$
$=\left(40 \cos 190^{\circ}\right)-\left(22 \cos 140^{\circ}\right)-\left(15 \cos 290^{\circ}\right)$
$=(-39.39)-(-16.85)-(5.13)=-27.67$ units

$=(-6.95)-(14.14)-(-14.10)=\mathbf{- 6 . 9 9}$ units
From Figure 29.38, the magnitude of the resultant, $\boldsymbol{R}=\sqrt{(-27.67)^{2}+(-6.99)^{2}}=\mathbf{2 8 . 5 4}$ units and $\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{6.99}{27.67}\right)=14.18^{\circ}$, from which, $\theta=180^{\circ}+14.18^{\circ}=194.18^{\circ}$

Figure 29.38

Thus, $\boldsymbol{v}_{2}-v_{1}-v_{3}=\mathbf{2 8 . 5 4}$ units at $\mathbf{1 9 4 . 1 8}{ }^{\circ}$
This result is as expected, since $\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathbf{2}}-\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathbf{1}}-\boldsymbol{v}_{\mathbf{3}}$ $=-\left(v_{1}-v_{2}+v_{3}\right)$ and the vector 28.54 units at $194.18^{\circ}$ is minus times (i.e. is $180^{\circ}$ out of phase with) the vector 28.54 units at $14.18^{\circ}$

\subsection*{29.8 Relative velocity}

For relative velocity problems, some fixed datum point needs to be selected. This is often a fixed point on the earth's surface. In any vector equation, only the start and finish points affect the resultant vector of a system. Two different systems are shown in Figure 29.39, but, in each of the systems, the resultant vector is $\boldsymbol{a d}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-289.jpg?height=256&width=635&top_left_y=2155&top_left_x=336)

Figure 29.39

The vector equation of the system shown in Figure 29.39(a) is
$$a d=a b+b d$$
and that for the system shown in Figure 29.39(b) is
$$a d=a b+b c+c d$$

Thus, in vector equations of this form, only the first and last letters, $a$ and $d$, respectively, fix the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector. This principle is used in relative velocity problems.

Problem 13. Two cars, $P$ and $Q$, are travelling towards the junction of two roads which are at right angles to one another. Car $P$ has a velocity of $45 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ due east and car $Q$ a velocity of $55 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ due south. Calculate (a) the velocity of car $P$ relative to car $Q$ and (b) the velocity of car $Q$ relative to car $P$
(a) The directions of the cars are shown in Figure 29.40(a), which is called a space diagram. The velocity diagram is shown in Figure 29.40(b), in which $\boldsymbol{p e}$ is taken as the velocity of car $P$ relative to point $e$ on the earth's surface. The velocity of $P$ relative to $Q$ is vector $\boldsymbol{p q}$ and the vector equation is $\boldsymbol{p q}=\boldsymbol{p e} \boldsymbol{e} \boldsymbol{e q}$. Hence, the vector directions are as shown, $\boldsymbol{e q}$ being in the opposite direction to $q \boldsymbol{e}$.

Figure 29.40
From the geometry of the vector triangle, the magnitude of $p q=\sqrt{45^{2}+55^{2}}=71.06 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ and the direction of $p q=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{55}{45}\right)=50.71^{\circ}$ That is, the velocity of car $P$ relative to car $Q$ is $71.06 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ at $50.71^{\circ}$
(b) The velocity of car $Q$ relative to car $P$ is given by the vector equation $\boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{e}+\boldsymbol{e} \boldsymbol{p}$ and the vector diagram is as shown in Figure 29.40(c), having $\boldsymbol{e p}$ opposite in direction to $\boldsymbol{p e}$.

From the geometry of this vector triangle, the magnitude of $\boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{p}=\sqrt{45^{2}+55^{2}}=71.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and the direction of $\boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{p}=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{55}{45}\right)=50.71^{\circ}$ but must lie in the third quadrant; i.e., the required angle is $180^{\circ}+50.71^{\circ}=230.71^{\circ}$
That is, the velocity of car $\boldsymbol{Q}$ relative to car $P$ is $71.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ at $230.71^{\circ}$

\title{
Methods of adding alternating waveforms
}

\subsection*{30.1 Combining two periodic functions}

There are a number of instances in engineering and science where waveforms have to be combined and where it is required to determine the single phasor (called the resultant) that could replace two or more separate phasors. Uses are found in electrical alternating current theory, in mechanical vibrations, in the addition of forces and with sound waves.

There are a number of methods of determining the resultant waveform. These include
(a) Drawing the waveforms and adding graphically.
(b) Drawing the phasors and measuring the resultant.
(c) Using the cosine and sine rules.
(d) Using horizontal and vertical components.

\subsection*{30.2 Plotting periodic functions}

This may be achieved by sketching the separate functions on the same axes and then adding (or subtracting) ordinates at regular intervals. This is demonstrated in the following worked problems.

> Problem 1. Plot the graph of $y_{1}=3 \sin A$ from $A=0^{\circ}$ to $A=360^{\circ}$. On the same axes plot $y_{2}=2 \cos A$. By adding ordinates, plot $y_{R}=3 \sin A+2 \cos A$ and obtain a sinusoidal expression for this resultant waveform
$y_{1}=3 \sin A$ and $y_{2}=2 \cos A$ are shown plotted in Figure 30.1. Ordinates may be added at, say, $15^{\circ}$ intervals. For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { at } 0^{\circ}, y_{1}+y_{2}=0+2=2 \\
& \text { at } 15^{\circ}, y_{1}+y_{2}=0.78+1.93=2.71 \\
& \text { at } 120^{\circ}, y_{1}+y_{2}=2.60+-1=1.6
\end{aligned}$$
at $210^{\circ}, y_{1}+y_{2}=-1.50-1.73=-3.23$, and so on.

The resultant waveform, shown by the broken line, has the same period, i.e. $360^{\circ}$, and thus the same frequency as the single phasors. The maximum value, or amplitude, of the resultant is 3.6. The resultant
waveform leads $y_{1}=3 \sin A$ by $34^{\circ}$ or $34 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad}=$ 0.593 rad .

The sinusoidal expression for the resultant waveform is
$$y_{R}=3.6 \sin \left(A+34^{\circ}\right) \text { or } y_{R}=3.6 \sin (A+0.593)$$

Problem 2. Plot the graphs of $y_{1}=4 \sin \omega t$ and $y_{2}=3 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 3)$ on the same axes, over one cycle. By adding ordinates at intervals plot $y_{R}=y_{1}+y_{2}$ and obtain a sinusoidal expression for the resultant waveform
$y_{1}=4 \sin \omega t$ and $y_{2}=3 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 3)$ are shown plotted in Figure 30.2.

Figure 30.2

Ordinates are added at $15^{\circ}$ intervals and the resultant is shown by the broken line. The amplitude of the resultant is 6.1 and it lags $y_{1}$ by $25^{\circ}$ or 0.436 rad .
Hence, the sinusoidal expression for the resultant waveform is
$$y_{R}=6.1 \sin (\omega t-0.436)$$

Problem 3. Determine a sinusoidal expression for $y_{1}-y_{2}$ when $y_{1}=4 \sin \omega t$ and
$y_{2}=3 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 3)$
$y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are shown plotted in Figure 30.3. At $15^{\circ}$ intervals $y_{2}$ is subtracted from $y_{1}$. For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { at } 0^{\circ}, y_{1}-y_{2}=0-(-2.6)=+2.6 \\
& \text { at } 30^{\circ}, y_{1}-y_{2}=2-(-1.5)=+3.5 \\
& \text { at } 150^{\circ}, y_{1}-y_{2}=2-3=-1, \text { and so on. }
\end{aligned}$$

The amplitude, or peak, value of the resultant (shown by the broken line) is 3.6 and it leads $y_{1}$ by $45^{\circ}$ or 0.79 rad .

Hence,
$$y_{1}-y_{2}=3.6 \sin (\omega t+0.79)$$

Problem 4. Two alternating currents are given by $i_{1}=20 \sin \omega t$ amperes and $i_{2}=10 \sin \left(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$ amperes. By drawing the waveforms on the same axes and adding, determine the sinusoidal expression for the resultant $i_{1}+i_{2}$
$i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are shown plotted in Figure 30.4. The resultant waveform for $i_{1}+i_{2}$ is shown by the broken line. It has the same period, and hence frequency, as $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$. The amplitude or peak value is 26.5 A . The resultant waveform leads the waveform of $i_{1}=20 \sin \omega t$ by $19^{\circ}$ or 0.33 rad .
Hence, the sinusoidal expression for the resultant $i_{1}+i_{2}$ is given by
$$i_{R}=i_{1}+i_{2}=26.5 \sin (\omega t+0.33) \mathrm{A}$$

\subsection*{30.3 Determining resultant phasors by drawing}

The resultant of two periodic functions may be found from their relative positions when the time is zero. For example, if $y_{1}=4 \sin \omega t$ and $y_{2}=3 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 3)$ then each may be represented as phasors as shown in Figure $30.5, y_{1}$ being 4 units long and drawn horizontally and $y_{2}$ being 3 units long, lagging $y_{1}$ by $\pi / 3$ radians or $60^{\circ}$. To determine the resultant of $y_{1}+y_{2}, y_{1}$ is drawn horizontally as shown in Figure 30.6 and $y_{2}$ is joined to the end of $y_{1}$ at $60^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. The resultant is given by $y_{R}$. This is the same as the diagonal of a parallelogram that is shown completed in Figure 30.7.

Figure 30.5
Resultant $y_{R}$, in Figures 30.6 and 30.7, may be determined by drawing the phasors and their directions to scale and measuring using a ruler and protractor. In this

Figure 30.7
example, $y_{R}$ is measured as 6 units long and angle $\phi$ is measured as $25^{\circ}$.
$$25^{\circ}=25 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \text { radians }=0.44 \mathrm{rad}$$

Hence, summarizing, by drawing, $y_{R}=y_{1}+y_{2}=4 \sin \omega t+3 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 3)$ $=6 \sin (\omega t-0.44)$.
If the resultant phasor, $y_{R}=y_{1}-y_{2}$ is required then $y_{2}$ is still 3 units long but is drawn in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 30.8.

Problem 5. Two alternating currents are given by $i_{1}=20 \sin \omega t$ amperes and $i_{2}=10 \sin \left(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$ amperes. Determine $i_{1}+i_{2}$ by drawing phasors

Figure 30.10

The resultant $i_{R}$ is shown and is measured as 26 A and angle $\phi$ as $19^{\circ}$ or 0.33 rad leading $i_{1}$. Hence, by drawing and measuring,
$$i_{R}=i_{1}+i_{2}=26 \sin (\omega t+0.33) \mathrm{A}$$

Problem 6. For the currents in Problem 5, determine $i_{1}-i_{2}$ by drawing phasors

At time $t=0$, current $i_{1}$ is drawn 20 units long horizontally as shown by $0 a$ in Figure 30.11. Current $i_{2}$ is shown, drawn 10 units long in a broken line and leading by $60^{\circ}$. The current $-i_{2}$ is drawn in the opposite direction to the broken line of $i_{2}$, shown as $a b$ in Figure 30.11. The resultant $i_{R}$ is given by $0 b$ lagging by angle $\phi$.

Figure 30.11
By measurement, $i_{R}=17 \mathrm{~A}$ and $\phi=30^{\circ}$ or 0.52 rad . Hence, by drawing phasors,
$$i_{R}=i_{1}-i_{2}=17 \sin (\omega t-0.52) \mathrm{A}$$

\subsection*{30.4 Determining resultant phasors by the sine and cosine rules}

As stated earlier, the resultant of two periodic functions may be found from their relative positions when the time is zero. For example, if $y_{1}=5 \sin \omega t$ and $y_{2}=4 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 6)$ then each may be represented by phasors as shown in Figure 30.12, $y_{1}$ being 5 units long and drawn horizontally and $y_{2}$ being 4 units long, lagging $y_{1}$ by $\pi / 6$ radians or $30^{\circ}$. To determine the resultant of $y_{1}+y_{2}, y_{1}$ is drawn horizontally as shown in Figure 30.13 and $y_{2}$ is joined to the end of $y_{1}$ at $\pi / 6$ radians; i.e., $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. The resultant is given by $y_{R}$.
Using the cosine rule on triangle $0 a b$ of Figure 30.13 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
y_{R}^{2} & =5^{2}+4^{2}-\left[2(5)(4) \cos 150^{\circ}\right] \\
& =25+16-(-34.641)=75.641
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-295.jpg?height=191&width=297&top_left_y=303&top_left_x=508)

Figure 30.12

Figure 30.13
from which
$$y_{R}=\sqrt{75.641}=8.697$$

Using the sine rule, $\frac{8.697}{\sin 150^{\circ}}=\frac{4}{\sin \phi}$
from which
$$\sin \phi=\frac{4 \sin 150^{\circ}}{8.697}=0.22996$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\phi & =\sin ^{-1} 0.22996 \\
& =13.29^{\circ} \text { or } 0.232 \mathrm{rad}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\boldsymbol{y}_{\boldsymbol{R}}=\boldsymbol{y}_{\mathbf{1}}+\boldsymbol{y}_{\mathbf{2}}=5 \sin \omega t+4 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 6)$
$$=8.697 \sin (\omega t-0.232)$$

Problem 7. Given $y_{1}=2 \sin \omega t$ and $y_{2}=3 \sin (\omega t+\pi / 4)$, obtain an expression, by calculation, for the resultant, $y_{R}=y_{1}+y_{2}$

When time $t=0$, the position of phasors $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are as shown in Figure 30.14(a). To obtain the resultant, $y_{1}$ is drawn horizontally, 2 units long, and $y_{2}$ is drawn 3 units long at an angle of $\pi / 4 \mathrm{rad}$ or $45^{\circ}$ and joined to the end of $y_{1}$ as shown in Figure 30.14(b).
From Figure 30.14(b), and using the cosine rule,
$$\begin{aligned}
y_{R}^{2} & =2^{2}+3^{2}-\left[2(2)(3) \cos 135^{\circ}\right] \\
& =4+9-[-8.485]=21.485
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$y_{R}=\sqrt{21.485}=4.6352$$

Using the sine rule
$$\frac{3}{\sin \phi}=\frac{4.6352}{\sin 135^{\circ}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-295.jpg?height=733&width=570&top_left_y=295&top_left_x=1204)

Figure 30.14
from which
$$\sin \phi=\frac{3 \sin 135^{\circ}}{4.6352}=0.45765$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\phi & =\sin ^{-1} 0.45765 \\
& =27.24^{\circ} \text { or } 0.475 \mathrm{rad}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, by calculation, $\quad y_{R}=4.635 \sin (\omega t+0.475)$

Problem 8. Determine
$$20 \sin \omega t+10 \sin \left(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$
using the cosine and sine rules

From the phasor diagram of Figure 30.15 and using the cosine rule,
$$i_{R}^{2}=20^{2}+10^{2}-\left[2(20)(10) \cos 120^{\circ}\right]=700$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-295.jpg?height=218&width=538&top_left_y=1968&top_left_x=1222)

Figure 30.15

Hence,
$$i_{R}=\sqrt{700}=26.46 \mathrm{~A}$$

Using the sine rule gives
$$\frac{10}{\sin \phi}=\frac{26.46}{\sin 120^{\circ}}$$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
\sin \phi & =\frac{10 \sin 120^{\circ}}{26.46} \\
& =0.327296
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\phi & =\sin ^{-1} 0.327296=\mathbf{1 9 . 1 0} \\
& =19.10 \times \frac{\pi}{180}=\mathbf{0 . 3 3 3} \mathbf{r a d}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, by cosine and sine rules, $i_{R}=i_{1}+i_{2}=26.46 \sin (\omega t+0.333) \mathrm{A}$

\subsection*{30.5 Determining resultant phasors by horizontal and vertical components}

If a right-angled triangle is constructed as shown in Figure 30.16, 0a is called the horizontal component of $F$ and $a b$ is called the vertical component of $F$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-296.jpg?height=319&width=462&top_left_y=2075&top_left_x=398)

Figure 30.16

From trigonometry (see Chapter 21 and remember SOH CAH TOA),
$$\cos \theta=\frac{0 a}{0 b}, \text { from which } 0 a=0 b \cos \theta=F \cos \theta$$
i.e. the horizontal component of $\boldsymbol{F}, \boldsymbol{H}=\boldsymbol{F} \cos \boldsymbol{\theta}$, and
$$\sin \theta=\frac{a b}{0 b}, \text { from which } a b=0 b \sin \theta=F \sin \theta$$
i.e. the vertical component of $F, V=F \sin \theta$.

Determining resultant phasors by horizontal and vertical components is demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Problem 9. Two alternating voltages are given by $v_{1}=15 \sin \omega t$ volts and $v_{2}=25 \sin (\omega t-\pi / 6)$ volts. Determine a sinusoidal expression for the resultant $v_{R}=v_{1}+v_{2}$ by finding horizontal and vertical components

The relative positions of $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ at time $t=0$ are shown in Figure 30.17(a) and the phasor diagram is shown in Figure 30.17(b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-296.jpg?height=625&width=565&top_left_y=1534&top_left_x=1185)

Figure 30.17

The horizontal component of $v_{R}$, $\boldsymbol{H}=15 \cos 0^{\circ}+25 \cos \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=\mathbf{3 6 . 6 5 V}$

The vertical component of $v_{R}$, $\boldsymbol{V}=15 \sin 0^{\circ}+25 \sin \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=-\mathbf{1 2 . 5 0} \mathbf{V}$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{R} & =\sqrt{36.65^{2}+(-12.50)^{2}} \\
& \text { by Pythagoras' theorem } \\
& =\mathbf{3 8 . 7 2} \text { volts }
\end{aligned}$$
$$\tan \phi=\frac{V}{H}=\frac{-12.50}{36.65}=-0.3411$$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
\phi & =\tan ^{-1}(-0.3411) \\
& =\mathbf{- 1 8 . 8 3}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $v_{R}=v_{1}+v_{2}=38.72 \sin (\omega t-0.329) \mathrm{V}$

Problem 10. For the voltages in Problem 9, determine the resultant $v_{R}=v_{1}-v_{2}$ using horizontal and vertical components

The horizontal component of $v_{R}$,
$\boldsymbol{H}=15 \cos 0^{\circ}-25 \cos \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=\mathbf{- 6 . 6 5} \mathbf{V}$
The vertical component of $v_{R}$,
$\boldsymbol{V}=15 \sin 0^{\circ}-25 \sin \left(-30^{\circ}\right)=\mathbf{1 2 . 5 0} \mathrm{V}$
Hence,
$$v_{R}=\sqrt{(-6.65)^{2}+(12.50)^{2}}$$
by Pythagoras' theorem
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\mathbf{1 4 . 1 6} \text { volts } \\
\tan \phi & =\frac{V}{H}=\frac{12.50}{-6.65}=-1.8797
\end{aligned}$$
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
\phi & =\tan ^{-1}(-1.8797) \\
& =\mathbf{1 1 8 . 0 1}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$v_{R}=v_{1}-v_{2}=14.16 \sin (\omega t+2.06) \mathrm{V}$$

The phasor diagram is shown in Figure 30.18.

From the phasors shown in Figure 30.19,
Total horizontal component,
$\boldsymbol{H}=20 \cos 0^{\circ}+10 \cos 60^{\circ}=\mathbf{2 5 . 0}$
Total vertical component, $\boldsymbol{V}=20 \sin 0^{\circ}+10 \sin 60^{\circ}=\mathbf{8 . 6 6}$

By Pythagoras, the resultant,
$i_{R}=\sqrt{\left[25.0^{2}+8.66^{2}\right]}=\mathbf{2 6 . 4 6} \mathrm{A}$
Phase angle, $\phi=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{8.66}{25.0}\right)$
$$=19.11^{\circ} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 3 3 3} \mathrm{rad}$$

Hence, by using horizontal and vertical components,
$\underline{20 \sin \omega t+10 \sin \left(\omega t+\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=26.46 \sin (\omega t+0.333)}$

\section*{Presentation of statistical data}

\subsection*{31.1 Some statistical terminology}

\subsection*{31.1.1 Discrete and continuous data}

Data are obtained largely by two methods:
(a) By counting - for example, the number of stamps sold by a post office in equal periods of time.
(b) By measurement - for example, the heights of a group of people.

When data are obtained by counting and only whole numbers are possible, the data are called discrete. Measured data can have any value within certain limits and are called continuous.

Problem 1. Data are obtained on the topics given below. State whether they are discrete or continuous data.
(a) The number of days on which rain falls in a month for each month of the year.
(b) The mileage travelled by each of a number of salesmen.
(c) The time that each of a batch of similar batteries lasts.
(d) The amount of money spent by each of several families on food.
(a) The number of days on which rain falls in a given month must be an integer value and is obtained by counting the number of days. Hence, these data are discrete.
(b) A salesman can travel any number of miles (and parts of a mile) between certain limits and these data are measured. Hence, the data are continuous.
(c) The time that a battery lasts is measured and can have any value between certain limits. Hence, these data are continuous.
(d) The amount of money spent on food can only be expressed correct to the nearest pence, the amount being counted. Hence, these data are discrete.

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

\section*{Practice Exercise 122 Discrete and continuous data (answers on page 353)}

In the following problems, state whether data relating to the topics given are discrete or continuous.
1. (a) The amount of petrol produced daily, for each of 31 days, by a refinery.
(b) The amount of coal produced daily by each of 15 miners.
(c) The number of bottles of milk delivered daily by each of 20 milkmen.
(d) The size of 10 samples of rivets produced by a machine.
2. (a) The number of people visiting an exhibition on each of 5 days.
(b) The time taken by each of 12 athletes to run 100 metres.
(c) The value of stamps sold in a day by each of 20 post offices.
(d) The number of defective items produced in each of 10 one-hour periods by a machine.

\subsection*{31.1.2 Further statistical terminology}

A set is a group of data and an individual value within the set is called a member of the set. Thus, if the masses of five people are measured correct to the nearest 0.1 kilogram and are found to be $53.1 \mathrm{~kg}, 59.4 \mathrm{~kg}$, $62.1 \mathrm{~kg}, 77.8 \mathrm{~kg}$ and 64.4 kg then the set of masses in kilograms for these five people is
$$\{53.1,59.4,62.1,77.8,64.4\}$$
and one of the members of the set is 59.4
A set containing all the members is called a population. Some members selected at random from a population are called a sample. Thus, all car registration numbers form a population but the registration numbers of, say, 20 cars taken at random throughout the country are a sample drawn from that population.

The number of times that the value of a member occurs in a set is called the frequency of that member. Thus, in the set $\{2,3,4,5,4,2,4,7,9\}$, member 4 has a frequency of three, member 2 has a frequency of 2 and the other members have a frequency of one.

The relative frequency with which any member of a set occurs is given by the ratio
$$\frac{\text { frequency of member }}{\text { total frequency of all members }}$$

For the set $\{2,3,5,4,7,5,6,2,8\}$, the relative frequency of member 5 is $\frac{2}{9}$. Often, relative frequency is expressed as a percentage and the percentage relative frequency is
$$(\text { relative frequency } \times 100) \%$$

\subsection*{31.2 Presentation of ungrouped data}

Ungrouped data can be presented diagrammatically in several ways and these include
(a) pictograms, in which pictorial symbols are used to represent quantities (see Problem 2),
(b) horizontal bar charts, having data represented by equally spaced horizontal rectangles (see Problem 3), and
(c) vertical bar charts, in which data are represented by equally spaced vertical rectangles (see Problem 4).

Trends in ungrouped data over equal periods of time can be presented diagrammatically by a percentage component bar chart. In such a chart, equally spaced rectangles of any width, but whose height corresponds to $100 \%$, are constructed. The rectangles are then subdivided into values corresponding to the percentage relative frequencies of the members (see Problem 5).

A pie diagram is used to show diagrammatically the parts making up the whole. In a pie diagram, the area of a circle represents the whole and the areas of the sectors of the circle are made proportional to the parts which make up the whole (see Problem 6).

Problem 2. The number of television sets repaired in a workshop by a technician in six one-month periods is as shown below. Present these data as a pictogram
\begin{tabular}{|lccc|}
\hline Month & January & February & March \\
\hline Number repaired & 11 & 6 & 15 \\
\hline Month & April & May & June \\
\hline Number repaired & 9 & 13 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Each symbol shown in Figure 31.1 represents two television sets repaired. Thus, in January, $5 \frac{1}{2}$ symbols are used to represent the 11 sets repaired; in February, 3 symbols are used to represent the 6 sets repaired, and so on.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Month & Number of TV sets repaired 
$\equiv 2$ sets \\

\hline Distance travelled (miles) & 413 & 264 & 597 & 143
\end{tabular}

Use a horizontal bar chart to represent these data diagrammatically

Equally spaced horizontal rectangles of any width, but whose length is proportional to the distance travelled, are used. Thus, the length of the rectangle for salesman $P$ is proportional to 413 miles, and so on. The horizontal bar chart depicting these data is shown in Figure 31.2.

\hline Number of issues & 34 & 17 & 9 & 5 & 27 & 13 & 6

Present these data on a vertical bar chart

Figure 31.3
In a vertical bar chart, equally spaced vertical rectangles of any width, but whose height is proportional
to the quantity being represented, are used. Thus, the height of the rectangle for period 1 is proportional to 34 units, and so on. The vertical bar chart depicting these data is shown in Figure 31.3.

Problem 5. The numbers of various types of dwellings sold by a company annually over a three-year period are as shown below. Draw percentage component bar charts to present these data
\begin{tabular}{|l|ccc|}
\hline & Year 1 & Year 2 & Year 3 \\
\hline 4-roomed bungalows & 24 & 17 & 7 \\
\hline 5-roomed bungalows & 38 & 71 & 118 \\
\hline 4-roomed houses & 44 & 50 & 53 \\
\hline 5-roomed houses & 64 & 82 & 147 \\
\hline 6-roomed houses & 30 & 30 & 25 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A table of percentage relative frequency values, correct to the nearest $1 \%$, is the first requirement. Since
percentage relative frequency
$$=\frac{\text { frequency of member } \times 100}{\text { total frequency }}$$
then for 4-roomed bungalows in year 1 percentage relative frequency
$$=\frac{24 \times 100}{24+38+44+64+30}=12 \%$$

The percentage relative frequencies of the other types of dwellings for each of the three years are similarly calculated and the results are as shown in the table below.
\begin{tabular}{|lccc|}
\hline & Year 1 & Year 2 & Year 3 \\
\hline 4-roomed bungalows & $12 \%$ & $7 \%$ & $2 \%$ \\
\hline 5-roomed bungalows & $19 \%$ & $28 \%$ & $34 \%$ \\
\hline 4-roomed houses & $22 \%$ & $20 \%$ & $15 \%$ \\
\hline 5-roomed houses & $32 \%$ & $33 \%$ & $42 \%$ \\
\hline 6-roomed houses & $15 \%$ & $12 \%$ & $7 \%$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The percentage component bar chart is produced by constructing three equally spaced rectangles of any width, corresponding to the three years. The heights of the rectangles correspond to $100 \%$ relative frequency and are
subdivided into the values in the table of percentages shown above. A key is used (different types of shading or different colour schemes) to indicate corresponding percentage values in the rows of the table of percentages. The percentage component bar chart is shown in Figure 31.4.

Problem 6. The retail price of a product costing $Â£ 2$ is made up as follows: materials 10 p , labour 20 p , research and development 40 p , overheads 70 p , profit 60 p . Present these data on a pie diagram

A circle of any radius is drawn. The area of the circle represents the whole, which in this case is $Â£ 2$. The circle is subdivided into sectors so that the areas of the sectors are proportional to the parts; i.e., the parts which make up the total retail price. For the area of a sector to be proportional to a part, the angle at the centre of the circle must be proportional to that part. The whole, $Â£ 2$ or 200 p, corresponds to $360^{\circ}$. Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 10 \mathrm{p} \text { corresponds to } 360 \times \frac{10}{200} \text { degrees, i.e. } 18^{\circ} \\
& 20 \mathrm{p} \text { corresponds to } 360 \times \frac{20}{200} \text { degrees, i.e. } 36^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$
and so on, giving the angles at the centre of the circle for the parts of the retail price as $18^{\circ}, 36^{\circ}, 72^{\circ}, 126^{\circ}$ and $108^{\circ}$, respectively.
The pie diagram is shown in Figure 31.5.

Figure 31.5
(b) Using the data presented in Figure 31.4, comment on the housing trends over the three-year period.
(c) Determine the profit made by selling 700 units of the product shown in Figure 31.5
(a) By measuring the length of rectangle $P$, the mileage covered by salesman $P$ is equivalent to 413 miles. Hence salesman $\boldsymbol{P}$ receives a travelling allowance of
$$\frac{Â£ 413 \times 37}{100} \text { i.e. } Â£ 152.81$$

Similarly, for salesman $\boldsymbol{Q}$, the miles travelled are 264 and his allowance is
$$\frac{Â£ 264 \times 37}{100} \text { i.e. Â£97.68 }$$

Salesman $\boldsymbol{R}$ travels 597 miles and he receives
$$\frac{Â£ 597 \times 37}{100} \text { i.e. Â£220.89 }$$

Finally, salesman $S$ receives
$$\frac{Â£ 143 \times 37}{100} \text { i.e. Â£52.91 }$$
(b) An analysis of Figure 31.4 shows that 5 -roomed bungalows and 5-roomed houses are becoming more popular, the greatest change in the three years being a $15 \%$ increase in the sales of 5 -roomed bungalows.
(c) Since $1.8^{\circ}$ corresponds to 1 p and the profit occupies $108^{\circ}$ of the pie diagram, the profit per unit is
$$\frac{108 \times 1}{1.8} \text { i.e. } 60 \text { p }$$

The profit when selling 700 units of the product is
$$Â£ \frac{700 \times 60}{100} \text { i.e. } Â£ 420$$

\subsection*{31.3 Presentation of grouped data}

When the number of members in a set is small, say ten or less, the data can be represented diagrammatically without further analysis, by means of pictograms, bar charts, percentage components bar charts or pie diagrams (as shown in Section 31.2).

For sets having more than ten members, those members having similar values are grouped together in
classes to form a frequency distribution. To assist in accurately counting members in the various classes, a tally diagram is used (see Problems 8 and 12).

A frequency distribution is merely a table showing classes and their corresponding frequencies (see Problems 8 and 12). The new set of values obtained by forming a frequency distribution is called grouped data. The terms used in connection with grouped data are shown in Figure 31.6(a). The size or range of a class is given by the upper class boundary value minus the lower class boundary value and in Figure 31.6(b) is 7.65-7.35; i.e., 0.30 . The class interval for the class shown in Figure 31.6(b) is 7.4 to 7.6 and the class mid-point value is given by
$$\frac{(\text { upper class boundary value })+(\text { lower class boundary value })}{2}$$
and in Figure 31.6(b) is
$$\frac{7.65+7.35}{2} \text { i.e. } 7.5$$
(a)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-306.jpg?height=394&width=465&top_left_y=1246&top_left_x=421)

Figure 31.6

One of the principal ways of presenting grouped data diagrammatically is to use a histogram, in which the areas of vertical, adjacent rectangles are made proportional to frequencies of the classes (see Problem 9). When class intervals are equal, the heights of the rectangles of a histogram are equal to the frequencies of the classes. For histograms having unequal class intervals, the area must be proportional to the frequency. Hence, if the class interval of class $A$ is twice the class interval of class $B$, then for equal frequencies the height of the rectangle representing $A$ is half that of $B$ (see Problem 11).

Another method of presenting grouped data diagrammatically is to use a frequency polygon, which is the graph produced by plotting frequency against class midpoint values and joining the co-ordinates with straight lines (see Problem 12).

A cumulative frequency distribution is a table showing the cumulative frequency for each value of upper class boundary. The cumulative frequency for a particular value of upper class boundary is obtained by adding the frequency of the class to the sum of the previous frequencies. A cumulative frequency distribution is formed in Problem 13.

The curve obtained by joining the co-ordinates of cumulative frequency (vertically) against upper class boundary (horizontally) is called an ogive or a cumulative frequency distribution curve (see Problem 13).

Problem 8. The data given below refer to the gain of each of a batch of 40 transistors, expressed correct to the nearest whole number. Form a frequency distribution for these data having seven classes
\begin{tabular}{|llllllll|}
\hline 81 & 83 & 87 & 74 & 76 & 89 & 82 & 84 \\
\hline 86 & 76 & 77 & 71 & 86 & 85 & 87 & 88 \\
\hline 84 & 81 & 80 & 81 & 73 & 89 & 82 & 79 \\
\hline 81 & 79 & 78 & 80 & 85 & 77 & 84 & 78 \\
\hline 83 & 79 & 80 & 83 & 82 & 79 & 80 & 77 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The range of the data is the value obtained by taking the value of the smallest member from that of the largest member. Inspection of the set of data shows that range $=89-71=18$. The size of each class is given approximately by the range divided by the number of classes. Since 7 classes are required, the size of each class is $18 \div 7$; that is, approximately 3 . To achieve seven equal classes spanning a range of values from 71 to 89 , the class intervals are selected as $70-72,73-75$, and so on.

To assist with accurately determining the number in each class, a tally diagram is produced, as shown in Table 31.1(a). This is obtained by listing the classes in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the 40 members of the set in turn and allocating them to the appropriate classes by putting ' 1 's in the appropriate rows. Every fifth ' 1 ' allocated to a particular row is shown as an oblique line crossing the four previous ' 1 's, to help with final counting.

A frequency distribution for the data is shown in Table 31.1(b) and lists classes and their corresponding frequencies, obtained from the tally diagram. (Class mid-point values are also shown in the table, since they are used for constructing the histogram for these data (see Problem 9).)

Problem 9. Construct a histogram for the data given in Table 31.1(b)

The histogram is shown in Figure 31.7. The width of the rectangles corresponds to the upper class boundary values minus the lower class boundary values and the heights of the rectangles correspond to the class frequencies. The easiest way to draw a histogram is to mark the

class mid-point values on the horizontal scale and draw the rectangles symmetrically about the appropriate class mid-point values and touching one another.

Problem 10. The amount of money earned weekly by 40 people working part-time in a factory, correct to the nearest $Â£ 10$, is shown below. Form a frequency distribution having 6 classes for these data
\begin{tabular}{|rrrrrrrr|}
\hline 80 & 90 & 70 & 110 & 90 & 160 & 110 & 80 \\
\hline 140 & 30 & 90 & 50 & 100 & 110 & 60 & 100 \\
\hline 80 & 90 & 110 & 80 & 100 & 90 & 120 & 70 \\
\hline 130 & 170 & 80 & 120 & 100 & 110 & 40 & 110 \\
\hline 50 & 100 & 110 & 90 & 100 & 70 & 110 & 80 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Inspection of the set given shows that the majority of the members of the set lie between $Â£ 80$ and $Â£ 110$ and that there is a much smaller number of extreme values ranging from $Â£ 30$ to $Â£ 170$. If equal class intervals are selected, the frequency distribution obtained does not give as much information as one with unequal class intervals. Since the majority of the members lie between $Â£ 80$ and $Â£ 100$, the class intervals in this range are selected to be smaller than those outside of this range. There is no unique solution and one possible solution is shown in Table 31.2.

Problem 11. Draw a histogram for the data given in Table 31.2

When dealing with unequal class intervals, the histogram must be drawn so that the areas (and not the heights) of the rectangles are proportional to the

Table 31.3

\hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\

In column 5, the class ranges (i.e. upper class boundary minus lower class boundary values) are listed. The heights of the rectangles are proportional to the ratio $\frac{\text { frequency }}{\text { class range }}$, as shown in column 6 . The histogram is shown in Figure 31.8.

Problem 12. The masses of 50 ingots in kilograms are measured correct to the nearest 0.1 kg and the results are as shown below. Produce a frequency distribution having about 7 classes for these data and then present the grouped data as a frequency polygon and a histogram
\begin{tabular}{|llllllllll|}
\hline 8.0 & 8.6 & 8.2 & 7.5 & 8.0 & 9.1 & 8.5 & 7.6 & 8.2 & 7.8 \\
\hline 8.3 & 7.1 & 8.1 & 8.3 & 8.7 & 7.8 & 8.7 & 8.5 & 8.4 & 8.5 \\

\hline 8.1 & 7.4 & 8.8 & 8.0 & 8.4 & 8.5 & 8.1 & 7.3 & 9.0 & 8.6 \\
7.4 & 8.2 & 8.4 & 7.7 & 8.3 & 8.2 & 7.9 & 8.5 & 7.9 & 8.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The range of the data is the member having the largest value minus the member having the smallest value. Inspection of the set of data shows that range $=9.1-$ $7.1=\mathbf{2 . 0}$.
The size of each class is given approximately by
$$\frac{\text { range }}{\text { number of classes }}$$

Since about seven classes are required, the size of each class is $2.0 \div 7$, i.e. approximately 0.3 , and thus the class limits are selected as 7.1 to $7.3,7.4$ to $7.6,7.7$ to 7.9 , and so on. The class mid-point for the 7.1 to 7.3 class is
$$\frac{7.35+7.05}{2} \text { i.e. } 7.2$$
the class midpoint for the 7.4 to 7.6 class is
$$\frac{7.65+7.35}{2} \text { i.e. } 7.5$$
and so on.

To assist with accurately determining the number in each class, a tally diagram is produced as shown in Table 31.4. This is obtained by listing the classes in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the 50 members of the set of data in turn and allocating it to the appropriate class by putting a ' 1 ' in the appropriate row. Each fifth ' 1 ' allocated to a particular row is marked as an oblique line to help with final counting.

Table 31.4
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Class & Tally \\
\hline 7.1 to 7.3 & 111 \\
\hline 7.4 to 7.6 & 141 \\

\end{tabular}

A frequency distribution for the data is shown in Table 31.5 and lists classes and their corresponding frequencies. Class mid-points are also shown in this table since they are used when constructing the frequency polygon and histogram.

A frequency polygon is shown in Figure 31.9, the co-ordinates corresponding to the class midpoint/frequency values given in Table 31.5. The coordinates are joined by straight lines and the polygon is 'anchored-down' at each end by joining to the next class mid-point value and zero frequency.

The easiest way to draw a histogram is to mark class mid-point values on the horizontal scale and to draw the rectangles symmetrically about the appropriate class mid-point values and touching one another. A histogram for the data given in Table 31.5 is shown in Figure 31.10.

Form a cumulative frequency distribution for these data and draw the corresponding ogive

A cumulative frequency distribution is a table giving values of cumulative frequency for the values of upper class boundaries and is shown in Table 31.6. Columns 1 and 2 show the classes and their frequencies. Column 3 lists the upper class boundary values for the classes given in column 1. Column 4 gives the cumulative frequency values for all frequencies less than the upper class boundary values given in column 3. Thus, for example, for the 7.7 to 7.9 class shown in row 3, the cumulative frequency value is the sum of all frequencies having values of less than 7.95 , i.e. $3+5+9=17$, and so on.

Table 31.6
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\hline Class & Frequency & Upper class boundary less than & Cumulative frequency \\

\section*{Mean, median, mode and standard deviation}

\subsection*{32.1 Measures of central tendency}

A single value, which is representative of a set of values, may be used to give an indication of the general size of the members in a set, the word 'average' often being used to indicate the single value. The statistical term used for 'average' is the 'arithmetic mean' or just the 'mean'.
Other measures of central tendency may be used and these include the median and the modal values.

\subsection*{32.2 Mean, median and mode for discrete data}

\subsection*{32.2.1 Mean}

The arithmetic mean value is found by adding together the values of the members of a set and dividing by the number of members in the set. Thus, the mean of the set of numbers $\{4,5,6,9\}$ is
$$\frac{4+5+6+9}{4} \text { i.e. } 6$$

In general, the mean of the set $\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots x_{n}\right\}$ is
$$\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n} \text { written as } \frac{\sum x}{n}$$
where $\sum$ is the Greek letter 'sigma' and means 'the sum of ' and $\bar{x}$ (called $x$-bar) is used to signify a mean value.

\subsection*{32.2.2 Median}

The median value often gives a better indication of the general size of a set containing extreme values. The set $\{7,5,74,10\}$ has a mean value of 24 , which is not really representative of any of the values of the members of the set. The median value is obtained by
(a) ranking the set in ascending order of magnitude, and
(b) selecting the value of the middle member for sets containing an odd number of members or finding the value of the mean of the two middle members for sets containing an even number of members.

For example, the set $\{7,5,74,10\}$ is ranked as $\{5,7,10,74\}$ and, since it contains an even number of members (four in this case), the mean of 7 and 10 is taken, giving a median value of 8.5 . Similarly, the set $\{3,81,15,7,14\}$ is ranked as $\{3,7,14,15,81\}$ and the median value is the value of the middle member, i.e. 14 .

\subsection*{32.2.3 Mode}

The modal value, or mode, is the most commonly occurring value in a set. If two values occur with the same frequency, the set is 'bi-modal'. The set $\{5,6,8,2,5,4,6,5,3\}$ has a modal value of 5 , since the member having a value of 5 occurs the most, i.e. three times.

Problem 1. Determine the mean, median and mode for the set $\{2,3,7,5,5,13,1,7,4,8,3,4,3\}$

The mean value is obtained by adding together the values of the members of the set and dividing by the number of members in the set. Thus,
mean value, $\bar{x}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{2+3+7+5+5+13+1+7+4+8+3+4+3}{13} \\
& =\frac{65}{13}=\mathbf{5}
\end{aligned}$$

To obtain the median value the set is ranked, that is, placed in ascending order of magnitude, and since the set contains an odd number of members the value of the middle member is the median value. Ranking the set gives $\{1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,7,7,8,13\}$. The middle term is the seventh member; i.e., 4 . Thus, the median value is 4 .
The modal value is the value of the most commonly occurring member and is $\mathbf{3}$, which occurs three times, all other members only occurring once or twice.

Problem 2. The following set of data refers to the amount of money in $Â£$ s taken by a news vendor for 6 days. Determine the mean, median and modal values of the set $\{27.90,34.70,54.40,18.92,47.60,39.68\}$

\section*{Mean value}
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{27.90+34.70+54.40+18.92+47.60+39.68}{6} \\
& =Â£ \mathbf{3 7 . 2 0}
\end{aligned}$$

The ranked set is $\{18.92,27.90,34.70,39.68,47.60,54.40\}$.
Since the set has an even number of members, the mean of the middle two members is taken to give the median value; i.e.,
$$\text { median value }=\frac{34.70+39.68}{2}=Â£ \mathbf{3 7 . 1 9}$$

Since no two members have the same value, this set has no mode.

\section*{Now try the following Practice Exercise}

\section*{Practice Exercise 125 Mean, median and mode for discrete data (answers on page 353)}

In problems 1 to 4, determine the mean, median and modal values for the sets given.

4. $\{73.8,126.4,40.7,141.7,28.5,237.4,157.9\}$

\subsection*{32.3 Mean, median and mode for grouped data}

The mean value for a set of grouped data is found by determining the sum of the (frequency $\times$ class mid-point values) and dividing by the sum of the frequencies; i.e.,
$$\text { mean value, } \bar{x}=\frac{f_{1} x_{1}+f_{2} x_{2}+\cdots f_{n} x_{n}}{f_{1}+f_{2}+\cdots+f_{n}}=\frac{\sum(f x)}{\sum f}$$
where $f$ is the frequency of the class having a mid-point value of $x$, and so on.

Problem 3. The frequency distribution for the value of resistance in ohms of 48 resistors is as shown. Determine the mean value of resistance
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$20.5-20.9$ & 3 \\
$21.0-21.4$ & 10 \\
$21.5-21.9$ & 11 \\
$22.0-22.4$ & 13 \\
$22.5-22.9$ & 9 \\
$23.0-23.4$ & 2
\end{tabular}

The class mid-point/frequency values are 20.7 3, 21.2 10, 21.7 11, $22.213,22.79$ and 23.22.

For grouped data, the mean value is given by
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum(f x)}{\sum f}$$
where $f$ is the class frequency and $x$ is the class midpoint value. Hence mean value,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \bar{x}=\frac{(3 \times 20.7)+(10 \times 21.2)+(11 \times 21.7)}{+(13 \times 22.2)+(9 \times 22.7)+(2 \times 23.2)} \\
& 48 \\
&=\frac{1052.1}{48}=21.919 \ldots
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. the mean value is $\mathbf{2 1 . 9}$ ohms, correct to 3 significant figures.

\subsection*{32.3.1 Histograms}

The mean, median and modal values for grouped data may be determined from a histogram. In a histogram,
frequency values are represented vertically and variable values horizontally. The mean value is given by the value of the variable corresponding to a vertical line drawn through the centroid of the histogram. The median value is obtained by selecting a variable value such that the area of the histogram to the left of a vertical line drawn through the selected variable value is equal to the area of the histogram on the right of the line. The modal value is the variable value obtained by dividing the width of the highest rectangle in the histogram in proportion to the heights of the adjacent rectangles. The method of determining the mean, median and modal values from a histogram is shown in Problem 4.

Problem 4. The time taken in minutes to assemble a device is measured 50 times and the results are as shown. Draw a histogram depicting the data and hence determine the mean, median and modal values of the distribution
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$14.5-15.5$ & 5 \\
$16.5-17.5$ & 8 \\
$18.5-19.5$ & 16 \\
$20.5-21.5$ & 12 \\
$22.5-23.5$ & 6 \\
$24.5-25.5$ & 3
\end{tabular}

The histogram is shown in Figure 32.1. The mean value lies at the centroid of the histogram. With reference to any arbitrary axis, say $Y Y$ shown at a time of 14 minutes, the position of the horizontal value of the centroid can be obtained from the relationship $A M=\sum(a m)$, where $A$ is the area of the histogram, $M$ is the horizontal distance of the centroid from the axis $Y Y, a$ is the area of a rectangle of the histogram and $m$ is the distance of the centroid of the rectangle from $Y Y$. The areas of the individual rectangles are shown circled
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-314.jpg?height=549&width=671&top_left_y=1854&top_left_x=294)

Figure 32.1
on the histogram giving a total area of 100 square units. The positions, $m$, of the centroids of the individual rectangles are $1,3,5, \ldots$ units from $Y Y$. Thus
$$\begin{aligned}
100 M=(10 \times 1)+(16 \times 3)+ & (32 \times 5)+(24 \times 7) \\
& +(12 \times 9)+(6 \times 11)
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $M=\frac{560}{100}=5.6$ units from $Y Y$

Thus, the position of the mean with reference to the time scale is $14+5.6$, i.e. $\mathbf{1 9 . 6}$ minutes.

The median is the value of time corresponding to a vertical line dividing the total area of the histogram into two equal parts. The total area is 100 square units, hence the vertical line must be drawn to give 50 units of area on each side. To achieve this with reference to Figure 32.1, rectangle $A B F E$ must be split so that $50-(10+16)$ units of area lie on one side and $50-(24+12+6)$ units of area lie on the other. This shows that the area of $A B F E$ is split so that 24 units of area lie to the left of the line and 8 units of area lie to the right; i.e., the vertical line must pass through 19.5 minutes. Thus, the median value of the distribution is $\mathbf{1 9 . 5}$ minutes.

The mode is obtained by dividing the line $A B$, which is the height of the highest rectangle, proportionally to the heights of the adjacent rectangles. With reference to Figure 32.1, this is achieved by joining $A C$ and $B D$ and drawing a vertical line through the point of intersection of these two lines. This gives the mode of the distribution, which is $\mathbf{1 9 . 3}$ minutes.

\subsection*{32.4 Standard deviation}

\subsection*{32.4.1 Discrete data}

The standard deviation of a set of data gives an indication of the amount of dispersion, or the scatter, of members of the set from the measure of central tendency. Its value is the root-mean-square value of the members of the set and for discrete data is obtained as follows.
(i) Determine the measure of central tendency, usually the mean value, (occasionally the median or modal values are specified).
(ii) Calculate the deviation of each member of the set from the mean, giving
$$\left(x_{1}-\bar{x}\right),\left(x_{2}-\bar{x}\right),\left(x_{3}-\bar{x}\right), \ldots$$
(iii) Determine the squares of these deviations; i.e., $\left(x_{1}-\bar{x}\right)^{2},\left(x_{2}-\bar{x}\right)^{2},\left(x_{3}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}, \ldots$
(iv) Find the sum of the squares of the deviations, i.e.
$$\left(x_{1}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{3}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}, \ldots$$
(v) Divide by the number of members in the set, $n$, giving
$$\frac{\left(x_{1}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x^{3}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\cdots}{n}$$
(vi) Determine the square root of (v).

The standard deviation is indicated by $\sigma$ (the Greek letter small 'sigma') and is written mathematically as
$$\text { standard deviation, } \sigma=\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}\right\}}$$
where $x$ is a member of the set, $\bar{x}$ is the mean value of the set and $n$ is the number of members in the set. The value of standard deviation gives an indication of the distance of the members of a set from the mean value. The set $\{1,4,7,10,13\}$ has a mean value of 7 and a standard deviation of about 4.2. The set $\{5,6,7,8,9\}$ also has a mean value of 7 but the standard deviation is about 1.4. This shows that the members of the second set are mainly much closer to the mean value than the members of the first set. The method of determining the standard deviation for a set of discrete data is shown in Problem 5.

Problem 5. Determine the standard deviation from the mean of the set of numbers $\{5,6,8,4,10,3\}$, correct to 4 significant figures

The arithmetic mean, $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}$
$$=\frac{5+6+8+4+10+3}{6}=6$$

Standard deviation, $\sigma=\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}\right\}}$
The $(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ values are $(5-6)^{2},(6-6)^{2},(8-6)^{2}$, $(4-6)^{2},(10-6)^{2}$ and $(3-6)^{2}$.

The sum of the $(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ values, i.e. $\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}$, is $1+0+4+4+16+9=34$
and $\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}=\frac{34}{6}=5 . \dot{6}$ since there are 6 members in the set.

Hence, standard deviation,
$$\sigma=\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}\right\}}=\sqrt{5 . \dot{6}}=\mathbf{2 . 3 8 0}$$
correct to 4 significant figures.

\subsection*{32.4.2 Grouped data}

For grouped data,
$$\text { standard deviation, } \sigma=\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum\left\{f(x-\bar{x})^{2}\right\}}{\sum f}\right\}}$$
where $f$ is the class frequency value, $x$ is the class midpoint value and $\bar{x}$ is the mean value of the grouped data. The method of determining the standard deviation for a set of grouped data is shown in Problem 6.

Problem 6. The frequency distribution for the values of resistance in ohms of 48 resistors is as shown. Calculate the standard deviation from the mean of the resistors, correct to 3 significant figures
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$20.5-20.9$ & 3 \\
$21.0-21.4$ & 10 \\
$21.5-21.9$ & 11 \\
$22.0-22.4$ & 13 \\
$22.5-22.9$ & 9 \\
$23.0-23.4$ & 2
\end{tabular}

The standard deviation for grouped data is given by
$$\sigma=\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum\left\{f(x-\bar{x})^{2}\right\}}{\sum f}\right\}}$$

From Problem 3, the distribution mean value is $\bar{x}=21.92$, correct to 2 significant figures.

The ' $x$-values' are the class mid-point values, i.e. 20.7, 21.2, 21.7, ...

Thus, the $(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ values are $(20.7-21.92)^{2}$, $(21.2-21.92)^{2},(21.7-21.92)^{2}, \ldots$
and the $f(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ values are $3(20.7-21.92)^{2}$, $10(21.2-21.92)^{2}, 11(21.7-21.92)^{2}, \ldots$
The $\sum f(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ values are
$$\begin{aligned}
4.4652+5.1840+0.5324 & +1.0192 \\
+5.4756+3.2768 & =19.9532 \\
\frac{\sum\left\{f(x-\bar{x})^{2}\right\}}{\sum f}=\frac{19.9532}{48} & =0.41569
\end{aligned}$$
and standard deviation,
$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma & =\sqrt{\left\{\frac{\sum\left\{f(x-\bar{x})^{2}\right\}}{\sum f}\right\}}=\sqrt{0.41569} \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 6 4 5}, \text { correct to } 3 \text { significant figures. }

\subsection*{32.5 Quartiles, deciles and percentiles}

Other measures of dispersion which are sometimes used are the quartile, decile and percentile values. The quartile values of a set of discrete data are obtained by selecting the values of members which divide the set
into four equal parts. Thus, for the set $\{2,3,4,5,5,7$, $9,11,13,14,17\}$ there are 11 members and the values of the members dividing the set into four equal parts are 4,7 and 13. These values are signified by $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ and called the first, second and third quartile values, respectively. It can be seen that the second quartile value, $Q_{2}$, is the value of the middle member and hence is the median value of the set.

For grouped data the ogive may be used to determine the quartile values. In this case, points are selected on the vertical cumulative frequency values of the ogive, such that they divide the total value of cumulative frequency into four equal parts. Horizontal lines are drawn from these values to cut the ogive. The values of the variable corresponding to these cutting points on the ogive give the quartile values (see Problem 7).

When a set contains a large number of members, the set can be split into ten parts, each containing an equal number of members. These ten parts are then called deciles. For sets containing a very large number of members, the set may be split into one hundred parts, each containing an equal number of members. One of these parts is called a percentile.

Problem 7. The frequency distribution given below refers to the overtime worked by a group of craftsmen during each of 48 working weeks in a year. Draw an ogive for these data and hence determine the quartile values.
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$25-29$ & 5 \\
$30-34$ & 4 \\
$35-39$ & 7 \\
$40-44$ & 11 \\
$45-49$ & 12 \\
$50-54$ & 8 \\
$55-59$ & 1
\end{tabular}

The cumulative frequency distribution (i.e. upper class boundary/cumulative frequency values) is
29.5 5, 34.5
9, 39.5
16, 44.527 49.5 39, $54.547,59.548$.

The ogive is formed by plotting these values on a graph, as shown in Figure 32.2. The total frequency is divided into four equal parts, each having a range of $48 \div 4$, i.e. 12. This gives cumulative frequency values of 0 to 12 corresponding to the first quartile, 12 to 24 corresponding to the second quartile, 24 to 36 corresponding to the third quartile and 36 to 48 corresponding to the fourth quartile of the distribution; i.e., the distribution

Figure 32.2
is divided into four equal parts. The quartile values are those of the variable corresponding to cumulative frequency values of 12,24 and 36 , marked $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Figure 32.2. These values, correct to the nearest hour, are $\mathbf{3 7}$ hours, $\mathbf{4 3}$ hours and $\mathbf{4 8}$ hours, respectively. The $Q_{2}$ value is also equal to the median value of the distribution. One measure of the dispersion of a distribution is called the semi-interquartile range and is given by $\left(Q_{3}-Q_{1}\right) \div 2$ and is $(48-37) \div 2$ in this case; i.e., $\mathbf{5} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}$ hours.

Problem 8. Determine the numbers contained in the (a) 41st to 50th percentile group and (b) 8th decile group of the following set of numbers.
$$\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrr}
14 & 22 & 17 & 21 & 30 & 28 & 37 & 7 & 23 & 32 \\
24 & 17 & 20 & 22 & 27 & 19 & 26 & 21 & 15 & 29
\end{array}$$

The set is ranked, giving
\begin{tabular}{rlllllllll}
7 & 14 & 15 & 17 & 17 & 19 & 20 & 21 & 21 & 22 \\
22 & 23 & 24 & 26 & 27 & 28 & 29 & 30 & 32 & 37
\end{tabular}
(a) There are 20 numbers in the set, hence the first $10 \%$ will be the two numbers 7 and 14 , the second $10 \%$ will be 15 and 17, and so on. Thus, the 41st to 50th percentile group will be the numbers 21 and 22 .
(b) The first decile group is obtained by splitting the ranked set into 10 equal groups and selecting the first group; i.e., the numbers 7 and 14 . The second decile group is the numbers 15 and 17 , and so on. Thus, the 8th decile group contains the numbers 27 and 28.

\section*{Chapter 33}

\subsection*{33.1 Introduction to probability}

\subsection*{33.1.1 Probability}

The probability of something happening is the likelihood or chance of it happening. Values of probability lie between 0 and 1 , where 0 represents an absolute impossibility and 1 represents an absolute certainty. The probability of an event happening usually lies somewhere between these two extreme values and is expressed as either a proper or decimal fraction. Examples of probability are
that a length of copper wire has zero resistance at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \quad 0$
that a fair, six-sided dice will stop with a 3 upwards $\frac{1}{6}$ or 0.1667
that a fair coin will land with a head upwards $\quad \frac{1}{2}$ or 0.5
that a length of copper wire has some resistance at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \quad 1$

If $p$ is the probability of an event happening and $q$ is the probability of the same event not happening, then the total probability is $p+q$ and is equal to unity, since it is an absolute certainty that the event either will or will not occur; i.e., $\boldsymbol{p}+\boldsymbol{q}=\mathbf{1}$.

Problem 1. Determine the probabilities of selecting at random (a) a man and (b) a woman from a crowd containing 20 men and 33 women

\section*{Probability}
(a) The probability of selecting at random a man, $p$, is given by the ratio
$\frac{\text { number of men }}{\text { number in crowd }}$
i.e. $\quad p=\frac{20}{20+33}=\frac{\mathbf{2 0}}{\mathbf{5 3}}$ or $\mathbf{0 . 3 7 7 4}$
(b) The probability of selecting at random a woman, $q$, is given by the ratio
$\frac{\text { number of women }}{\text { number in crowd }}$
i.e. $\quad q=\frac{33}{20+33}=\frac{\mathbf{3 3}}{\mathbf{5 3}}$ or $\mathbf{0 . 6 2 2 6}$
(Check: the total probability should be equal to 1 :
$p=\frac{20}{53}$ and $q=\frac{33}{53}$, thus the total probability, $p+q=\frac{20}{53}+\frac{33}{53}=1$
hence no obvious error has been made.)

\subsection*{33.1.2 Expectation}

The expectation, $E$, of an event happening is defined in general terms as the product of the probability $p$ of an event happening and the number of attempts made, $n$; i.e., $\boldsymbol{E}=\boldsymbol{p n}$.
Thus, since the probability of obtaining a 3 upwards when rolling a fair dice is $1 / 6$, the expectation of getting a 3 upwards on four throws of the dice is
$$\frac{1}{6} \times 4, \text { i.e. } \frac{2}{3}$$

Thus expectation is the average occurrence of an event.

Problem 2. Find the expectation of obtaining a 4 upwards with 3 throws of a fair dice

Expectation is the average occurrence of an event and is defined as the probability times the number of attempts. The probability, $p$, of obtaining a 4 upwards for one throw of the dice is $1 / 6$.
If 3 attempts are made, $n=3$ and the expectation, $E$, is $p n$, i.e.
$$\boldsymbol{E}=\frac{1}{6} \times 3=\frac{1}{2} \quad \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 5 0}$$

\subsection*{33.1.3 Dependent events}

A dependent event is one in which the probability of an event happening affects the probability of another ever happening. Let 5 transistors be taken at random from a batch of 100 transistors for test purposes and the probability of there being a defective transistor, $p_{1}$, be determined. At some later time, let another 5 transistors be taken at random from the 95 remaining transistors in the batch and the probability of there being a defective transistor, $p_{2}$, be determined. The value of $p_{2}$ is different from $p_{1}$ since the batch size has effectively altered from 100 to 95 ; i.e., probability $p_{2}$ is dependent on probability $p_{1}$. Since transistors are drawn and then another 5 transistors are drawn without replacing the first 5, the second random selection is said to be without replacement.

\subsection*{33.1.4 Independent events}

An independent event is one in which the probability of an event happening does not affect the probability of another event happening. If 5 transistors are taken at random from a batch of transistors and the probability of a defective transistor, $p_{1}$, is determined and the process is repeated after the original 5 have been replaced in the batch to give $p_{2}$, then $p_{1}$ is equal to $p_{2}$. Since the 5 transistors are replaced between draws, the second selection is said to be with replacement.

\subsection*{33.2 Laws of probability}

\subsection*{33.2.1 The addition law of probability}

The addition law of probability is recognized by the word 'or' joining the probabilities.
If $p_{A}$ is the probability of event $A$ happening and $p_{B}$ is the probability of event $B$ happening, the probability of event $\boldsymbol{A}$ or event $\boldsymbol{B}$ happening is given by $p_{A}+p_{B}$.

Similarly, the probability of events $\boldsymbol{A}$ or $\boldsymbol{B}$ or $\boldsymbol{C}$ or $\ldots N$ happening is given by
$$p_{A}+p_{B}+p_{C}+\cdots+p_{N}$$

\subsection*{33.2.2 The multiplication law of probability}

The multiplication law of probability is recognized by the word 'and' joining the probabilities.
If $p_{A}$ is the probability of event $A$ happening and $p_{B}$ is the probability of event $B$ happening, the probability of event $\boldsymbol{A}$ and event $\boldsymbol{B}$ happening is given by $p_{A} \times p_{B}$. Similarly, the probability of events $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\boldsymbol{C}$ and $\ldots N$ happening is given by
$$p_{A} \times p_{B} \times p_{C} \times \ldots \times p_{N}$$

Here are some worked problems to demonstrate probability.

Problem 3. Calculate the probabilities of selecting at random
(a) the winning horse in a race in which 10 horses are running and
(b) the winning horses in both the first and second races if there are 10 horses in each race
(a) Since only one of the ten horses can win, the probability of selecting at random the winning horse is
$$\frac{\text { number of winners }}{\text { number of horses }} \text {,i.e. } \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1 0}} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 1 0}$$
(b) The probability of selecting the winning horse in the first race is $\frac{1}{10}$
The probability of selecting the winning horse in the second race is $\frac{1}{10}$
The probability of selecting the winning horses in the first and second race is given by the multiplication law of probability; i.e.,
$$\text { probability }=\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{10}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1 0 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 0 1}$$

Problem 4. The probability of a component failing in one year due to excessive temperature is $1 / 20$, that due to excessive vibration is $1 / 25$ and that due to excessive humidity is $1 / 50$. Determine the probabilities that during a one-year period a component
(a) fails due to excessive temperature and excessive vibration,
(b) fails due to excessive vibration or excessive humidity,
(c) will not fail because of both excessive temperature and excessive humidity

Let $p_{A}$ be the probability of failure due to excessive temperature, then
$$p_{A}=\frac{1}{20} \quad \text { and } \quad \overline{p_{A}}=\frac{19}{20}$$
(where $\overline{p_{A}}$ is the probability of not failing)
Let $p_{B}$ be the probability of failure due to excessive vibration, then
$$p_{B}=\frac{1}{25} \quad \text { and } \quad \overline{p_{B}}=\frac{24}{25}$$

Let $p_{C}$ be the probability of failure due to excessive humidity, then
$$p_{C}=\frac{1}{50} \quad \text { and } \quad \overline{p_{C}}=\frac{49}{50}$$
(a) The probability of a component failing due to excessive temperature and excessive vibration is given by
$$p_{A} \times p_{B}=\frac{1}{20} \times \frac{1}{25}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{5 0 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 0 0 2}$$
(b) The probability of a component failing due to excessive vibration or excessive humidity is
$$p_{B}+p_{C}=\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{50}=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{5 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 0 6}$$
(c) The probability that a component will not fail due excessive temperature and will not fail due to excess humidity is
$$\overline{p_{A}} \times \overline{p_{C}}=\frac{19}{20} \times \frac{49}{50}=\frac{\mathbf{9 3 1}}{\mathbf{1 0 0 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 9 3 1}$$

Problem 5. A batch of 100 capacitors contains 73 which are within the required tolerance values and 17 which are below the required tolerance values, the remainder being above the required tolerance values. Determine the probabilities that, when randomly selecting a capacitor and then a second capacitor,
(a) both are within the required tolerance values when selecting with replacement,
(b) the first one drawn is below and the second one drawn is above the required tolerance value, when selection is without replacement
(a) The probability of selecting a capacitor within the required tolerance values is $73 / 100$. The first capacitor drawn is now replaced and a second one is drawn from the batch of 100 . The probability of this capacitor being within the required tolerance values is also $73 / 100$. Thus, the probability of selecting a capacitor within the required tolerance values for both the first and the second draw is
$$\frac{73}{100} \times \frac{73}{100}=\frac{\mathbf{5 3 2 9}}{\mathbf{1 0 0 0 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 5 3 2 9}$$
(b) The probability of obtaining a capacitor below the required tolerance values on the first draw is $17 / 100$. There are now only 99 capacitors left in the batch, since the first capacitor is not replaced. The probability of drawing a capacitor above the required tolerance values on the second draw is $10 / 99$, since there are $(100-73-17)$, i.e. 10, capacitors above the required tolerance value. Thus, the probability of randomly selecting a capacitor below the required tolerance values and subsequently randomly selecting a capacitor above the tolerance values is
$$\frac{17}{100} \times \frac{10}{99}=\frac{170}{9900}=\frac{\mathbf{1 7}}{\mathbf{9 9 0}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 0 1 7 2}$$

Here are some further worked problems on probability.
Problem 6. A batch of 40 components contains 5 which are defective. A component is drawn at random from the batch and tested and then a second component is drawn. Determine the probability that neither of the components is defective when drawn (a) with replacement and (b) without replacement
(a) With replacement

The probability that the component selected on the first draw is satisfactory is $35 / 40$ i.e. $7 / 8$. The component is now replaced and a second draw is made. The probability that this component is also satisfactory is $7 / 8$. Hence, the probability that both the first component drawn and the second component drawn are satisfactory is
$$\frac{7}{8} \times \frac{7}{8}=\frac{\mathbf{4 9}}{\mathbf{6 4}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 7 6 5 6}$$
(b) Without replacement

The probability that the first component drawn is satisfactory is $7 / 8$. There are now only 34 satisfactory components left in the batch and the batch number is 39 . Hence, the probability of
drawing a satisfactory component on the second draw is $34 / 39$. Thus, the probability that the first component drawn and the second component drawn are satisfactory i.e., neither is defective is
$$\frac{7}{8} \times \frac{34}{39}=\frac{\mathbf{2 3 8}}{\mathbf{3 1 2}} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{0 . 7 6 2 8}$$

Problem 7. A batch of 40 components contains 5 which are defective. If a component is drawn at random from the batch and tested and then a second component is drawn at random, calculate the probability of having one defective component, both (a) with replacement and (b) without replacement

The probability of having one defective component can be achieved in two ways. If $p$ is the probability of drawing a defective component and $q$ is the probability of drawing a satisfactory component, then the probability of having one defective component is given by drawing a satisfactory component and then a defective component or by drawing a defective component and then a satisfactory one; i.e., by $q \times p+p \times q$.
(a) With replacement
$$p=\frac{5}{40}=\frac{1}{8} \quad \text { and } \quad q=\frac{35}{40}=\frac{7}{8}$$

Hence, the probability of having one defective component is
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{7}{8}+\frac{7}{8} \times \frac{1}{8} \\

\end{aligned}$$

Problem 8. A box contains 74 brass washers, 86 steel washers and 40 aluminium washers. Three washers are drawn at random from the box without replacement. Determine the probability that all three are steel washers

Assume, for clarity of explanation, that a washer is drawn at random, then a second, then a third (although this assumption does not affect the results obtained). The total number of washers is
$$74+86+40, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad 200$$

The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on the first draw is $86 / 200$. There are now 85 steel washers in a batch of 199 . The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on the second draw is $85 / 199$. There are now 84 steel washers in a batch of 198 . The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on the third draw is $84 / 198$. Hence, the probability of selecting a steel washer on the first draw and the second draw and the third draw is
$$\frac{86}{200} \times \frac{85}{199} \times \frac{84}{198}=\frac{614040}{7880400}=\mathbf{0 . 0 7 7 9}$$

Problem 9. For the box of washers given in Problem 8 above, determine the probability that there are no aluminium washers drawn when three washers are drawn at random from the box without replacement

The probability of not drawing an aluminium washer on the first draw is $1-\left(\frac{40}{200}\right)$ i.e., $160 / 200$. There are now 199 washers in the batch of which 159 are not made of aluminium. Hence, the probability of not drawing an aluminium washer on the second draw is 159/199. Similarly, the probability of not drawing an aluminium washer on the third draw is $158 / 198$. Hence the probability of not drawing an aluminium washer on the first and second and third draws is
$$\frac{160}{200} \times \frac{159}{199} \times \frac{158}{198}=\frac{4019520}{7880400}=\mathbf{0 . 5 1 0 1}$$

Problem 10. For the box of washers in Problem 8 above, find the probability that there are two brass washers and either a steel or an aluminium washer when three are drawn at random, without replacement

Two brass washers ( $A$ ) and one steel washer ( $B$ ) can be obtained in any of the following ways.
\begin{tabular}{|lcc|}
\hline 1st draw & 2nd draw & 3rd draw \\
\hline$A$ & $A$ & $B$ \\
\hline$A$ & $B$ & $A$ \\
\hline$B$ & $A$ & $A$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Two brass washers and one aluminium washer ( $C$ ) can also be obtained in any of the following ways.
\begin{tabular}{|lcc|}
\hline 1st draw & 2nd draw & 3rd draw \\
\hline$A$ & $A$ & $C$ \\
\hline$A$ & $C$ & $A$ \\
$C$ & $A$ & $A$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus, there are six possible ways of achieving the combinations specified. If $A$ represents a brass washer, $B$ a steel washer and $C$ an aluminium washer, the combinations and their probabilities are as shown.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Draw} & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Probability} \\
\hline First & Second & Third & \\
\hline A & A & B & $\frac{74}{200} \times \frac{73}{199} \times \frac{86}{198}=0.0590$ \\
\hline A & B & A & $\frac{74}{200} \times \frac{86}{199} \times \frac{73}{198}=0.0590$ \\
\hline B & A & A & $\frac{86}{200} \times \frac{74}{199} \times \frac{73}{198}=0.0590$ \\
\hline A & A & C & $\frac{74}{200} \times \frac{73}{199} \times \frac{40}{198}=0.0274$ \\
\hline A & C & A & $\frac{74}{200} \times \frac{40}{199} \times \frac{73}{198}=0.0274$ \\
\hline C & A & A & $\frac{40}{200} \times \frac{74}{199} \times \frac{73}{198}=0.0274$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The probability of having the first combination or the second or the third, and so on, is given by the sum of the probabilities; i.e., by $3 \times 0.0590+3 \times 0.0274$, i.e. 0.2592

\section*{Chapter 34}

\section*{Introduction to differentiation}

\subsection*{34.1 Introduction to calculus}

Calculus is a branch of mathematics involving or leading to calculations dealing with continuously varying functions such as velocity and acceleration, rates of change and maximum and minimum values of curves. Calculus has widespread applications in science and engineering and is used to solve complicated problems for which algebra alone is insufficient.
Calculus is a subject that falls into two parts:
(a) differential calculus (or differentiation),
(b) integral calculus (or integration).

This chapter provides an introduction to differentiation and applies differentiation to rates of change. Chapter 35 introduces integration and applies it to determine areas under curves.
Further applications of differentiation and integration are explored in Engineering Mathematics (Bird, 2010).

\subsection*{34.2 Functional notation}

In an equation such as $y=3 x^{2}+2 x-5, y$ is said to be a function of $x$ and may be written as $y=f(x)$.
An equation written in the form $f(x)=3 x^{2}+2 x-5$ is termed functional notation. The value of $f(x)$ when $x=0$ is denoted by $f(0)$, and the value of $f(x)$ when $x=2$ is denoted by $f(2)$, and so on. Thus, when $f(x)=3 x^{2}+2 x-5$,
$$f(0)=3(0)^{2}+2(0)-5=-5$$
and $\quad f(2)=3(2)^{2}+2(2)-5=11$, and so on.

Problem 1. If $f(x)=4 x^{2}-3 x+2$, find $f(0), f(3), f(-1)$ and $f(3)-f(-1)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=4 x^{2}-3 x+2 \\
& \boldsymbol{f}(\mathbf{0})=4(0)^{2}-3(0)+2=\mathbf{2} \\
& \boldsymbol{f}(\mathbf{3})=4(3)^{2}-3(3)+2=36-9+2=\mathbf{2 9} \\
& \boldsymbol{f}(\mathbf{- 1})=4(-1)^{2}-3(-1)+2=4+3+2=\mathbf{9} \\
& \boldsymbol{f}(\mathbf{3})-\boldsymbol{f}(\mathbf{- 1})=29-9=\mathbf{2 0}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 2. Given that $f(x)=5 x^{2}+x-7$, determine (a) $f(-2)$ (b) $f(2) \div f(1)$
(a) $f(-2)=5(-2)^{2}+(-2)-7=20-2-7=\mathbf{1 1}$
(b) $f(2)=5(2)^{2}+2-7=15$
$f(1)=5(1)^{2}+1-7=-1$
$f(\mathbf{2}) \div f(\mathbf{1})=\frac{15}{-1}=\mathbf{- 1 5}$

\subsection*{34.3 The gradient of a curve}

If a tangent is drawn at a point $P$ on a curve, the gradient of this tangent is said to be the gradient of the curve at $P$. In Figure 34.1, the gradient of the curve at $P$ is equal to the gradient of the tangent $P Q$.

Figure 34.1
For the curve shown in Figure 34.2, let the points $A$ and $B$ have co-ordinates $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$, respectively. In functional notation, $y_{1}=f\left(x_{1}\right)$ and $y_{2}=f\left(x_{2}\right)$, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-327.jpg?height=416&width=451&top_left_y=1522&top_left_x=428)

The gradient of the chord $A B$
$$=\frac{B C}{A C}=\frac{B D-C D}{E D}=\frac{f\left(x_{2}\right)-f\left(x_{1}\right)}{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)}$$

For the curve $f(x)=x^{2}$ shown in Figure 34.3,
(a) the gradient of chord $A B$
$$=\frac{f(3)-f(1)}{3-1}=\frac{9-1}{2}=4$$

Figure 34.3
(b) the gradient of chord $A C$
$$=\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\frac{4-1}{1}=3$$
(c) the gradient of chord $A D$
$$=\frac{f(1.5)-f(1)}{1.5-1}=\frac{2.25-1}{0.5}=2.5$$
(d) if $E$ is the point on the curve $(1.1, f(1.1))$ then the gradient of chord $A E$
$$=\frac{f(1.1)-f(1)}{1.1-1}=\frac{1.21-1}{0.1}=2.1$$
(e) if $F$ is the point on the curve $(1.01, f(1.01))$ then the gradient of chord $A F$
$$=\frac{f(1.01)-f(1)}{1.01-1}=\frac{1.0201-1}{0.01}=2.01$$

Thus, as point $B$ moves closer and closer to point $A$, the gradient of the chord approaches nearer and nearer to the value 2 . This is called the limiting value of the gradient of the chord $A B$ and when $B$ coincides with $A$ the chord becomes the tangent to the curve.

chord $J K$. By moving $J$ nearer and nearer to $K$, determine the gradient of the tangent of the curve at $K$.

\subsection*{34.4 Differentiation from first principles}

In Figure 34.4, $A$ and $B$ are two points very close together on a curve, $\delta x$ (delta $x$ ) and $\delta y$ (delta $y$ ) representing small increments in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-328.jpg?height=453&width=551&top_left_y=964&top_left_x=351)

Figure 34.4
Gradient of chord $\quad A B=\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$
$\begin{array}{ll}\text { however, } & \delta y=f(x+\delta x)-f(x) \\ \delta y & f(x+\delta x)-f(x)\end{array}$
Hence, $\quad \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}$
As $\delta x$ approaches zero, $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$ approaches a limiting value and the gradient of the chord approaches the gradient of the tangent at $A$.
When determining the gradient of a tangent to a curve there are two notations used. The gradient of the curve at $A$ in Figure 34.4 can either be written as
$$\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \quad \text { or } \quad \operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}\right\}$$

In Leibniz notation, $\frac{d y}{d x}=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$
In functional notation,
$$f^{\prime}(x)=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}\right\}$$
$\frac{d y}{d x}$ is the same as $f^{\prime}(x)$ and is called the differential coefficient or the derivative. The process of finding the differential coefficient is called differentiation.
Summarizing, the differential coefficient,
$\frac{d y}{d x}=f^{\prime}(x)=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}\right\}$

Problem 3. Differentiate from first principles $f(x)=x^{2}$

To 'differentiate from first principles' means 'to find $f^{\prime}(x)$ ' using the expression
$$f^{\prime}(x)=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}\right\}$$
$f(x)=x^{2}$ and substituting $(x+\delta x)$ for $x$ gives $f(x+\delta x)=(x+\delta x)^{2}=x^{2}+2 x \delta x+\delta x^{2}$, hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
f^{\prime}(x) & =\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{\left(x^{2}+2 x \delta x+\delta x^{2}\right)-\left(x^{2}\right)}{\delta x}\right\} \\
& =\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\left\{\frac{2 x \delta x+\delta x^{2}}{\delta x}\right\}=\operatorname{limit}_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}\{2 x+\delta x\}
\end{aligned}$$

As $\delta x \rightarrow 0,\{2 x+\delta x\} \rightarrow\{2 x+0\}$.
Thus, $f^{\prime}(x)=2 x$ i.e. the differential coefficient of $x^{2}$ is $2 x$.
This means that the general equation for the gradient of the curve $f(x)=x^{2}$ is $2 x$. If the gradient is required at, say, $x=3$, then gradient $=2(3)=\mathbf{6}$.
Differentiation from first principles can be a lengthy process and we do not want to have to go through this procedure every time we want to differentiate a function. In reality we do not have to because from the above procedure has evolved a set general rule, which we consider in the following section.

\subsection*{34.5 Differentiation of $y=a x^{n}$ by the general rule}

From differentiation by first principles, a general rule for differentiating $a x^{n}$ emerges where $a$ and $n$ are any constants. This rule is
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { if } y=a x^{n} \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=a n x^{n-1} \\
& \text { or } \quad \text { if } f(x)=a x^{n} \text { then } f^{\prime}(x)=a n x^{n-1}
\end{aligned}$$

When differentiating, results can be expressed in a number of ways. For example,
(a) if $y=3 x^{2}$ then $\frac{d y}{d x}=6 x$
(b) if $f(x)=3 x^{2}$ then $f^{\prime}(x)=6 x$
(c) the differential coefficient of $3 x^{2}$ is $6 x$
(d) the derivative of $3 x^{2}$ is $6 x$
(e) $\frac{d}{d x}\left(3 x^{2}\right)=6 x$

\subsection*{34.5.1 Revision of some laws of indices}
$\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\boldsymbol{x}^{\boldsymbol{a}}}=\boldsymbol{x}^{-\boldsymbol{a}} \quad$ For example, $\frac{1}{x^{2}}=x^{-2}$ and $x^{-5}=\frac{1}{x^{5}}$
$\sqrt{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}} \quad$ For example, $\sqrt{5}=5^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $16^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{16}= \pm 4$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}=\frac{1}{x^{\frac{1}{2}}}=x^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
$\sqrt[a]{x^{b}}=x^{\frac{b}{a}} \quad$ For example, $\sqrt[3]{x^{5}}=x^{\frac{5}{3}}$ and $x^{\frac{4}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{x^{4}}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^{7}}}=\frac{1}{x^{\frac{7}{3}}}=x^{-\frac{7}{3}}$
$\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{0}}=\mathbf{1} \quad$ For example, $7^{0}=1$ and $43.5^{0}=1$
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate the general rule for differentiating $y=a x^{n}$.

Problem 4. Differentiate the following with respect to $x: y=4 x^{7}$

Comparing $y=4 x^{7}$ with $y=a x^{n}$ shows that $a=4$ and $n=7$. Using the general rule,
$$\frac{d y}{d x}=a n x^{n-1}=(4)(7) x^{7-1}=\mathbf{2 8} \boldsymbol{x}^{6}$$

Problem 5. Differentiate the following with respect to $x: y=\frac{3}{x^{2}}$
$y=\frac{3}{x^{2}}=3 x^{-2}$, hence $a=3$ and $n=-2$ in the general rule.
$$\frac{d y}{d x}=a n x^{n-1}=(3)(-2) x^{-2-1}=-6 x^{-3}=-\frac{6}{x^{3}}$$

Problem 6. Differentiate the following with respect to $x: y=5 \sqrt{x}$
$y=5 \sqrt{x}=5 x^{\frac{1}{2}}$, hence $a=5$ and $n=\frac{1}{2}$ in the general rule.
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d y}{d x}=a n x^{n-1} & =(5)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) x^{\frac{1}{2}-1} \\
& =\frac{5}{2} x^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{5}{2 x^{\frac{1}{2}}}=\frac{\mathbf{5}}{2 \sqrt{x}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. Differentiate $y=4$
$y=4$ may be written as $y=4 x^{0}$; i.e., in the general rule $a=4$ and $n=0$. Hence,
$$\frac{\boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{y}}{\boldsymbol{d x}}=(4)(0) x^{0-1}=\mathbf{0}$$

The equation $y=4$ represents a straight horizontal line and the gradient of a horizontal line is zero, hence the result could have been determined on inspection. In general, the differential coefficient of a constant is always zero.

\section*{Problem 8. Differentiate $y=7 x$}

Since $y=7 x$, i.e. $y=7 x^{1}$, in the general rule $a=7$ and $n=1$. Hence,
$$\frac{d y}{d x}=(7)(1) x^{1-1}=7 x^{0}=7 \quad \text { since } x^{0}=1$$

The gradient of the line $y=7 x$ is 7 (from $y=m x+c$ ), hence the result could have been obtained by inspection. In general, the differential coefficient of $k x$, where $k$ is a constant, is always $k$.

Problem 9. Find the differential coefficient of
$$y=\frac{2}{3} x^{4}-\frac{4}{x^{3}}+9$$
$$\begin{aligned}
y & =\frac{2}{3} x^{4}-\frac{4}{x^{3}}+9 \\
\text { i.e. } \quad y & =\frac{2}{3} x^{4}-4 x^{-3}+9 \\
\frac{d y}{d x} & =\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(4) x^{4-1}-(4)(-3) x^{-3-1}+0 \\
& =\frac{8}{3} x^{3}+12 x^{-4}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\text { i.e. } \quad \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{8}{3} x^{3}+\frac{12}{x^{4}}$$

Problem 10. If $f(t)=4 t+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t^{3}}}$ find $f^{\prime}(t)$
$$f(t)=4 t+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t^{3}}}=4 t+\frac{1}{t^{\frac{3}{2}}}=4 t^{1}+t^{-\frac{3}{2}}$$

Hence, $\quad f^{\prime}(t)=(4)(1) t^{1-1}+\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) t^{-\frac{3}{2}-1}$
$$=4 t^{0}-\frac{3}{2} t^{-\frac{5}{2}}$$
i.e. $\quad f^{\prime}(t)=4-\frac{3}{2 t^{\frac{5}{2}}}=4-\frac{3}{2 \sqrt{t^{5}}}$

Problem 11. Determine $\frac{d y}{d x}$ given $y=\frac{3 x^{2}-5 x}{2 x}$
$$y=\frac{3 x^{2}-5 x}{2 x}=\frac{3 x^{2}}{2 x}-\frac{5 x}{2 x}=\frac{3}{2} x-\frac{5}{2}$$

Hence, $\quad \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{2}$ or $\mathbf{1 . 5}$
Problem 12. Find the differential coefficient of
$$y=\frac{2}{5} x^{3}-\frac{4}{x^{3}}+4 \sqrt{x^{5}}+7$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
& y= \frac{2}{5} x^{3}-\frac{4}{x^{3}}+4 \sqrt{x^{5}}+7 \\
& y= \frac{2}{5} x^{3}-4 x^{-3}+4 x^{\frac{5}{2}}+7 \\
& \frac{d y}{d x}=\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)(3) x^{3-1}-(4)(-3) x^{-3-1} \\
& \quad+(4)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) x^{\frac{5}{2}-1}+0 \\
&= \frac{6}{5} x^{2}+12 x^{-4}+10 x^{\frac{3}{2}}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{6}{5} x^{2}+\frac{12}{x^{4}}+10 \sqrt{x^{3}}$

Problem 13. Differentiate $y=\frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x}$ with respect to $x$
$$y=\frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x}=\frac{x^{2}+4 x+4}{x}=\frac{x^{2}}{x}+\frac{4 x}{x}+\frac{4}{x}$$
i.e. $\quad y=x^{1}+4+4 x^{-1}$

Hence, $\frac{\boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{y}}{\boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{x}}=1 x^{1-1}+0+(4)(-1) x^{-1-1}$
$$=x^{0}-4 x^{-2}=\mathbf{1}-\frac{\mathbf{4}}{\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}} \quad\left(\text { since } x^{0}=1\right)$$

Problem 14. Find the gradient of the curve $y=2 x^{2}-\frac{3}{x}$ at $x=2$
$$\begin{aligned}
y & =2 x^{2}-\frac{3}{x}=2 x^{3}-3 x^{-1} \\
\text { Gradient }=\frac{d y}{d x} & =(2)(2) x^{2-1}-(3)(-1) x^{-1-1} \\
& =4 x+3 x^{-2} \\
& =4 x+\frac{3}{x^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

When $\boldsymbol{x}=2, \quad$ gradient $=4 x+\frac{3}{x^{2}}=4(2)+\frac{3}{(2)^{2}}$
$$=8+\frac{3}{4}=\mathbf{8 . 7 5}$$

Problem 15. Find the gradient of the curve $y=3 x^{4}-2 x^{2}+5 x-2$ at the points $(0,-2)$ and $(1,4)$

The gradient of a curve at a given point is given by the corresponding value of the derivative.
Thus, since $y=3 x^{4}-2 x^{2}+5 x-2$,
the gradient $=\frac{d y}{d x}=12 x^{3}-4 x+5$.
At the point $(0,-2), x=0$, thus the gradient $=12(0)^{3}-4(0)+5=\mathbf{5}$
At the point $(1,4), x=1$, thus the gradient $=12(1)^{3}-4(1)+5=\mathbf{1 3}$

\subsection*{34.6 Differentiation of sine and cosine functions}

Figure 34.5(a) shows a graph of $y=\sin x$. The gradient is continually changing as the curve moves from 0 to

Figure 34.5
$A$ to $B$ to $C$ to $D$. The gradient, given by $\frac{d y}{d x}$, may be plotted in a corresponding position below $y=\sin x$, as shown in Figure 34.5(b).
At 0 , the gradient is positive and is at its steepest. Hence, $0^{\prime}$ is a maximum positive value. Between 0 and $A$ the gradient is positive but is decreasing in value until at $A$ the gradient is zero, shown as $A^{\prime}$. Between $A$ and $B$ the gradient is negative but is increasing in value until at $B$ the gradient is at its steepest. Hence $B^{\prime}$ is a maximum negative value.
If the gradient of $y=\sin x$ is further investigated between $B$ and $C$ and $C$ and $D$ then the resulting graph of $\frac{d y}{d x}$ is seen to be a cosine wave.
Hence the rate of change of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$, i.e.
$$\text { if } y=\sin x \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=\cos x$$

It may also be shown that
$$\text { if } y=\sin a x, \frac{d y}{d x}=a \cos a x$$
(where $a$ is a constant)
$$\text { and if } y=\sin (a x+\alpha), \frac{d y}{d x}=a \cos (a x+\alpha)$$
(where $a$ and $\alpha$ are constants). If a similar exercise is followed for $y=\cos x$ then the graphs of Figure 34.6 result, showing $\frac{d y}{d x}$ to be a graph of $\sin x$ but displaced by $\pi$ radians.

Figure 34.6
If each point on the curve $y=\sin x$ (as shown in Figure 34.5(a)) were to be made negative (i.e. $+\frac{\pi}{2}$ made $-\frac{\pi}{2},-\frac{3 \pi}{2}$ made $+\frac{3 \pi}{2}$, and so on) then the graph shown in Figure 34.6(b) would result. This latter graph therefore represents the curve of $-\sin x$. Thus,
$$\text { if } y=\cos x, \frac{d y}{d x}=-\sin x$$

It may also be shown that
$$\text { if } y=\cos a x, \frac{d y}{d x}=-a \sin a x$$
(where $a$ is a constant)
and if $y=\cos (a x+\alpha), \frac{d y}{d x}=-a \sin (a x+\alpha)$
(where $a$ and $\alpha$ are constants).

Problem 19. An alternating voltage is given by $v=100 \sin 200 t$ volts, where $t$ is the time in seconds. Calculate the rate of change of voltage when (a) $t=0.005 \mathrm{~s}$ and (b) $t=0.01 \mathrm{~s}$
$v=100 \sin 200 t$ volts. The rate of change of $v$ is given by $\frac{d v}{d t}$
$$\frac{d v}{d t}=(100)(200 \cos 200 t)=20000 \cos 200 t$$
(a) When $t=0.005 \mathrm{~s}$,
$$\frac{d v}{d t}=20000 \cos (200)(0.005)=20000 \cos 1$$
cos 1 means 'the cosine of 1 radian' (make sure your calculator is on radians, not degrees). Hence,
$$\frac{d v}{d t}=10806 \text { volts per second }$$
(b) When $t=0.01 \mathrm{~s}$,
$$\frac{d v}{d t}=20000 \cos (200)(0.01)=20000 \cos 2 .$$

Hence,
$$\frac{d v}{d t}=-8323 \text { volts per second }$$

\subsection*{34.7 Differentiation of $e^{a x}$ and $\ln a x$}

A graph of $y=e^{x}$ is shown in Figure 34.7(a). The gradient of the curve at any point is given by $\frac{d y}{d x}$ and is continually changing. By drawing tangents to the curve at many points on the curve and measuring the gradient of the tangents, values of $\frac{d y}{d x}$ for corresponding values of $x$ may be obtained. These values are shown graphically in Figure 34.7(b).
The graph of $\frac{d y}{d x}$ against $x$ is identical to the original graph of $y=e^{x}$. It follows that
$$\text { if } y=e^{x}, \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=e^{x}$$

It may also be shown that
$$\text { if } y=e^{a x}, \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=a e^{a x}$$

Therefore,
$$\text { if } y=2 e^{6 x} \text {, then } \frac{d y}{d x}=(2)\left(6 e^{6 x}\right)=\mathbf{1 2} e^{6 x}$$

A graph of $y=\ln x$ is shown in Figure 34.8(a). The gradient of the curve at any point is given by $\frac{d y}{d x}$ and is continually changing. By drawing tangents to the curve at many points on the curve and measuring the gradient of the tangents, values of $\frac{d y}{d x}$ for corresponding values of $x$ may be obtained. These values are shown graphically in Figure 34.8(b).
The graph of $\frac{d y}{d x}$ against $x$ is the graph of $\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{1}{x}$ It follows that
$$\text { if } y=\ln x, \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{1}{x}$$

It may also be shown that
$$\text { if } y=\ln a x \text {, then } \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{1}{x}$$
(Note that, in the latter expression, the constant $a$ does not appear in the $\frac{d y}{d x}$ term.) Thus,
$$\text { if } y=\ln 4 x, \text { then } \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{1}{x}$$

\subsection*{34.9 Successive differentiation}

When a function $y=f(x)$ is differentiated with respect to $x$, the differential coefficient is written as $\frac{d y}{d x}$ or $f^{\prime}(x)$. If the expression is differentiated again, the second differential coefficient is obtained and is written as $\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}$ (pronounced dee two $y$ by dee $x$ squared) or $f^{\prime \prime}(x)$ (pronounced $f$ double-dash $x$ ). By successive differentiation further higher derivatives such as $\frac{d^{3} y}{d x^{3}}$ and $\frac{d^{4} y}{d x^{4}}$ may be obtained. Thus,
if $y=5 x^{4}, \frac{d y}{d x}=20 x^{3}, \frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=60 x^{2}, \frac{d^{3} y}{d x^{3}}=120 x$, $\frac{d^{4} y}{d x^{4}}=120$ and $\frac{d^{5} y}{d x^{5}}=0$

\subsection*{34.10 Rates of change}

If a quantity $y$ depends on and varies with a quantity $x$ then the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ is $\frac{d y}{d x}$. Thus, for example, the rate of change of pressure $p$ with height $h$ is $\frac{d p}{d h}$
A rate of change with respect to time is usually just called 'the rate of change', the 'with respect to time' being assumed. Thus, for example, a rate of change of current, $i$, is $\frac{d i}{d t}$ and a rate of change of temperature, $\theta$, is $\frac{d \theta}{d t}$, and so on.
Here are some worked problems to demonstrate practical examples of rates of change.

Problem 26. The length $L$ metres of a certain metal rod at temperature $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by $L=1+0.00003 t+0.0000004 t^{2}$. Determine the rate of change of length, in $\mathrm{mm} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, when the temperature is (a) $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (b) $250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

The rate of change of length means $\frac{d L}{d t}$
Since length $L=1+0.00003 t+0.0000004 t^{2}$, then
$$\frac{d L}{d t}=0.00003+0.0000008 t$$
(a) When $\boldsymbol{t}=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d L}{d t} & =0.00003+(0.0000008)(100) \\
& =0.00011 \mathrm{~m} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\mathbf{0 . 1 1} \mathbf{m m} /{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) When $t=250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d L}{d t} & =0.00003+(0.0000008)(250) \\
& =0.00023 \mathrm{~m} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\mathbf{0 . 2 3} \mathbf{m m} /{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C} .
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 27. The luminous intensity $I$ candelas of a lamp at varying voltage $V$ is given by $I=5 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~V}^{2}$. Determine the voltage at which the light is increasing at a rate of 0.4 candelas per volt

The rate of change of light with respect to voltage is given by $\frac{d I}{d V}$
Since $I=5 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~V}^{2}$,
$\frac{d I}{d V}=\left(5 \times 10^{-4}\right)(2 \mathrm{~V})=10 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~V}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~V}$.

When the light is increasing at 0.4 candelas per volt then $+0.4=10^{-3} \mathrm{~V}$, from which
voltage, $\boldsymbol{V}=\frac{0.4}{10^{-3}}=0.4 \times 10^{+3}=\mathbf{4 0 0}$ volts

Problem 28. Newton's law of cooling is given by $\theta=\theta_{0} e^{-k t}$, where the excess of temperature at zero time is $\theta_{0}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at time $t$ seconds is $\theta^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Determine the rate of change of temperature after 50 s , given that $\theta_{0}=15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $k=-0.02$

The rate of change of temperature is $\frac{d \theta}{d t}$
$$\text { Since } \theta=\theta_{0} e^{-k t}, \text { then } \begin{aligned}
\frac{d \theta}{d t} & =\left(\theta_{0}\right)\left(-k e^{-k t}\right) \\
& =-k \theta_{0} e^{-k t}
\end{aligned}$$

When $\theta_{0}=15, k=-0.02$ and $t=50$, then
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \theta}{d t} & =-(-0.02)(15) e^{-(-0.02)(50)} \\
& =0.30 e^{1}=\mathbf{0 . 8 1 5}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C} / \mathbf{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 29. The pressure $p$ of the atmosphere at height $h$ above ground level is given by $p=p_{0} e^{-h / c}$, where $p_{0}$ is the pressure at ground level and $c$ is a constant. Determine the rate of change of pressure with height when $p_{0}=10^{5}$ pascals and $c=6.2 \times 10^{4}$ at 1550 metres

The rate of change of pressure with height is $\frac{d p}{d h}$
Since $p=p_{0} e^{-h / c}$, then

Introduction to integration

\subsection*{35.1 The process of integration}

The process of integration reverses the process of differentiation. In differentiation, if $f(x)=2 x^{2}$ then $f^{\prime}(x)=4 x$. Thus, the integral of $4 x$ is $2 x^{2}$; i.e., integration is the process of moving from $f^{\prime}(x)$ to $f(x)$. By similar reasoning, the integral of $2 t$ is $t^{2}$.
Integration is a process of summation or adding parts together and an elongated $S$, shown as $\int$, is used to replace the words 'the integral of'. Hence, from above, $\int 4 x=2 x^{2}$ and $\int 2 t$ is $t^{2}$.
In differentiation, the differential coefficient $\frac{d y}{d x}$ indicates that a function of $x$ is being differentiated with respect to $x$, the $d x$ indicating that it is 'with respect to $x$ '.
In integration the variable of integration is shown by adding $d$ (the variable) after the function to be integrated. Thus,
$\int 4 x d x$ means 'the integral of $4 x$ with respect to $x$ ', and $\int 2 t d t$ means 'the integral of $2 t$ with respect to $t$ '

As stated above, the differential coefficient of $2 x^{2}$ is $4 x$, hence; $\int 4 x d x=2 x^{2}$. However, the differential coefficient of $2 x^{2}+7$ is also $4 x$. Hence, $\int 4 x d x$ could also be equal to $2 x^{2}+7$. To allow for the possible presence of a constant, whenever the process of integration is performed a constant $c$ is added to the result. Thus,
$$\int 4 x d x=2 x^{2}+c \text { and } \int 2 t d t=t^{2}+c$$
$c$ is called the arbitrary constant of integration.

\subsection*{35.2 The general solution of integrals of the form $a x^{n}$}

The general solution of integrals of the form $\int a x^{n} d x$, where $a$ and $n$ are constants and $n \neq-1$ is given by
$$\int a x^{n} d x=\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c$$

Using this rule gives
(i) $\int 3 x^{4} d x=\frac{3 x^{4+1}}{4+1}+c=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{5}} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{5}}+\boldsymbol{c}$
(ii) $\int \frac{4}{9} t^{3} d t d x=\frac{4}{9}\left(\frac{t^{3+1}}{3+1}\right)+c=\frac{4}{9}\left(\frac{t^{4}}{4}\right)+c$
$$=\frac{1}{9} t^{4}+c$$
(iii) $\int \frac{2}{x^{2}} d x=\int 2 x^{-2} d x=\frac{2 x^{-2+1}}{-2+1}+c$
$$=\frac{2 x^{-1}}{-1}+c=-\frac{2}{x}+c$$
(iv) $\int \sqrt{x} d x=\int x^{\frac{1}{2}} d x=\frac{x^{\frac{1}{2}+1}}{\frac{1}{2}+1}+c=\frac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}}+c$
$$=\frac{2}{3} \sqrt{x^{3}}+c$$

Each of these results may be checked by differentiation.
(a) The integral of a constant $k$ is $k x+c$. For example,
$$\int 8 d x=8 x+c \quad \text { and } \quad \int 5 d t=5 t+c$$
(b) When a sum of several terms is integrated the result is the sum of the integrals of the separate terms. For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \int\left(3 x+2 x^{2}-5\right) d x \\
& \quad=\int 3 x d x+\int 2 x^{2} d x-\int 5 d x \\
& \quad=\frac{3 x^{2}}{2}+\frac{\mathbf{2} x^{3}}{\mathbf{3}}-\mathbf{5} x+c
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{35.3 Standard integrals}

From Chapter 34, $\frac{d}{d x}(\sin a x)=a \cos a x$. Since integration is the reverse process of differentiation, it follows that
$$\int a \cos a x d x=\sin a x+c$$
or
$$\int \cos a x d x=\frac{1}{a} \sin a x+c$$

By similar reasoning
$$\begin{aligned}
\int \sin a x d x & =-\frac{1}{a} \cos a x+c \\
\int e^{a x} d x & =\frac{1}{a} e^{a x}+c
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$\int \frac{1}{x} d x=\ln x+c$$

From above, $\int a x^{n} d x=\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c$ except when
$$n=-1$$

When $n=-1, \quad \int x^{-1} d x=\int \frac{1}{x} d x=\ln x+c$
A list of standard integrals is summarized in Table 35.1.

Table 35.1 Standard integrals
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$y$ & $\int y d x$ \\
1. $\int a x^{n}$ & $\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c($ except when $n=-1)$
\end{tabular}
2. $\int \cos a x d x \quad \frac{1}{a} \sin a x+c$
3. $\int \sin a x d x \quad-\frac{1}{a} \cos a x+c$
4. $\int e^{a x} d x \quad \frac{1}{a} e^{a x}+c$
5. $\int \frac{1}{x} d x \quad \ln x+c$

\section*{Problem 1. Determine $\int 7 x^{2} d x$}

The standard integral, $\int a x^{n} d x=\frac{a x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c$
When $a=7$ and $n=2$,
$$\int 7 x^{2} d x=\frac{7 x^{2+1}}{2+1}+c=\frac{7 x^{\mathbf{3}}}{\mathbf{3}}+\boldsymbol{c} \text { or } \frac{\mathbf{7}}{\mathbf{3}} x^{\mathbf{3}}+\boldsymbol{c}$$

\section*{Problem 2. Determine $\int 2 t^{3} d t$}

When $a=2$ and $n=3$,
$$\int 2 t^{3} d t=\frac{2 t^{3+1}}{3+1}+c=\frac{2 t^{4}}{4}+c=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}} t^{4}+c$$

Note that each of the results in worked examples 1 and 2 may be checked by differentiating them.

Problem 3. Determine $\int 8 d x$
$\int 8 d x$ is the same as $\int 8 x^{0} d x$ and, using the general rule when $a=8$ and $n=0$, gives
$$\int 8 x^{0} d x=\frac{8 x^{0+1}}{0+1}+c=8 \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$$

In general, if $k$ is a constant then $\int \boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$.

\section*{Problem 4. Determine $\int 2 x d x$}

When $a=2$ and $n=1$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 2 x d x=\int 2 x^{1} d x=\frac{2 x^{1+1}}{1+1}+c & =\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+c \\
& =x^{2}+c
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. Determine $\int\left(3+\frac{2}{5} x-6 x^{2}\right) d x$
$\int\left(3+\frac{2}{5} x-6 x^{2}\right) d x$ may be written as $\int 3 d x+\int \frac{2}{5} x d x-\int 6 x^{2} d x$
i.e., each term is integrated separately. (This splitting up of terms only applies, however, for addition and
subtraction.) Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \int\left(3+\frac{2}{5} x-6 x^{2}\right) d x \\
& \quad=3 x+\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \frac{x^{1+1}}{1+1}-(6) \frac{x^{2+1}}{2+1}+c \\
& \quad=3 x+\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \frac{x^{2}}{2}-(6) \frac{x^{3}}{3}+c=3 x+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{5} x^{2}-\mathbf{2} x^{3}+c
\end{aligned}$$

Note that when an integral contains more than one term there is no need to have an arbitrary constant for each; just a single constant $c$ at the end is sufficient.

Problem 6. Determine $\int\left(\frac{2 x^{3}-3 x}{4 x}\right) d x$

Rearranging into standard integral form gives
$$\begin{aligned}
& \int\left(\frac{2 x^{3}-3 x}{4 x}\right) d x=\int\left(\frac{2 x^{3}}{4 x}-\frac{3 x}{4 x}\right) d x \\
& =\int\left(\frac{1}{2} x^{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) d x=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{x^{2+1}}{2+1}-\frac{3}{4} x+c \\
& =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{x^{3}}{3}-\frac{3}{4} x+c=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{6}} x^{3}-\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{4}} x+c
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 7. Determine $\int(1-t)^{2} d t$}

Rearranging $\int(1-t)^{2} d t$ gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\int\left(1-2 t+t^{2}\right) d t & =t-\frac{2 t^{1+1}}{1+1}+\frac{t^{2+1}}{2+1}+c \\
& =t-\frac{2 t^{2}}{2}+\frac{t^{3}}{3}+c \\
& =t-t^{2}+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}} t^{3}+c
\end{aligned}$$

This example shows that functions often have to be rearranged into the standard form of $\int a x^{n} d x$ before it is possible to integrate them.

Problem 8. Determine $\int \frac{5}{x^{2}} d x$
$$\int \frac{5}{x^{2}} d x=\int 5 x^{-2} d x$$

Using the standard integral, $\int a x^{n} d x$, when $a=5$ and $n=-2$, gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 5 x^{-2} d x & =\frac{5 x^{-2+1}}{-2+1}+c=\frac{5 x^{-1}}{-1}+c \\
& =-5 x^{-1}+c=-\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\boldsymbol{x}}+c
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 9. Determine $\int 3 \sqrt{x} d x$}

For fractional powers it is necessary to appreciate $\sqrt[n]{a^{m}}=a^{\frac{m}{n}}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 3 \sqrt{x} d x=\int 3 x^{\frac{1}{2}} d x & =\frac{3 x^{\frac{1}{2}+1}}{\frac{1}{2}+1}+c=\frac{3 x^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}}+c \\
& =2 x^{\frac{3}{2}}+c=\mathbf{2} \sqrt{x^{3}}+c
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 10. Determine $\int \frac{-5}{9 \sqrt[4]{t^{3}}} d t$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{-5}{9 \sqrt[4]{t^{3}}} d t & =\int \frac{-5}{9 t^{\frac{3}{4}}} d t=\int\left(-\frac{5}{9}\right) t^{-\frac{3}{4}} d t \\
& =\left(-\frac{5}{9}\right) \frac{t^{-\frac{3}{4}+1}}{-\frac{3}{4}+1}+c \\
=\left(-\frac{5}{9}\right) \frac{t^{\frac{1}{4}}}{\frac{1}{4}}+c & =\left(-\frac{5}{9}\right)\left(\frac{4}{1}\right) t^{\frac{1}{4}}+c \\
& =-\frac{\mathbf{2 0}}{\mathbf{9}} \sqrt[4]{t}+\boldsymbol{c}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 11. Determine $\int 4 \cos 3 x d x$}

From 2 of Table 35.1,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 4 \cos 3 x d x & =(4)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \sin 3 x+c \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{4}}{\mathbf{3}} \sin 3 x+c
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 12. Determine $\int 5 \sin 2 \theta d \theta$

From 3 of Table 35.1,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 5 \sin 2 \theta d \theta & =(5)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cos 2 \theta+c \\
& =-\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{2}} \cos \mathbf{2 \theta}+\boldsymbol{c}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Problem 13. Determine $\int 5 e^{3 x} d x$}

From 4 of Table 35.1,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int 5 e^{3 x} d x & =(5)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) e^{3 x}+c \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{5}}{\mathbf{3}} e^{3 x}+\boldsymbol{c}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 14. Determine $\int \frac{2}{3 e^{4 t}} d t$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{2}{3 e^{4 t}} d t & =\int \frac{2}{3} e^{-4 t} d t \\
& =\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) e^{-4 t}+c \\
& =-\frac{1}{6} e^{-4 t}+c=-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{6} \boldsymbol{e}^{\mathbf{4 t}}}+\boldsymbol{c}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. Determine $\int \frac{3}{5 x} d x$
From 5 of Table 35.1,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{3}{5 x} d x & =\int\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) d x \\
& =\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{5}} \ln \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 16. Determine $\int\left(\frac{2 x^{2}+1}{x}\right) d x$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int\left(\frac{2 x^{2}+1}{x}\right) d x & =\int\left(\frac{2 x^{2}}{x}+\frac{1}{x}\right) d x \\

\end{aligned}=\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+\ln x+c$$

\subsection*{35.4 Definite integrals}

Integrals containing an arbitrary constant $c$ in their results are called indefinite integrals since their precise value cannot be determined without further information.
Definite integrals are those in which limits are applied.
If an expression is written as $[x]_{a}^{b}, \quad b$ is called the upper limit and $a$ the lower limit. The operation of applying the limits is defined as $[x]_{a}^{b}=(b)-(a)$.

For example, the increase in the value of the integral $x^{2}$ as $x$ increases from 1 to 3 is written as $\int_{1}^{3} x^{2} d x$. Applying the limits gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^{3} x^{2} d x & =\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}+c\right]_{1}^{3}=\left(\frac{3^{3}}{3}+c\right)-\left(\frac{1^{3}}{3}+c\right) \\
& =(9+c)-\left(\frac{1}{3}+c\right)=\mathbf{8} \frac{\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that the $c$ term always cancels out when limits are applied and it need not be shown with definite integrals.

Problem 17. Evaluate $\int_{1}^{2} 3 x d x$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^{2} 3 x d x=\left[\frac{3 x^{2}}{2}\right]_{1}^{2} & =\left\{\frac{3}{2}(2)^{2}\right\}-\left\{\frac{3}{2}(1)^{2}\right\} \\
& =6-1 \frac{1}{2}=\mathbf{4} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 18. Evaluate $\int_{-2}^{3}\left(4-x^{2}\right) d x$
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{-2}^{3}\left(4-x^{2}\right) d x & =\left[4 x-\frac{x^{3}}{3}\right]_{-2}^{3} \\
& =\left\{4(3)-\frac{(3)^{3}}{3}\right\}-\left\{4(-2)-\frac{(-2)^{3}}{3}\right\} \\
& =\{12-9\}-\left\{-8-\frac{-8}{3}\right\} \\
& =\{3\}-\left\{-5 \frac{1}{3}\right\}=\mathbf{8} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 19. Evaluate $\int_{0}^{2} x(3+2 x) d x$
$$\begin{aligned}

$$\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}$$

Problem 21. Evaluate $\int_{1}^{2}\left(\frac{1}{x^{2}}+\frac{2}{x}\right) d x$ correct to 3 decimal places

Problem 23. Evaluate $\int_{1}^{2} 4 \cos 3 t d t$
$$\begin{aligned}

& =\left\{\frac{4}{3} \sin 6\right\}-\left\{\frac{4}{3} \sin 3\right\}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that limits of trigonometric functions are always expressed in radians - thus, for example, sin 6 means the sine of 6 radians $=-0.279415 \ldots$ Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^{2} 4 \cos 3 t d t & =\left\{\frac{4}{3}(-0.279415 \ldots)\right\}-\left\{\frac{4}{3}(0.141120 \ldots)\right\} \\

\subsection*{35.5 The area under a curve}

The area shown shaded in Figure 35.1 may be determined using approximate methods such as the trapezoidal rule, the mid-ordinate rule or Simpson's rule (see Chapter 28) or, more precisely, by using integration.

Figure 35.1

The shaded area in Figure 35.1 is given by
$$\text { shaded area }=\int_{a}^{b} y d x=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x$$

Thus, determining the area under a curve by integration merely involves evaluating a definite integral, as shown in Section 35.4.
There are several instances in engineering and science where the area beneath a curve needs to be accurately determined. For example, the areas between the limits of a
velocity/time graph gives distance travelled, force/distance graph gives work done, voltage/current graph gives power, and so on.

Should a curve drop below the $x$-axis then $y(=f(x))$ becomes negative and $\int f(x) d x$ is negative. When determining such areas by integration, a negative sign is placed before the integral. For the curve shown in Figure 35.2, the total shaded area is given by (area $E+$ area $F+\operatorname{area} G$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-344.jpg?height=343&width=742&top_left_y=1323&top_left_x=258)

Figure 35.2

By integration,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { total shaded area }=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x-\int_{b}^{c} f(x) d x & \\
& +\int_{c}^{d} f(x) d x
\end{aligned}$$
(Note that this is not the same as $\int_{a}^{d} f(x) d x$ )
It is usually necessary to sketch a curve in order to check whether it crosses the $x$-axis.

Problem 26. Determine the area enclosed by $y=2 x+3$, the $x$-axis and ordinates $x=1$ and $x=4$
$y=2 x+3$ is a straight line graph as shown in Figure 35.3, in which the required area is shown shaded.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-344.jpg?height=603&width=606&top_left_y=444&top_left_x=1167)

Figure 35.3

By integration,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { shaded area } & =\int_{1}^{4} y d x=\int_{1}^{4}(2 x+3) d x=\left[\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+3 x\right]_{1}^{4} \\
& =[(16+12)-(1+3)]=\mathbf{2 4} \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$
(This answer may be checked since the shaded area is a trapezium: area of trapezium $=\frac{1}{2}$ (sum of parallel sides)(perpendicular distance between parallel sides) $=\frac{1}{2}(5+11)(3)=\mathbf{2 4}$ square units. $)$

Problem 27. The velocity $v$ of a body $t$ seconds after a certain instant is given by $v=\left(2 t^{2}+5\right) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. Find by integration how far it moves in the interval from $t=0$ to $t=4 \mathrm{~s}$

Since $2 t^{2}+5$ is a quadratic expression, the curve $v=2 t^{2}+5$ is a parabola cutting the $v$-axis at $v=5$, as shown in Figure 35.4.
The distance travelled is given by the area under the $v / t$ curve (shown shaded in Figure 35.4). By integration,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { shaded area } & =\int_{0}^{4} v d t=\int_{0}^{4}\left(2 t^{2}+5\right) d t=\left[\frac{2 t^{3}}{3}+5 t\right]_{0}^{4} \\
& =\left(\frac{2\left(4^{3}\right)}{3}+5(4)\right)-(0)
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. distance travelled $\mathbf{=} \mathbf{6 2 . 6 7} \mathbf{~ m}$

\section*{Problem 28. Sketch the graph} $y=x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x-6$ between $x=-3$ and $x=2$ and determine the area enclosed by the curve and the $x$-axis

A table of values is produced and the graph sketched as shown in Figure 35.5, in which the area enclosed by the curve and the $x$-axis is shown shaded.
\begin{tabular}{|rrr|rrrr|}
\hline$x$ & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\

Figure 35.5

Shaded area $=\int_{-3}^{-1} y d x-\int_{-1}^{2} y d x$, the minus sign before the second integral being necessary since the enclosed area is below the $x$-axis. Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { shaded area }=\int_{-3}^{-1}\left(x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x-6\right) d x \\
& -\quad-\int_{-1}^{2}\left(x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x-6\right) d x \\
& -\left[\frac{x^{4}}{4}+\frac{2 x^{3}}{3}-\frac{5 x^{2}}{2}-6 x\right]_{-3}^{-1} \\
& \begin{aligned}
= & {\left.\left[\left\{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{2 x^{3}}{3}-\frac{5 x^{2}}{2}-6 x\right]_{-1}^{2}+6\right\}-\left\{\frac{81}{4}-18-\frac{45}{2}+18\right\}\right] } \\
& -\left[\left\{4+\frac{16}{3}-10-12\right\}-\left\{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{2}{3}-\frac{5}{2}+6\right\}\right] \\
= & {\left[\left\{3 \frac{1}{12}\right\}-\left\{-2 \frac{1}{4}\right\}\right]-\left[\left\{-12 \frac{2}{3}\right\}-\left\{3 \frac{1}{12}\right\}\right] } \\
= & {\left[5 \frac{1}{3}\right]-\left[-15 \frac{3}{4}\right] }
\end{aligned} \\
& =\mathbf{2 1} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1 2}} \text { or 21.08 square units }
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 29. Determine the area enclosed by the curve $y=3 x^{2}+4$, the $x$-axis and ordinates $x=1$ and $x=4$ by (a) the trapezoidal rule, (b) the mid-ordinate rule, (c) Simpson's rule and (d) integration.

The curve $y=3 x^{2}+4$ is shown plotted in Figure 35.6. The trapezoidal rule, the mid-ordinate rule and Simpson's rule are discussed in Chapter 28, page 257.
(a) By the trapezoidal rule
$$\text { area }=\binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\left[\frac{1}{2}\binom{\text { first }+ \text { last }}{\text { ordinate }}\right.$$
$$\left.+\begin{array}{c}
\text { sum of } \\
+ \\
\text { remaining } \\
\text { ordinates }
\end{array}\right]$$
\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc|}
$x$ & 0 & 1.0 & 1.5 & 2.0 & 2.5 & 3.0 & 3.5 & 4.0 \\
$y$ & 4 & 7 & 10.75 & 16 & 22.75 & 31 & 40.75 & 52
\end{tabular}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-346.jpg?height=736&width=698&top_left_y=440&top_left_x=242)

Figure 35.6

Selecting 6 intervals each of width 0.5 gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { area }=(0.5)[ & \frac{1}{2}(7+52)+10.75+16 \\
& +22.75+31+40.75] \\
=\mathbf{7 5 . 3 7 5} & \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$
(b) By the mid-ordinate rule
area $=($ width of interval) (sum of mid-ordinates)
Selecting 6 intervals, each of width 0.5 , gives the mid-ordinates as shown by the broken lines in Figure 35.6. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { area }= & (0.5)(8.7+13.2+19.2+26.7 \\
& +35.7+46.2) \\
= & \mathbf{7 4 . 8 5} \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$
(c) By Simpson's rule
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { area }= & \frac{1}{3}\binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\left[\binom{\text { first }+ \text { last }}{\text { ordinates }}\right. \\
& +4\binom{\text { sum of even }}{\text { ordinates }} \\
& \left.+2\binom{\text { sum of remaining }}{\text { odd ordinates }}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

Selecting 6 intervals, each of width 0.5 , gives
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { area }= & \frac{1}{3}(0.5)[(7+52)+4(10.75+22.75 \\
& +40.75)+2(16+31)] \\
= & 75 \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$
(d) By integration
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { shaded area } & =\int_{1}^{4} y d x \\
& =\int_{1}^{4}\left(3 x^{2}+4\right) d x=\left[x^{3}+4 x\right]_{1}^{4} \\
& =(64+16)-(1+4) \\
& =\mathbf{7 5} \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$

Integration gives the precise value for the area under a curve. In this case, Simpson's rule is seen to be the most accurate of the three approximate methods.

Problem 30. Find the area enclosed by the curve $y=\sin 2 x$, the $x$-axis and the ordinates $x=0$ and $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$

A sketch of $y=\sin 2 x$ is shown in Figure 35.7. (Note that $y=\sin 2 x$ has a period of $\frac{2 \pi}{2}$ i.e., $\pi$ radians.)

Figure 35.7
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Shaded area } & =\int_{0}^{\pi / 3} y d x \\
& =\int_{0}^{\pi / 3} \sin 2 x d x=\left[-\frac{1}{2} \cos 2 x\right]_{0}^{\pi / 3} \\
& =\left\{-\frac{1}{2} \cos \frac{2 \pi}{3}\right\}-\left\{-\frac{1}{2} \cos 0\right\} \\
& =\left\{-\frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right\}-\left\{-\frac{1}{2}(1)\right\} \\
& =\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\mathbf{3}}{\mathbf{4}} \text { or } \mathbf{0 . 7 5} \text { square units }
\end{aligned}$$

Sum of $n$ terms, $S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}[2 a+(n-1) d]$

\section*{Geometric progression:}

If $a=$ first term and $r=$ common ratio, then the geometric progression is: $a, a r, a r^{2}, \ldots$
The $n$ 'th term is: $a r^{n-1}$
Sum of $n$ terms, $S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{(1-r)}$ or $\frac{a\left(r^{n}-1\right)}{(r-1)}$
If $-1<r<1, \quad S_{\infty}=\frac{a}{(1-r)}$

\section*{Statistics:}

Discrete data:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { mean, } \bar{x} & =\frac{\sum x}{n} \\
\text { standard deviation, } \sigma & =\sqrt{\left[\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}\right]}
\end{aligned}$$

Grouped data:
mean, $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum f x}{\sum f}$
standard deviation, $\sigma=\sqrt{\left[\frac{\sum\left\{f(x-\bar{x})^{2}\right\}}{\sum f}\right]}$

\section*{Standard derivatives}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline $\boldsymbol{y}$ or $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})$ & $\frac{\boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{y}}{\boldsymbol{d} \boldsymbol{x}}=$ or $\boldsymbol{f}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{x})$ \\
\hline$a x^{n}$ & $a n x^{n-1}$ \\
$\sin a x$ & $a \cos a x$ \\
$\cos a x$ & $-a \sin a x$ \\
$e^{a x}$ & $a e^{a x}$ \\
$\ln a x$ & $\frac{1}{x}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
