                        <p>A set is a group of data and an individual value within the set is called a member of the set. Thus, if the masses of five people are measured correct to the nearest 0.1 kilogram and are found to be 53.1 kg, 59.4 kg, 62.1 kg, 77.8 kg and 64.4 kg then the set of masses in kilograms for these five people is $\{53.1, 59.4, 62.1, 77.8, 64.4\}$ and one of the members of the set is 59.4</p>
                        <p>A set containing all the members is called a population. Some members selected at random from a population are called a sample. Thus, all car registration numbers form a population but the registration numbers of, say, 20 cars taken at random throughout the country are a sample drawn from that population.</p>
                        <p>The number of times that the value of a member occurs in a set is called the frequency of that member. Thus, in the set $\{2,3,4,5,4,2,4,7,9\}$, member 4 has a frequency of three, member 2 has a frequency of 2 and the other members have a frequency of one.</p>
                        <p>The relative frequency with which any member of a set occurs is given by the ratio $\frac{\text{frequency of member}}{\text{total frequency of all members}}$</p>
                        <p>For the set $\{2,3,5,4,7,5,6,2,8\}$, the relative frequency of member 5 is $\frac{2}{9}$. Often, relative frequency is expressed as a percentage and the percentage relative frequency is (relative frequency $\times 100)\%$</p>

                        <p>Trends in ungrouped data over equal periods of time can be presented diagrammatically by a percentage component bar chart.

                        <p>A pie diagram is used to show diagrammatically the parts making up the whole. In a pie diagram, the area of a circle represents the whole and the areas of the sectors of the circle are made proportional to the parts which make up the whole (see Problem 6).</p>

                        <p>When the number of members in a set is small, say ten or less, the data can be represented diagrammatically without further analysis, by means of pictograms, bar charts, percentage components bar charts or pie diagrams (as shown in Section 31.2).</p>
                        <p>For sets having more than ten members, those members having similar values are grouped together in classes to form a frequency distribution. To assist in accurately counting members in the various classes, a tally diagram is used (see Problems 8 and 12).</p>
                        <p>A frequency distribution is merely a table showing classes and their corresponding frequencies (see Problems 8 and 12). The new set of values obtained by forming a frequency distribution is called grouped data. The terms used in connection with grouped data are shown in Figure 31.6(a). The size or range of a class is given by the upper class boundary value minus the lower class boundary value and in Figure 31.6(b) is 7.65-7.35; i.e., 0.30 . The class interval for the class shown in Figure 31.6(b) is 7.4 to 7.6 and the class mid-point value is given by</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{(\text{upper class boundary value})+(\text{lower class boundary value})}{2}$$</div>
                        <p>and in Figure 31.6(b) is $\frac{7.65+7.35}{2}$ i.e. 7.5</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_6087c43bc92deffd8bd0g-306.jpg" alt="Class terminology and example" class="content-image">
                        <p>Figure 31.6</p>
                        <p>One of the principal ways of presenting grouped data diagrammatically is to use a histogram, in which the areas of vertical, adjacent rectangles are made proportional to frequencies of the classes (see Problem 9). When class intervals are equal, the heights of the rectangles of a histogram are equal to the frequencies of the classes. For histograms having unequal class intervals, the area must be proportional to the frequency. Hence, if the class interval of class A is twice the class interval of class B, then for equal frequencies the height of the rectangle representing A is half that of B (see Problem 11).</p>
                        <p>Another method of presenting grouped data diagrammatically is to use a frequency polygon, which is the graph produced by plotting frequency against class midpoint values and joining the co-ordinates with straight lines (see Problem 12).</p>
                        <p>A cumulative frequency distribution is a table showing the cumulative frequency for each value of upper class boundary. The cumulative frequency for a particular value of upper class boundary is obtained by adding the frequency of the class to the sum of the previous frequencies. A cumulative frequency distribution is formed in Problem 13.</p>
                        <p>The curve obtained by joining the co-ordinates of cumulative frequency (vertically) against upper class boundary (horizontally) is called an ogive or a cumulative frequency distribution curve (see Problem 13).</p>

                                <p>The range of the data is the value obtained by taking the value of the smallest member from that of the largest member. Inspection of the set of data shows that range = 89 - 71 = 18. The size of each class is given approximately by the range divided by the number of classes. Since 7 classes are required, the size of each class is $18 \div 7$; that is, approximately 3. To achieve seven equal classes spanning a range of values from 71 to 89, the class intervals are selected as 70-72, 73-75, and so on.</p>
                                <p>To assist with accurately determining the number in each class, a tally diagram is produced, as shown in Table 31.1(a). This is obtained by listing the classes in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the 40 members of the set in turn and allocating them to the appropriate classes by putting '1's in the appropriate rows. Every fifth '1' allocated to a particular row is shown as an oblique line crossing the four previous '1's, to help with final counting.</p>

                                <p>A cumulative frequency distribution is a table giving values of cumulative frequency for the values of upper class boundaries and is shown in Table 31.6. Columns 1 and 2 show the classes and their frequencies. Column 3 lists the upper class boundary values for the classes given in column 1. Column 4 gives the cumulative frequency values for all frequencies less than the upper class boundary values given in column 3. Thus, for example, for the 7.7 to 7.9 class shown in row 3, the cumulative frequency value is the sum of all frequencies having values of less than 7.95 , i.e. $3+5+9=17$, and so on.</p>
