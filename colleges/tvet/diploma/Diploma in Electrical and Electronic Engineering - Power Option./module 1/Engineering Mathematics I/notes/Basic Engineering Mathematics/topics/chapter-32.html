                        <h3 class="subsubsection-heading">32.2.1 Mean</h3>
                        <p>The arithmetic mean value is found by adding together the values of the members of a set and dividing by the number of members in the set. Thus, the mean of the set of numbers $\{4,5,6,9\}$ is</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{4+5+6+9}{4} \text{ i.e. } 6$$</div>
                        <p>In general, the mean of the set $\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots x_{n}\}$ is</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n} \text{ written as } \frac{\sum x}{n}$$</div>
                        <p>where $\sum$ is the Greek letter 'sigma' and means 'the sum of ' and $\bar{x}$ (called $x$-bar) is used to signify a mean value.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsubsection-heading">32.2.2 Median</h3>
                        <p>The median value often gives a better indication of the general size of a set containing extreme values. The set $\{7,5,74,10\}$ has a mean value of 24, which is not really representative of any of the values of the members of the set. The median value is obtained by</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(a)</span> <span class="item-text">ranking the set in ascending order of magnitude, and</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(b)</span> <span class="item-text">selecting the value of the middle member for sets containing an odd number of members or finding the value of the mean of the two middle members for sets containing an even number of members.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, the set $\{7,5,74,10\}$ is ranked as $\{5,7,10,74\}$ and, since it contains an even number of members (four in this case), the mean of 7 and 10 is taken, giving a median value of 8.5 . Similarly, the set $\{3,81,15,7,14\}$ is ranked as $\{3,7,14,15,81\}$ and the median value is the value of the middle member, i.e. 14 .</p>

                        <h3 class="subsubsection-heading">32.2.3 Mode</h3>
                        <p>The modal value, or mode, is the most commonly occurring value in a set. If two values occur with the same frequency, the set is 'bi-modal'. The set $\{5,6,8,2,5,4,6,5,3\}$ has a modal value of 5, since the member having a value of 5 occurs the most, i.e. three times.</p>

                                <p>To obtain the median value the set is ranked, that is, placed in ascending order of magnitude, and since the set contains an odd number of members the value of the middle member is the median value.

                        <p>The mean, median and modal values for grouped data may be determined from a histogram. In a histogram, frequency values are represented vertically and variable values horizontally. The mean value is given by the value of the variable corresponding to a vertical line drawn through the centroid of the histogram. The median value is obtained by selecting a variable value such that the area of the histogram to the left of a vertical line drawn through the selected variable value is equal to the area of the histogram on the right of the line. The modal value is the variable value obtained by dividing the width of the highest rectangle in the histogram in proportion to the heights of the adjacent rectangles. The method of determining the mean, median and modal values from a histogram is shown in Problem 4.</p>

                                <div class="equation">
                                     $$\begin{aligned} 100 M=(10 \times 1)+(16 \times 3)+(32 \times 5)&+(24 \times 7) \\ &+(12 \times 9)+(6 \times 11) \end{aligned}$$
                                 </div>
                                <p>i.e. $M=\frac{560}{100}=5.6$ units from YY</p>
                                <p>Thus, the position of the mean with reference to the time scale is $14+5.6$, i.e. <strong>19.6 minutes</strong>.</p>
                                <p>The median is the value of time corresponding to a vertical line dividing the total area of the histogram into two equal parts. The total area is 100 square units, hence the vertical line must be drawn to give 50 units of area on each side. To achieve this with reference to Figure 32.1, rectangle ABFE must be split so that $50-(10+16)$ units of area lie on one side and $50-(24+12+6)$ units of area lie on the other. This shows that the area of ABFE is split so that 24 units of area lie to the left of the line and 8 units of area lie to the right; i.e., the vertical line must pass through 19.5 minutes. Thus, the median value of the distribution is <strong>19.5 minutes</strong>.</p>
                                <p>The mode is obtained by dividing the line AB, which is the height of the highest rectangle, proportionally to the heights of the adjacent rectangles. With reference to Figure 32.1, this is achieved by joining AC and BD and drawing a vertical line through the point of intersection of these two lines. This gives the mode of the distribution, which is <strong>19.3 minutes</strong>.</p>

The set $\{5,6,7,8,9\}$ also has a mean value of 7 but the standard deviation is about 1.4. This shows that the members of the second set are mainly much closer to the mean value than the members of the first set.

                        <p>Other measures of dispersion which are sometimes used are the quartile, decile and percentile values. The quartile values of a set of discrete data are obtained by selecting the values of members which divide the set into four equal parts. Thus, for the set $\{2,3,4,5,5,7, 9,11,13,14,17\}$ there are 11 members and the values of the members dividing the set into four equal parts are 4,7 and 13. These values are signified by $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ and called the first, second and third quartile values, respectively. It can be seen that the second quartile value, $Q_{2}$, is the value of the middle member and hence is the median value of the set.</p>
                        <p>For grouped data the ogive may be used to determine the quartile values. In this case, points are selected on the vertical cumulative frequency values of the ogive, such that they divide the total value of cumulative frequency into four equal parts. Horizontal lines are drawn from these values to cut the ogive. The values of the variable corresponding to these cutting points on the ogive give the quartile values (see Problem 7).</p>
                        <p>When a set contains a large number of members, the set can be split into ten parts, each containing an equal number of members. These ten parts are then called deciles. For sets containing a very large number of members, the set may be split into one hundred parts, each containing an equal number of members. One of these parts is called a percentile.</p>

                                <p>The ogive is formed by plotting these values on a graph, as shown in Figure 32.2. The total frequency is divided into four equal parts, each having a range of $48 \div 4$, i.e. 12. This gives cumulative frequency values of 0 to 12 corresponding to the first quartile, 12 to 24 corresponding to the second quartile, 24 to 36 corresponding to the third quartile and 36 to 48 corresponding to the fourth quartile of the distribution; i.e., the distribution is divided into four equal parts. The quartile values are those of the variable corresponding to cumulative frequency values of 12, 24 and 36, marked $Q_{1}, Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ in Figure 32.2. These values, correct to the nearest hour, are <strong>37 hours, 43 hours</strong> and <strong>48 hours</strong>, respectively. The $Q_{2}$ value is also equal to the median value of the distribution. One measure of the dispersion of a distribution is called the semi-interquartile range and is given by $(Q_{3}-Q_{1}) \div 2$ and is $(48-37) \div 2$ in this case; i.e., $\mathbf{5}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}$ hours.</p>
