Candidates should answer the questions in English.
1. (a) Given that $y=e^{3 x}$. Find $\frac{d y}{d x}$ from first principles.

(6 marks)
4. (a) Given that $z_{1}=2-3 j, z_{2}=3+4 j$ and $z_{3}=4+j$ express Z in the form $a+j b$ if $\frac{1}{z}=\frac{1}{z_{1}}+\frac{1}{z_{2}}+\frac{1}{z_{3}}$ correct to 3 decimal places.
