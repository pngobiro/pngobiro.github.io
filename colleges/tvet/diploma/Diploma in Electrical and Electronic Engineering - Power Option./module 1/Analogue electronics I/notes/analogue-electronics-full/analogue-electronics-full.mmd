\title{
CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS, GASES, AND VACUUM
}

\section*{CONDUCTION IN SOLIDS}
- All substances are made up of atoms, which have charged particles called electrons and protons.
- Electricity in all forms is due to the charges on these particles.
- When charged particles move in an orderly fashion, we get an electric current.

\section*{Conduction in solids}
- Among solids, metals are good conductors of electricity.
- In metals, some electrons are not very tightly bound to the atoms.
- They move about randomly in different directions within the metal.
- When a voltage is applied across a piece of metal, these electrons move in an orderly fashion in one direction.
- This flow of electrons is the current in the metal.

\section*{Electric Current(Amperes)}
- Electric Current characterizes the motion of electrically charged particles within conductors.
- An electric current may cause heating of matter, electrochemical processes, and magnetization.
- Definition of the direction of the current corresponds to the direction of motion of positive charges.

\section*{Direct current}
- When the current direction and intensity are constant in time, the current is known as direct current (dc).
Alternating Current
- When the current direction and intensity of the current change periodically with time, the current is known as the alternating current (ac).

\section*{Electric resistance and conductance}
- The resistance $R$ is the ratio of voltage $V$ to current I :
$$R=\frac{V}{I}$$
- Conductance, $\sigma$, reciprocal value of the electric resistance, the quotient of current I, and voltage V .
$$\text { conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { resistance }}=\frac{\text { Current }}{\text { Voltage }}$$

\section*{Resistivity and conductivity}
- Resistivity, $\rho$ (specific resistance), is a material-dependent quantity independent of the conductor's geometry. Ohm•meter, is the SI unit of the specific resistance $\rho$.
- Conductivity, $\kappa$ (specific conductance), is the reciprocal value of the specific resistance. Siemens/meter, $\mathbf{S} / \mathbf{m}$, is the SI unit of the conductivity $\kappa$.

\section*{Resistance of a wire}

Resistance $=$ specific resistance $\cdot \frac{\text { length }}{\text { Area }}=\mathrm{r} \cdot \frac{l}{A}$

\section*{Temperature dependence of the resistance}
- The resistivity $\rho$, and hence the electric resistance R , of a conductor, are temperature-dependent.

\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Voltage divider}
- A voltage divider is a simple series resistor circuit
- Its output voltage is a fixed fraction of its input voltage.
- Two resistors determine the divide-down ratio.

Input voltage $\mathrm{V}_{\text {in }}$ is applied to the top and bottom of the series resistors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-016.jpg?height=731&width=1092&top_left_y=911&top_left_x=731)

\section*{Current divider circuit}
- Current Divider circuits have two or more parallel branches for currents to flow through, but the voltage is the same for all components in the parallel circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-017.jpg?height=663&width=955&top_left_y=819&top_left_x=431)

\section*{Capacitors}
- Capacitors and batteries both store electrical energy.
- A capacitor is much simpler than a battery, as it can't produce new electrons -it only stores them.
- Inside the capacitor, the terminals connect to two metal plates separated by a nonconducting substance, or dielectric.

\section*{Capacitor Circuit}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-019.jpg?height=1273&width=1475&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=676)

\section*{Uses of capacitors:}
- Store charge for high-speed use. Big lasers use this technique as well to get very bright, instantaneous flashes.
- Capacitors can also eliminate ripples
- A capacitor can block DC voltage. If you connect a capacitor to a battery, then no current will flow between the battery poles once the capacitor charges.
- However, an alternating current (AC) signal flows through a capacitor unimpeded. That's because the capacitor will charge and discharge as the alternating current fluctuates, making it appear that the alternating current is flowing.

\section*{CONDUCTION IN GASES}

\section*{Current conduction in gases}
- A rarefied neutral gas does not conduct current as an ideal vacuum does.
- The rarefied gas can conduct only by the input of charge carriers.
- Gas discharge is current conduction in gases mainly at low pressure.

\section*{Non-self-sustained discharge}
- a gaseous discharge where some external influence is needed to ionise the gas in order to get current to flow. eg from electron gun, X-ray, UV, Cosmic Radiation, etc

\section*{Current-voltage characteristic of a gas (non-sustained discharge)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-024.jpg?height=857&width=1435&top_left_y=536&top_left_x=682)

I: recombination range
II: saturation range
III: proportional range

\section*{Current-voltage characteristic of a gas (non-sustained discharge)}
- Recombination range: the range of voltage in which the current increases proportionally with the voltage applied. Ohm's law is valid in the form:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{Current in the recombination range} \\
\hline \multirow{2}{*}{$I=\mathrm{g} \frac{A}{d} V$} & Symbol & Unit & Quantity \\

V
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}

voltage
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Current-voltage characteristic of a gas (non-sustained discharge)}
- Saturation range: range of voltage in which nearly all ions reach the electrode. The current I is nearly independent of the voltage V.
- Proportional range: the range of voltage in which the ions' and electrons' energy is sufficiently high to ionize neutral atoms and molecules. The ionization current I increases linearly with the voltage $V$.

\section*{Self-sustained gaseous discharge}
- In a self sustained discharge the potential gradient is sufficiently high that free electrons are accelerated hard enough to ionise atoms they collide with.
- This means that as the current flows it keeps a population of ions and free electrons present.

\section*{Types of Self-sustained gaseous discharge}
- Glow discharge: A luminous discharge at mean current densities of $10^{-9} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{m}^{2}<\mathrm{J}<10^{-4} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
- The ions striking the cathode liberate electrons, which flow towards the anode.
- Owing to the different mobility of the positive and negative charge carriers, zones of different space charges build up in the region between the electrodes.
- Therefore, the gas between the cathode and anode does not glow uniformly.
Application: Fluorescent lamps

\section*{Self-sustained gaseous discharge}
- Arc Discharge:bright luminous discharge at current densities $\mathrm{J}>10^{-4} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
- The cathode is heated by the incident current and emits more electrons by thermo-ionic emission or field emission.

Applications: Mercury-vapor lamp

\section*{Self-sustained gaseous discharge}

\section*{Dark Discharge}
- This is a self-terminating arc discharge.
- It is a gaseous discharge at very low current densities and low discharge voltages insufficient to ignite a self-sustained discharge.
- Mainly it may be sustained only by external ionization due to an external source of radiation.
- The dark discharge's ignition voltage depends on the electrodes' shape and distance and the gas pressure between the electrodes.

\section*{Current-voltage characteristic of a gaseous discharge (self-sustained)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-031.jpg?height=653&width=1211&top_left_y=424&top_left_x=685)

Vz : ignition voltage. I: dark discharge, II: glow discharge, III: arc discharge.

\section*{Current-voltage characteristic of a gaseous discharge (self-sustained)}
- Ignition voltage is the voltage at which a dark discharge turns into a glow discharge.
- Self-sustained gaseous discharges have decreasing resistance characteristics or even a negative differential resistance dV/dI
- A dropping resistor (current limiter) is used to prevent self-sustained gaseous discharges- an induction coil may be used for alternating current.

\section*{CONDUCTION IN VACUUM}

\section*{Vacuum Tubes}
- These are evacuated glass bulbs with inserted electrodes that control the flow of electrons by their electric potentials.
Cathode and anode in vacuum tubes
- The cathode is the negative electrode in the tube that releases electrons by thermo-ionic emission. It is heated either directly or indirectly.
- The anode is the positive electrode opposed to the cathode.

\section*{Vacuum Tubes}
- Vacuum tubes are evacuated to reduce as far as possible the collisions of electrons with gas molecules and to prevent oxidation of the hot cathode.
- Anode potential, Va, is the voltage between anode and cathode.
- Anode current, Ia, is the current between anode and cathode.

\section*{Vacuum Tubes}

\section*{Plate resistance and characteristics}
- Plate resistance, Ri , is the internal electric resistance of a vacuum tube.
- By analogy to ohmic resistance, one defines:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{Plate resistance} \\
\hline \multirow{2}{*}{$R_{i}=\frac{V_{a}}{I_{a}}$} & Symbol & Unit & Quantity \\

\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Vacuum tubes are being replaced by semiconductor components.
- Unlike semiconductors, tubes are relatively insensitive to overvoltages and particle radiation.

\section*{Vacuum Tubes}

\section*{Application}
- special tubes (television tubes, x-ray tubes)
- tubes for high electric and mechanical loads
- tubes for high power like transmitting vacuum tubes.

- Residual current is the current flowing in a vacuum-tube diode without an applied external voltage.
- The electrons released by heating of the cathode provide a current between the cathode and anode even without an external voltage.
- The current stops only when a sufficiently high counter-voltage is applied at the anode.

\section*{Vacuum Tube Devices}

\section*{Vacuum-tube triode}
- Used for voltage amplification.
- The vacuum tube triode contains a grid between anode and cathode
- The anode current's magnitude may be controlled by applying a potential difference between grid and cathode
- The grid remains almost free of current; hence the current control works without power consumption.
- The triode amplifies the voltage signal applied to the grid.

- Electronic devices are fabricated by using semiconductor materials along with conductors and insulators.
- To better understand the behavior of electronic devices in circuits, we must first understand a few of the characteristics of the semiconductor material.
- Silicon is by far the most common semiconductor material used for semiconductor devices and integrated circuits.

\section*{Intrinsic Semiconductors}
- An atom comprises a nucleus, containing positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons that orbit the nucleus.
- The electrons are distributed in various "shells" at different distances from the nucleus, and electron energy increases as the shell radius increases.
- Electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons, and the chemical activity of a material is determined primarily by the number of such electrons.
- Elements in the periodic table can be grouped according to the number of valence electrons.

- Silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) are in group IV and are elemental semiconductors.
- In contrast, gallium arsenide is a group III$\mathbf{V}$ compound semiconductor.
- The elements in group III and group V are also important in semiconductors.

- At T $=0 \mathrm{~K}$, silicon is an insulator; no charge flows through it.
- When silicon atoms come together to form a crystal, the electrons occupy particular allowed energy bands.
- At T $=0 \mathrm{~K}$, all valence electrons occupy the valence energy band
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-050.jpg?height=650&width=910&top_left_y=1204&top_left_x=990)
- If the temperature increases, the valence electrons may gain thermal energy.
- Any such electron may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond and move away from its original position.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-051.jpg?height=730&width=976&top_left_y=996&top_left_x=954)
- To break the covalent bond, the valence electron must gain minimum energy, Eg, called the bandgap energy.
- The electrons that gain this minimum energy now exist in the conduction band and are said to be free electrons.
- These free electrons in the conduction band can move throughout the crystal. The net flow of electrons in the conduction band generates a current.
- As the temperature increases, more covalent bonds are broken, and more free electrons and positive empty states are created.
- A valence electron with a certain thermal energy and is adjacent to an empty state may move into that position, making it appear as if a positive charge is moving through the semiconductor.
- This positively charged "particle" is called a hole.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-053.jpg?height=958&width=1190&top_left_y=819&top_left_x=878)
- Then, in semiconductors, two types of charged particles contribute to the current: the negatively charged free electron and the positively charged hole.
- An intrinsic semiconductor is a single-crystal semiconductor material with no other types of atoms within the crystal.
- In an intrinsic semiconductor, the densities of electrons and holes are equal since the thermally generated electrons and holes are the only sources of such particles.

\section*{Extrinsic Semiconductors}
- Since the electron and hole concentrations in an intrinsic semiconductor are relatively small, only minimal currents are possible.
- However, these concentrations can be significantly increased by adding controlled amounts of certain impurities.
- A desirable impurity enters the crystal lattice and replaces (i.e., substitutes for) one of the semiconductor atoms, even though the impurity atom does not have the same valence electron structure.
- For silicon, the desirable substitutional impurities are from the group III and V elements.
- The most common group V elements used for this purpose are phosphorus and arsenic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-058.jpg?height=1021&width=1208&top_left_y=654&top_left_x=848)
- For phosphorous, four valence electrons are used to satisfy the covalent bond requirements.
- The fifth valence electron is more loosely bound to the phosphorus atom.
- At room temperature, this electron has enough thermal energy to break the bond, thus being free to move through the crystal and contribute to the electron current in the semiconductor.
- When the fifth phosphorus valence electron moves into the conduction band, a positively charged phosphorus ion is created
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-060.jpg?height=776&width=958&top_left_y=594&top_left_x=966)
- The phosphorus atom is called a donor impurity since it donates an electron that is free to move.
- Although the remaining phosphorus atom has a net positive charge, it is immobile in the crystal and cannot contribute to the current.
- Therefore, when a donor impurity is added to a semiconductor, free electrons are created without generating holes.

\section*{Doping}
- This process is called doping, and it allows us to control the concentration of free electrons in a semiconductor.
- A semiconductor that contains donor impurity atoms is called an n-type semiconductor (for the negatively charged electrons) and has a preponderance of electrons compared to holes.
- The most common group III element used for silicon doping is boron.
- When a boron atom replaces a silicon atom, its three valence electrons are used to satisfy the covalent bond requirements for three of the four nearest silicon atoms.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-063.jpg?height=832&width=994&top_left_y=1015&top_left_x=906)
- This leaves one bond position open.
- At room temperature, adjacent silicon valence electrons have sufficient thermal energy to move into this position, thereby creating a hole.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-064.jpg?height=790&width=948&top_left_y=931&top_left_x=996)
- Because the boron atom has accepted a valence electron, the boron is therefore called an acceptor impurity. Acceptor atoms lead to the creation of holes without electrons being generated.
- This process, also called doping, can control the concentration of holes in a semiconductor.
- A semiconductor that contains acceptor impurity atoms is called a p-type semiconductor (for the positively charged holes created) and has a majority of holes compared to electrons.
- The materials containing impurity atoms are called extrinsic semiconductors or doped semiconductors.
- The doping process, which allows us to control the concentrations of free electrons and holes, determines the material's conductivity and currents.

\section*{P-n Junction Diode}
- When p and n regions of semiconductor materials are adjacent to one another, they form a p-n Junction. The electronic device so formed is called a diode.
- A diode conducts current in one direction when it is operating in the forward-biased mode.
- forward-biased mode: the p-region is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage source; the n -region to the negative terminal of a voltage source.
- reverse biased mode: the p-region is connected to the negative terminal of a voltage source whereas the $\mathbf{n}$-region is connected to the positive terminal.
- For an ideal diode, the relationship between the current and voltage is given as:
$$i_{D}=I_{S}\left[e^{\left(\frac{\mathrm{v}_{D}}{n V_{T}}\right)}-1\right]$$
$I_{s}$ - reverse-bias saturation current $\left(10^{-18}-10^{-12} \mathrm{~A}\right)$
$\mathrm{v}_{T}$ - Thermal voltage ( 26 mV at room Temp)
$n$ - Ideality Factor (1£ $n £ 2$ )

Task (Modelling a non-ideal Diode in Matlab

\section*{Diode circuits: AC analysis and Models}
- Diodes are often used in linear amplifier circuits, where time-varying signals are used.
- In such applications, we need to model the diode behavior/characteristics because ac signals may be superimposed on the dc voltages and currents.
- The total source voltage $v_{1}$ is the sum of the dc voltage $V_{P S}$ and sinusoidal voltage $v_{i}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-074.jpg?height=671&width=1246&top_left_y=626&top_left_x=682)
- We can apply both dc analysis and ac analysis to this circuit.

\section*{Current-Voltage Relationships}
- Since the source voltage contains both dc and ac components superimposed, the diode voltage and current will also contain a dc and ac component superimposed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-075.jpg?height=541&width=997&top_left_y=1010&top_left_x=235)

\section*{Model Development}
- We can develop a linear model from a nonlinear diode by assuming that the ac signal is small compared to the dc component.
- The relationship between the diode current and diode voltage is (neglecting the -1 in the diode equation):

- If the ac signal is "small", then $v_{d}=V_{T}$ and we can expand the exponential function into a linear series, as follows:
$$e^{\left(\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}}\right)} \cong 1+\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}} \quad\left[\text { from }^{x}=1+\frac{x}{1!}+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\ldots\right]$$
- We may also write the quiescent diode current as:
$$I_{D Q}=I_{S} e^{\left(\frac{V_{D Q}}{V_{T}}\right)}$$
- The diode current-voltage relationship from can then be written as:
$$i_{D}=I_{D Q}\left(1+\frac{v_{d}}{V_{T}}\right)=I_{D Q}+\frac{I_{D Q}}{V_{T}} \cdot v_{d}=I_{D Q}+i_{d}$$

The diode ac current and voltage are related as:
$$i_{d}=\left(\frac{I_{D Q}}{V_{T}}\right) \cdot v_{d}=g_{d} \cdot v_{d}$$

The diode ac voltage is given by:
$$v_{d}=\left(\frac{V_{T}}{I_{D Q}}\right) \cdot i_{d}=r_{d} \cdot i_{d}$$

\section*{Diodes for Specialized application}

\section*{Solar Cell}
- A solar cell is a p-n junction device with no voltage directly applied across the junction.
- The p-n junction, which converts solar energy into electrical energy, is connected to a load.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-083.jpg?height=580&width=1050&top_left_y=1141&top_left_x=808)
- When light hits the space-charge region, electrons and holes are generated. They are quickly separated and swept out of the spacecharge region by the electric field, thus creating a photocurrent.
- The generated photocurrent will produce a voltage across the load, which means that the solar cell has supplied power.
- Solar cells are usually fabricated from silicon but may be made from GaAs or other III-V compound semiconductors.

\section*{Photodiode}
- Photodetectors are devices that convert optical signals into electrical signals. An example is a photodiode, which is similar to a solar cell except that the p-n junction is operated with a reverse-bias voltage.
- Incident photons or light waves create excess electrons and holes in the space-charge region. These excess carriers are quickly separated and swept out of the space-charge region by the electric field, thus creating a "photocurrent."
- This generated photocurrent is directly proportional to the incident photon flux.

\section*{Zener Diode}
- When a reverse-bias voltage is increasingly applied to a diode, at a certain voltage called the breakdown voltage, the junction breaks down and the reverse bias current increases rapidly.

\section*{Diode I-V characteristics showing breakdown effects}

\section*{Characteristics of Zener Diode}
- Zener diodes are designed and fabricated to provide a specified breakdown voltage $V_{Z_{0}}$
- A Zener diode can be used as a constantvoltage reference in a circuit.
- $r_{z}$ (Zener Resistance) in the reverse breakdown region is very small
- Circuit symbol:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-088.jpg?height=257&width=541&top_left_y=1443&top_left_x=1273)

\section*{Simple Zener Diode Circuit}

- If the current I is to be limited to 3 mA (and neglecting diode resistance)
$$\begin{aligned}
& I=\frac{V_{P S}-V_{Z}}{R} \\
& R=\frac{V_{P S}-V_{Z}}{I}=\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}-5.6 \mathrm{~V}}{3 m A}=1.47 \mathrm{~kW}
\end{aligned}$$
- Power dissipated in the Zener Diode:
$$P_{Z}=I_{Z} V_{Z}=3 m A^{\prime} 5.6 \mathrm{~V}=16.8 \mathrm{~mW}$$

\section*{Voltage regulator}
- Zener Diode circuits are used in power supplies to provide voltage regulation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-090.jpg?height=450&width=1067&top_left_y=676&top_left_x=880)
- A voltage regulator should:
1. Maintain a constant output voltage even if the load varies.
2. Maintain a constant output voltage even if the input voltage varies.

\section*{Voltage Regulator Design}
1. Determine the proper current limiting Resistor
$$R_{i}=\frac{V_{P S}-V_{Z}}{I_{1}}=\frac{V_{P S}-V_{Z}}{I_{Z}+I_{L}}$$
diode current $\quad I_{Z}=\frac{V_{P S}-V_{Z}}{R_{i}}-I_{L}$ and $I_{L}=V_{Z} / R_{L}$
- For proper operation of this circuit, the diode must remain in the breakdown region and the power dissipation in the diode must not exceed its rated value.

\section*{Design of Limiting Resistor}
- The current in the diode is a minimum, $I_{Z}(\min )$, when the load current is a maximum, $I_{L}$ (max), and the source voltage is a minimum, $V_{P S}(\min )$.
- The current in the diode is a maximum, $I_{Z}$ (max), when the load current is a minimum, $I_{L}(\min )$, and the source voltage is a maximum, $V_{P S}$ (max).
- Therefore:
$$R_{i}=\frac{V_{P S}(\min )-V_{Z}}{I_{Z}(\min )+I_{L}(\max )}$$

And
$$R_{i}=\frac{V_{P S}(\max )-V_{Z}}{I_{Z}(\max )+I_{L}(\min )}$$

\section*{Design of Limiting Resistor}
- Equating the two equations:
$$\begin{aligned}
& {\left[V_{P S}(\min )-V_{Z}\right] \cdot\left[I_{Z}(\max )+I_{L}(\min )\right]} \\
& =\left[V_{P S}(\max )-V_{Z}\right] \cdot\left[I_{Z}(\min )+I_{L}(\max )\right]
\end{aligned}$$
- We can assume that we know the range of input voltage, the range of output load current, and the Zener voltage.
- There are two unknowns, $I_{z}$ (min)and $I_{z}$ (max).
- As a minimum requirement, we can set the minimum Zener current to be one-tenth the maximum Zener current, or $I_{Z}(\mathrm{~min})=0.1 I_{Z}(\mathrm{max})$.

\section*{Design of Limiting Resistor}
$$I_{Z}(\max )=\frac{I_{L}(\max ) \cdot\left[V_{P S}(\max )-V_{Z}\right]-I_{L}(\min ) \cdot\left[V_{P S}(\min )-V_{Z}\right]}{V_{P S}(\min )-0.9 V_{Z}-0.1 V_{P S}(\max )}$$

\section*{$R_{i}$}
$$=\frac{V_{P S}(\max )-V_{Z}}{I_{Z}(\max )+I_{L}(\min )}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
& P_{Z}(\max )=I_{Z}(\max ) \cdot \mathrm{V}_{Z}=300 \times 9=2.7 \mathrm{~W} \\
& I_{Z}(\max )=\frac{100 \cdot[13.6-9]-0}{11-0.9(9)-0.1(13.6)} \cong 300 \mathrm{~mA} \\
& \quad R_{i}=\frac{13.6-9}{0.3+0}=15.3 \Omega \\
& P_{R_{i}}=\frac{\left(V_{P S(\max )}-V_{Z}\right)^{2}}{R_{i}}=\frac{(13.6-9)^{2}}{15.3} \cong 1.4 \mathrm{~W} \\
& I_{z}\left(\min () \frac{11-9}{15.3}\right)

\section*{Diode Rectifier}
- Rectification is the process of converting an alternating (ac) voltage into one that is limited to one polarity.
- There are two types of rectifiers: half wave rectifier and full wave rectifier.

\section*{Half wave rectifier}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-098.jpg?height=1271&width=1530&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=568)

\section*{Half wave rectifier}
- To fully analyse the diode circuit, the piecewise linear model of the diode is used.

\section*{Steps:}
1. Determine the input voltage condition such that a diode is conducting (on). Then find the output signal for this condition.
2. Determine the input voltage condition such that a diode is not conducting (off). Then find the output signal for this condition.

When $v_{s}>V_{g}$

And
$$i_{D}=\frac{v_{s}-V_{\mathrm{g}}}{R}$$
$$v_{o}=i_{D} R=v_{s}-V_{\mathrm{g}}$$

For $v_{s}>V_{\mathrm{g}}$ the slope of the transfer curve is 1 .
If $v_{s}$ is sinusoidal, the output can be determined using the voltage transfer characteristics.

\section*{Half wave rectifier}
- Consequently, the diode must be capable of handling the peak current in the forward direction and sustaining the largest peak inverse voltage (PIV) without breakdown.
- The current can be used to charge a battery.

- The primary winding connected to the ac source has $N_{1}$ windings, and each half of the secondary winding has ${ }_{N_{2}}$ windings.

\section*{Differences between center-tap and bridge Full wave rectifiers}
- Only half as many turns are required for the secondary winding in the bridge rectifier. This is true because only half of the secondary winding of the center-tapped transformer is utilized at any one time.
- For the bridge circuit, the peak inverse voltage that any diode must sustain without breakdown is only half that of the center-tapped transformer circuit.

\section*{Filter}
- The output voltage from the diode rectifier, though unipolar, contains ripples.
- These ripples can be reduced by incorporating a filter circuit.

The Bipolar Junction Transistor
- The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has three separately doped regions and contains two pn junctions.
- The basic transistor principle is that the voltage between two terminals controls the current through the third terminal.
- Current in the transistor is due to the flow of both electrons and holes, hence the name bipolar.

\section*{npn bipolar transistor}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-116.jpg?height=464&width=1635&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=561)

\section*{npn Transistor: Forward-Active Mode Operation}
- Since the transistor has two pn junctions, four possible bias combinations may be applied to the device, depending on whether a forward or reverse bias is applied to each junction.
- If the transistor is used as an amplifying device, the base-emitter ( $\mathbf{B}-E$ ) junction is forward biased and the base-collector (B$C$ ) junction is reverse biased, in a configuration called the forward-active operating mode.

\section*{Transistor Currents-forward-active mode}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-118.jpg?height=1148&width=2309&top_left_y=457&top_left_x=256)
- Emitter Current:
$$i_{E}=I_{E O}\left(e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}}-1\right) \cong I_{E O} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}}$$
- Collector Current: Due to electrons reaching the collector from the emitter region.
$$i_{C}=I_{S} e^{v_{B E} / V_{T}}$$
- The collector current is controlled by the BE voltage; in other words, the current at one terminal (the collector) is controlled by the voltage across the other two terminals. This control is the basic transistor action.

\section*{Current Relationship}

\section*{$I_{C}=\alpha I_{E}$}
- The parameter $\alpha$ is called the common-base current gain whose value is always slightly less than unity.
- Base Current: Since the B-E junction is forward biased, holes from the base are injected across the B-E junction into the emitter.
- However, because these holes do not contribute to the collector current, they are not part of the transistor action.
- Instead, the flow of holes forms one component of the base current.

\section*{Common-Emitter Current Gain}
- Shows the relationship between the base and collector current when the transistor is biased in the Forward Active Mode.
$$\beta=\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}}$$

\section*{common-emitter configuration}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-123.jpg?height=948&width=1917&top_left_y=473&top_left_x=378)
$$V_{C C}=v_{C E}+i_{C} R_{C}$$
- The base current is established by $V_{B B}$ and $R_{B}$, and the resulting collector current is $i_{C}=\beta i_{B}$.
- If we set $V_{B B}=0$, the $\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{E}$ junction will have zero applied volts; therefore, $i_{B}=0$, which implies that $i_{C}=0$. This condition is called cutoff.

\section*{Current Relationships}
$$i_{E}=i_{B}+i_{C}$$
$$i_{C}=\beta i_{B}$$
(Forward Active Mode)
$i_{E}$ Can therefore be written as:
$$\begin{aligned}
& i_{E}=(\beta+1) i_{B} \\
& \therefore i_{C}=\left(\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right) i_{E}
\end{aligned}$$

But we know: $\quad i_{C}=\alpha i_{E}$
Therefore, $\quad \alpha=\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}$
or, $\quad \beta=\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$

\section*{Example}
- An npn transistor is biased in the forwardactive mode. The base current is $I_{B}=$ $8.50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and the emitter current is $I_{E}=$ 1.20 mA . Determine $\beta, \alpha$ and $I_{C}$.

\section*{pnp Transistor: Forward-Active Mode Operation}
- The pnp transistor is complementary to the npn transistor.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-127.jpg?height=706&width=1457&top_left_y=741&top_left_x=555)
- The relationships between the terminal currents of the pnp transistor are exactly the same as those of the npn transistor.

- The arrowhead in the circuit symbol is always placed on the emitter terminal, and it indicates the direction of the emitter current.

- The current sources provide the emitter current.
- When the B-C junction becomes forward biased, the transistor is no longer in the forward-active mode, and the collector and emitter currents are no longer related by:
$$i_{C}=\alpha i_{E}$$
- When the collector-base junction is reverse biased, then for constant values of emitter current, the collector current is nearly equal to $i_{E}$

- When the collector-base junction is reverse biased, then for constant values of emitter current, the collector current is nearly equal to $i_{E}$
- These characteristics show that the common-base device is nearly an ideal constant-current source.
- When the collector-base junction becomes forward biased in the range of 0.2 and 0.3 V , the collector current is still essentially equal to the emitter current $i_{E}$.
- As the forward-bias C-B voltage increases, the linear relationship between the collector and emitter currents is no longer valid, and the collector current very quickly drops to zero.

\section*{common-emitter circuit configuration}
- The collector current is plotted against the collector-emitter voltage, for various constant values of the base current.
- In the npn device, in order for the transistor to be biased in the forward-active mode, the $B-C$ junction must be zero or reverse biased, which means that $V_{C E}>V_{B E(o n)}$
- For $V_{C E}>V_{B E(o n),}$, there is a finite slope to the curves. If, however, $V_{C E}<V_{B E(o n)}$, the B-C junction becomes forward biased, the transistor is no longer in the forward-active mode, and the collector current very quickly drops to zero.

- Base Current: $I_{B}=\frac{V_{B B}-V_{B E(o n)}}{R_{B}}$
- In the collector-emitter portion of the circuit, we can write: $I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$ and

\section*{Load Line and Modes of Operation}
- The load line helps us visualize the characteristics of a transistor.
- The load line is a graphical technique that represents the transistor operations.
- Consider the common Emitter Circuit Below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-146.jpg?height=769&width=1081&top_left_y=1040&top_left_x=954)
- The input load line can be drawn from the KVL equation of the B-E loop given as:
$$I_{B}=\frac{V_{B B}}{R_{B}}-\frac{V_{B E}}{R_{B}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-147.jpg?height=938&width=1710&top_left_y=871&top_left_x=492)
- We can also write the KVL equation for the output loop (C-E) and plot it on the transistor output characteristics. The KVL equation is:
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{C E}=V_{C C}- \\
& I_{C} R_{C} \\
& I_{C}=\frac{V_{C C}}{R_{C}}-\frac{V_{C E}}{R_{C}}=5-\frac{V_{C E}}{2} \quad m A \\
& \\
& \text { dc load line equation }
\end{aligned}$$

$V_{C E}=V_{C C}=10 \mathrm{~V}$
- The quiescent point, or Q-point, of the transistor is given by the dc collector current and the collectoremitter voltage.
- The Q-point is the intersection of the load line and the $I_{C}$ versus $V_{C E}$ curve corresponding to the appropriate base current.
- The load line is useful in visualizing the bias point of the transistor.
- If the power supply voltage in the base circuit is smaller than the turn-on voltage, then $V_{B B}<V_{B E(o n)}$ and $I_{B}=I_{C}=0$, and the transistor is in the cutoff mode.
- In this mode, all transistor currents are zero, neglecting leakage currents.
- As $V_{B B}$ increases $\left(V_{B B}>V_{B E(o n)}\right)$, the base current $I_{B}$ increases and the Q-point moves up the load line.
- As $I_{B}$ continues to increase, a point is reached where the collector current $I_{C}$ can no longer increase.
- At this point, the transistor is biased in the saturation mode; that is, the transistor is said to be in saturation.
- The B-C junction becomes forward biased, and the relationship between the collector and base currents is no longer linear.
- The transistor C-E voltage in saturation, $V_{C E(s a t)}$, is less than the B-E cut-in voltage.
- The forward-biased B-C voltage is always less than the forward-biased B-E voltage, so the C-E voltage in saturation is a small positive value. Typically, $V_{C E(\text { sat })}$ is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 V .

\section*{- Example}

For the circuit shown in the Figure below, the transistor parameters are: $\beta=100$, and $V_{B E(o n)}=0.7 \mathrm{~V}$. If the transistor is biased in saturation, assume $V_{C E(s a t)}=0.2 \mathrm{~V}$.

\section*{Summary}
- Analyzing the of a bipolar transistor circuit requires dc response knowing the mode of operation of the transistor.
- In some cases, the mode of operation may not be obvious, which means that we have to guess the state of the transistor, then analyze the circuit to determine if we have a solution consistent with our initial guess.

\section*{- Steps}
1. Assume that the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode in which case $V_{B E}=V_{B E(o n),} I_{B}>0$, and $I_{C}=\mathrm{b} I_{B}$.
2. Analyze the "linear" circuit with this assumption.
3. Evaluate the resulting state of the transistor. If the initial assumed parameter values and $V_{C E}=V_{C E(s a t)}$, are true, then the initial assumption is correct. However, if the calculation shows $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{B}}<0$, then the transistor is probably cut off, and if the calculation shows $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CE}}<0$, the transistor is likely biased in saturation.
4. If the initial assumption is proven incorrect, then a new assumption must be made and the new "linear" circuit must be analyzed. Step 3 must then be repeated.

\section*{Commonly Used Bipolar Circuits: dc Analysis}
- In addition to the common emitter configuration, there are other commonly used transistor circuits.
- BJT circuits tend to be very similar in terms of dc analysis procedures, so that the same basic analysis approach will work regardless of the appearance of the circuit.

Comparing the variation in beta for voltage divider bias and base resistor bias:
- The Change in $I_{C Q}$ and $V_{C E Q}$ is significantly reduced in voltage divider bias when compared to single base resistor bias.
- Including an emitter resistor $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{E}}$ has tended to stabilize the Q-point. This means that including the emitter resistor helps to stabilize the Q-point with respect to variations in $\beta$.

\section*{Field Effect Transistors(FETs)}
- FETs are unipolar devices because, unlike BJTs that use both electron and hole current, they operate only with one type of charge carrier.
- The two main types of FETs are the junction field-effect transistor (JFET) and the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).
- The term field-effect relates to the depletion region formed in the channel of a FET as a result of a voltage applied on one of its terminals (gate).
- The BJT transistor is a current-controlled device, whereas the JFET transistor is a voltage-controlled device.
- One of the most important characteristics of the FET is its high input impedance.
- FETs are more temperature stable than BJTs, and FETs are usually smaller than BJTs, making them particularly useful in integrated-circuit (IC) chips.

\section*{Construction of JFET}
- The JFET is a three-terminal device with one terminal capable of controlling the current between the other two.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-183.jpg?height=1179&width=1344&top_left_y=803&top_left_x=275)

N-channel JFET
- the major part of the structure is the n -type material, which forms the channel between the embedded layers of p-type material.
- The top of the n-type channel is connected through an ohmic contact to a terminal referred to as the drain (D) , whereas the lower end of the same material is connected through an ohmic contact to a terminal referred to as the source (S).
- The two p -type materials are connected together and to the gate ( G ) terminal.
- In essence, therefore, the drain and the source are connected to the ends of the n -type channel and the gate to the two layers of p -type material.

Varying reverse-bias potentials across the $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{n}$ junction of an n channel JFET.
- The result is a gate and a source terminal at the same potential and a depletion region in the low end of each $p$-material similar to the distribution of the no-bias conditions
- The instant the voltage $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}\left(=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}\right)$ is applied, the electrons are drawn to the drain terminal, establishing the conventional current $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{D}}$.
- The path of charge flow clearly reveals that the drain and source currents are equivalent ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{D}}=\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{S}}$ ).
- As the voltage $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is increased from 0 V to a few volts, the current will increase as determined by Ohm's law and the plot of $I_{D}$ versus $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ will appear.
- As $\mathrm{V}_{\text {DS }}$ increases and approaches a level referred to as $V_{\text {P. }}$
- the depletion regions will widen, causing a noticeable reduction in the channel width.
- The reduced path of conduction causes the resistance to increase
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-189.jpg?height=1091&width=1457&top_left_y=626&top_left_x=548)
- If $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ is increased to a level where it appears that the two depletion regions would "touch", a condition referred to as pinch-off will result.
- The level of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}$ that establishes this condition is referred to as the pinch-off voltage and is denoted by $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{P}}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-191.jpg?height=1064&width=867&top_left_y=580&top_left_x=794)
- At pinch-off, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{D}}$ maintains the saturation level, $\mathrm{I}_{\text {DSS }}$.

Current source equivalent for
$V_{G S}=0 V, V_{D S}>V_{P}$.
- The choice of notation $I_{D S S}$ is derived from the fact that it is the drain-to- source current with a short-circuit connection from gate to source.
- $I_{D S S}$ is the maximum drain current for a JFET and is defined by the conditions:
$$V_{G S}=0 \mathrm{~V} \text { and } \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DS}}=\left|\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{P}}\right| .$$

\section*{$V_{G S}<0 \mathrm{~V}$}
- The voltage from gate to source, denoted $V$ GS , is the controlling voltage of the JFET.
- curves of $I_{D}$ versus $V_{D S}$ for various levels of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{GS}}$ can be developed for the JFET.
- For the $\boldsymbol{n}$-channel device the controlling voltage $V_{G S}$ is made more and more negative from its $V_{G S}=0 \mathrm{~V}$ level.
- In other words, the gate terminal will be set at lower and lower potential levels as compared to the source.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-195.jpg?height=1243&width=1126&top_left_y=536&top_left_x=805)
- The effect of the applied negative-bias $V_{G S}$ is to establish depletion regions similar to those obtained with $V_{G S}=0 \mathrm{~V}$, but at lower levels of $V_{D S}$.
- Therefore, the result of applying a negative bias to the gate is to reach the saturation level at a lower level of $V_{D S}$.
- The level of $V_{G S}$ that results in $I_{D}=0 \mathrm{~mA}$ is defined by $V_{G S}=V_{P}$, with $V_{P}$ being a negative voltage for $n$-channel devices and a positive voltage for $p$-channel JFETs.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-197.jpg?height=1250&width=1920&top_left_y=417&top_left_x=345)
- On most specification sheets the pinch-off voltage is specified as $V_{G S(\text { off }}$ rather than $V_{P}$.
- The region to the right of the pinch-off locus of is the region typically employed in linear amplifiers (amplifiers with minimum distortion of the applied signal) and is commonly referred to as the constant-current, saturation, or linear amplification region.

\section*{Voltage-Controlled Resistor}
- The region to the left of the pinch-off locus is referred to as the ohmic or voltage-controlled resistance region.
- In this region the JFET can actually be employed as a variable resistor (possibly for an automatic gain control system) whose resistance is controlled by the applied gate-tosource voltage.
$$r_{d}=\frac{r_{o}}{\left(1-\frac{V_{G S}}{V_{P}}\right)^{2}}$$
where $r_{o}$ is the resistance with $V_{G S}=0 \mathrm{~V}$ and $r_{d}$ is the resistance at a particular level of $V_{G S}$

\section*{n-Channel depletion-type MOSFET}
- A slab of $p$-type material is formed from a silicon base and is referred to as the substrate.
- In some cases the substrate is internally connected to the source terminal. However, many discrete devices provide an additional terminal labeled $S S$, resulting in a fourterminal device
- The source and drain terminals are connected through metallic contacts to $n$ doped regions linked by an $n$-channel
- The gate is also connected to a metal contact surface but remains insulated from the $n$ channel by a very thin silicon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$ layer.
- $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is a type of insulator referred to as a dielectric , which sets up opposing electric fields within the dielectric when exposed to an externally applied field.
- There is no direct electrical connection between the gate terminal and the channel of a MOSFET.
- It is the insulating layer of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ in the MOSFET construction that accounts for the very desirable high input impedance of the device.

\section*{When $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{GS}}$ is set to negative}
- The negative potential at the gate will tend to pressure electrons toward the $p$-type substrate (like charges repel) and attract holes from the $p$-type substrate (opposite charges attract)
- Depending on the magnitude of the negative bias established by $V_{G S}$, a level of recombination between electrons and holes will occur that will reduce the number of free electrons in the $n$ -channel available for conduction.
- The more negative the bias, the higher is the rate of recombination. The resulting level of drain current is therefore reduced with increasing negative bias for $V_{G S}$

\section*{When $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{GS}}$ is positive}
- For positive values of $V_{G S}$, the positive gate will draw additional electrons (free carriers) from the $p$-type substrate due to the reverse leakage current and establish new carriers through the collisions resulting between accelerating particles.
- As the gate-to-source voltage continues to increase in the positive direction, the drain current will increase at a rapid rate.
- For this reason the region of positive gate voltages on the drain or transfer characteristics is often referred to as the enhancement region.
- the region between cutoff and the saturation level of $I_{D S S}$ referred to as the depletion region

\section*{Note}
- Shockley's equation will continue to be applicable for the depletion-type MOSFET characteristics in both the depletion and enhancement regions.
- For both regions, it is simply necessary that the proper sign be included with $V_{G S}$ in the equation and the sign be carefully monitored in the mathematical operations.

Graphic symbols for: $n$-channel depletion-type MOSFETs and p-channel depletion-type MOSFETs.

\section*{Enhancement type MOSFET}
- The transfer curve is not defined by Shockley's equation, and the drain current is now cut off until the gate-to source voltage reaches a specific magnitude.
- In particular, current control in an $n-$ channel device is now effected by a positive gate-to-source voltage rather than the range of negative voltages encountered for $n$ channel JFETs and $n$-channel depletion-type MOSFETs.

\section*{N-channel e-MOSFET}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-219.jpg?height=1159&width=1240&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=762)

The construction of an enhancement-type MOSFET is quite similar to that of the depletiontype MOSFET, except for the absence of a channel between the drain and source terminals.

\section*{Channel Formation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_6826a497cc5360c48acdg-220.jpg?height=1323&width=1232&top_left_y=573&top_left_x=647)
- The positive potential at the gate will pressure the holes (since like charges repel) in the $p$-substrate along the edge of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer to leave the area and enter deeper regions of the $p$-substrate.
- The result is a depletion region near the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ insulating layer void of holes.
- However, the electrons in the $p$-substrate (the minority carriers of the material) will be attracted to the positive gate and accumulate in the region near the surface of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer.
- The SiO2 layer and its insulating qualities will prevent the negative carriers from being absorbed at the gate terminal.
- As $V_{G S}$ increases in magnitude, the concentration of electrons near the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface increases until eventually the induced $n$-type region can support a measurable flow between drain and source.
- The level of $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{GS}}$ that results in the significant increase in drain current is called the threshold voltage and is given the symbol $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{T}}$ or $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{G S}(\mathbf{T h})}$
- Since the channel is nonexistent with $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{GS}}=0 \mathrm{~V}$ and "enhanced" by the application of a positive gate-tosource voltage, this type of MOSFET is called an enhancement-type MOSFET.
- Both depletion- and enhancement type MOSFETs have enhancement-type regions, but the label was applied to the latter since it is its only mode of operation.
- As $V_{G S}$ is increased beyond the threshold level, the density of free carriers in the induced channel will increase, resulting in an increased level of drain current.
- However, if we hold $V_{G S}$ constant and increase the level of $V_{D S}$, the drain current will eventually reach a saturation level as occurred for the JFET and depletion-type MOSFET.
- The leveling off of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{D}}$ is due to a pinching-off process depicted by the narrower channel at the drain end of the induced channel

$$V_{D G}=V_{D S}-V_{G S}$$
- If $V_{G S}$ is held fixed at some value such as 8 V and $V D S$ is increased from 2 V to 5 V , the voltage $V_{D G}$ will increase from -6 V to -3 V and the gate will become less and less positive with respect to the drain.
- This reduction in gate-to-drain voltage will in turn reduce the attractive forces for free carriers (electrons) in this region of the induced channel, causing a reduction in the effective channel width.
- Eventually, the channel will be reduced to the point of pinch-off and a saturation condition will be established

- For values of $V_{G S}$ less than the threshold level, the drain current of an enhancement type MOSFET is 0 mA .
- the drain current is related to the applied gate-to-source voltage by the following nonlinear relationship:
$$I_{D}=k\left(V_{G S}-V_{T}\right)^{2}$$
- The $k$ term is a constant that is a function of the construction of the device.
- The value of $k$ can be determined from:
$$k=\frac{I_{D(o n)}}{\left(V_{G S(o n)}-V_{T}\right)^{2}}$$
where $I_{D(0)}$ and $V_{G s m_{m}}$ are the values for each at a particular point on the characteristics of the device.

- They do not change with each network configuration so long as the device is in the active region.
- The network simply defines the level of current and voltage associated with the operating point through its own set of equations.
- In reality, the dc solution of BJT and FET networks is the solution of simultaneous equations established by the device and the network.

\section*{Solution}

KVL for input loop (G-S)
$$\begin{aligned}
& +2+V_{G S Q}=0 ; \quad V_{G S Q}=-2 V \\

\end{aligned}$$

Writing KVL for output loop (D-S)
$$\begin{aligned}
& -16+I_{D} R_{D}+V_{D S}=0 ; \quad V_{D S Q}=16-(5.625)(2 \mathrm{~kW})=4.75 \mathrm{~V} \\
& V_{D S}=V_{D}-V_{S} ; \quad V_{D}=V_{D S}+V_{S}=4.75+0=4.75 \mathrm{~V} \\
& V_{G S}=V_{G}-V_{S} ; \quad V_{G}=V_{G S}+V_{S}=-2+0=-2 \mathrm{~V} \\
& V_{S}=0 \mathrm{~V}

\section*{Self Bias Configuration}

\section*{Solution}

KVL for input loop (G-S)
$$\begin{aligned}
& +V_{G S Q}+I_{S} R_{S}=0 ; \quad I_{S}=I_{D}=I_{D S S}\left(1-\frac{V_{G S}}{V_{P}}\right)^{2} \\
& =8\left(1-\frac{V_{G S}}{-6}\right)^{2} \\
& V_{G S}=-1 \times I_{D}=-I_{D} \\
& \therefore I_{D}=8\left(1-\frac{-I_{D}}{-6}\right)^{2} ; \quad I_{D}=8\left(1-\frac{I_{D}}{6}\right)^{2} \Rightarrow I_{D} \\
& =8\left(1-2\left(\frac{I_{D}}{6}\right)+\left(\frac{I_{D}}{6}\right)^{2}\right) \\
& I_{D}=8\left(1-\frac{I_{D}}{3}+\frac{I_{D}{ }^{2}}{36}\right) \Rightarrow \frac{I_{D}{ }^{2}}{36}-\left(\frac{I_{D}}{3}+\frac{I_{D}}{8}\right)+1=0 \\
& I_{D}=13.9 A \text { or } 2.59 A
\end{aligned}$$

Since $\mathrm{I}_{D}$ cannot be larger than $I_{D S S}$, therefore $I_{D Q}=2.59 A$
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{G S}=-I_{D} \\
& \therefore V_{G S Q}=-2.6 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}$$

KVL for output loop (D-S)
$-20+I_{D}\left(R_{D}+R_{s}\right)+V_{D S}=0 ; \quad V_{D S}=20-(2.59)(3.3+1)=8.863 \mathrm{~V}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{S}=I_{S} R_{S}=I_{D} R_{s}=(2.6)(1)=2.6 \mathrm{~V} \\
& V_{G S}=V_{G}-V_{S} \\
& V_{G}=V_{G S}+V_{S}=-2.6+2.6=0 \mathrm{~V} \\
& V_{D S}=V_{D}-V_{S} \\
& V_{D}=V_{D S}+V_{S}=8.863+2.6=11.463 \mathrm{~V}
