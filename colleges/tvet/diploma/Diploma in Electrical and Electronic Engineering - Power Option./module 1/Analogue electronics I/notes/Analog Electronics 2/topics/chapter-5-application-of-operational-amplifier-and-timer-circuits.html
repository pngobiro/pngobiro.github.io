                        <p>One of the most common application problems encountered is the failure to provide a dc return path for bias current in ac-coupled operational- or instrumentation-amplifier circuits. In Figure 1, a capacitor is connected in series with the noninverting (+) input of an op amp to ac couple it, an easy way to block dc voltages that are associated with the input voltage ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{V}_{\text {IN }}$</span> ). This should be especially useful in high-gain applications, where even a small dc voltage at an amplifier's input can limit the dynamic range, or even result in output saturation. However, capacitively coupling into a high-impedance input, without providing a dc path for current flowing in the + input, will lead to trouble!</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The resistive transducer bridge is a network of resistors whose resistance varies due to changes in some physical condition. For example, Thermistors change their resistance with temperature and Light Dependent Resistors change their resistance to change in light intensity. By making such a bridge as a part of the circuit, it is possible to produce an electrical signal proportional to the change in the physical quantity being measured. Such an electrical signal can be amplified and used to monitor and control the physical process. An instrumentation amplifier can be constructed with a transducer bridge connected to one of its input terminals, as shown in the figure below.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_b4284c6709692f5eeb41g-39-2.jpg" alt="Instrumentation amplifier circuit with a transducer bridge. The bridge consists of Rc, Transducer (Rt +/- dR), Ra, Rb. Vdc supplies the bridge. Voltages Va and Vb from the bridge go to the inputs of an instrumentation amplifier (made of three op-amps and resistors R2, R3). The output Vo drives a display device." class="content-image">
                        <p>Let the resistance of the transducer device in the resistive bridge be <span class="math-inline">$R_{T}$</span> and the change in its resistance be <span class="math-inline">$\Delta R$</span>. The effective resistance of the transducer device is <span class="math-inline">$R_{T} \pm \Delta R$</span>. The resistive bridge is supplied with a <span class="math-inline">$D C$</span> voltage, <span class="math-inline">$V_{d c}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>When the bridge is balanced, i.e. at some reference condition of the physical quantity being measured, we get,</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{b}} \quad$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{A}}(\mathrm{Vdc}) /\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{A}}+\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{B}}(\mathrm{Vdc}) /\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{B}}+\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{C}}\right)$</span></p>

                        <p>Thus, the output of the amplifier is zero. Consequently, the display device connected at the output displays the reference value of the physical quantity being measured. The reference condition is generally chosen by the designer and it depends on the device characteristics of the transducer, the type of physical quantity being measured and the type of the application.</p>
                        <p>When there is a change in the physical quantity being measured, the voltage <span class="math-inline">$V_{a}$</span> will no longer be equal to <span class="math-inline">$V_{b}$</span>. This is because the resistance of the transducer device changes from <span class="math-inline">$R_{T}$</span> to ( <span class="math-inline">$R_{T} \pm \Delta R$</span> ). This produces a differential input for the instrumentation amplifier and the output of the amplifier will no longer be zero.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>By introducing electrical reactance into the feedback loops of op-amp amplifier circuits, we can cause the output to respond to changes in the input voltage over time. Drawing their names from their respective calculus functions, the integrator produces a voltage output proportional to the product (multiplication) of the input voltage and time; and the differentiator (not to be confused with differential) produces a voltage output proportional to the input voltage's rate of change.</p>
                        <p>Capacitance can be defined as the measure of a capacitor's opposition to changes in voltage. The greater the capacitance, the more the opposition. Capacitors oppose voltage change by creating current in the circuit: that is, they either charge or discharge in response to a change in applied voltage. So, the more capacitance a capacitor has, the greater its charge or discharge current will be for any given rate of voltage change across it. The equation for this is quite simple:</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_b4284c6709692f5eeb41g-41-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing a changing DC voltage source connected to a capacitor C, with the equation i = C * dv/dt." class="content-image">
                        <p>The <span class="math-inline">$d v / d t$</span> fraction is a calculus expression representing the rate of voltage change over time. If the DC supply in the above circuit were steadily increased from a voltage of 15 volts to a voltage of 16 volts over a time span of 1 hour, the current through the capacitor would most likely be very small, because of the very low rate of voltage change ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{dv} / \mathrm{dt}=1$</span> volt / 3600 seconds). However, if we steadily increased the DC supply from 15 volts to 16 volts over a shorter time span of 1 second, the rate of voltage change would be much higher, and thus the charging current would be much higher ( 3600 times higher, to be exact). Same amount of change in voltage, but vastly different rates of change, resulting in vastly different amounts of current in the circuit.</p>
                        <p>To put some definite numbers to this formula, if the voltage across a <span class="math-inline">$47 \mu \mathrm{~F}$</span> capacitor was changing at a linear rate of 3 volts per second, the current "through" the capacitor would be <span class="math-inline">$(47 \mu \mathrm{~F})(3 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{s})=141 \mu \mathrm{A}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>We can build an op-amp circuit which measures change in voltage by measuring current through a capacitor, and outputs a voltage proportional to that current:</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_b4284c6709692f5eeb41g-42-1.jpg" alt="Op-amp differentiator circuit. Vin is connected to a capacitor C, which is connected to the inverting input. A resistor R is in the feedback loop. Non-inverting input is grounded. Output is Vout." class="content-image">
                        <p>The right-hand side of the capacitor is held to a voltage of 0 volts, due to the "virtual ground" effect. Therefore, current "through" the capacitor is solely due to change in the input voltage. A steady input voltage won't cause a current through C, but a changing input voltage will.</p>
                        <p>Capacitor current moves through the feedback resistor, producing a drop across it, which is the same as the output voltage. A linear, positive rate of input voltage change will result in a steady negative voltage at the output of the op-amp. Conversely, a linear, negative rate of input voltage change will result in a steady positive voltage at the output of the op-amp. This polarity inversion from input to output is due to the fact that the input signal is being sent (essentially) to the inverting input of the op-amp, so it acts like the inverting amplifier mentioned previously. The faster the rate of voltage change at the input (either positive or negative), the greater the voltage at the output.</p>
                        <p>The formula for determining voltage output for the differentiator is as follows:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{V}_{\text {out }}=-\mathrm{RC} \frac{\mathrm{dv}_{\text {in }}}{\mathrm{dt}}$$</div>
                        <p>Applications for this, besides representing the derivative calculus function inside of an analog computer, include rate-of-change indicators for process instrumentation. One such rate-of-change signal application might be for monitoring (or controlling) the rate of temperature change in a furnace, where too high or too low of a temperature rise rate could be detrimental. The DC voltage produced by the differentiator circuit could be used to drive a comparator, which would signal an alarm or activate a control if the rate of change exceeded a pre-set level.</p>
                        <p>In process control, the derivative function is used to make control decisions for maintaining a process at setpoint, by monitoring the rate of process change over time and taking action to prevent excessive rates of change, which can lead to an unstable condition. Analog electronic controllers use variations of this circuitry to perform the derivative function. On the other hand, there are applications where we need precisely the opposite function, called integration in calculus. Here, the op-amp circuit would generate an output voltage proportional to the magnitude and duration that an input voltage signal has deviated from 0 volts. Stated differently, a constant input signal would generate a certain rate of change in the output voltage: differentiation in reverse. To do this, all we have to do is swap the capacitor and resistor in the previous circuit:</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_b4284c6709692f5eeb41g-43-1.jpg" alt="Op-amp integrator circuit. Vin is connected to a resistor R, which is connected to the inverting input. A capacitor C is in the feedback loop. Non-inverting input is grounded. Output is Vout." class="content-image">
                        <p>As before, the negative feedback of the op-amp ensures that the inverting input will be held at 0 volts (the virtual ground). If the input voltage is exactly 0 volts, there will be no current through the resistor, therefore no charging of the capacitor, and therefore the output voltage will not change. We cannot guarantee what voltage will be at the output with respect to ground in this condition, but we can say that the output voltage will be constant.</p>
                        <p>However, if we apply a constant, positive voltage to the input, the op-amp output will fall negative at a linear rate, in an attempt to produce the changing voltage across the capacitor necessary to maintain the current established by the voltage difference across the resistor. Conversely, a constant, negative voltage at the input results in a linear, rising (positive) voltage at the output. The output voltage rate-of-change will be proportional to the value of the input voltage.</p>
                        <p>The formula for determining voltage output for the integrator is as follows:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{\mathrm{dv}_{\text {out }}}{\mathrm{dt}}=-\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\text {in }}}{\mathrm{RC}}$$</div>

                        <p>An active filter is a type of analog electronic filter that uses active components such as an amplifier. Amplifiers included in a filter design can be used to improve the performance and predictability of a filter,<sup>[1]</sup> while avoiding the need for inductors (which are typically expensive compared to other components). An amplifier prevents the load impedance of the following stage from affecting the characteristics of the filter. An active filter can have complex poles and zeros without using a bulky or expensive inductor. The shape of the response, the Q (quality factor), and the tuned frequency can often be set with inexpensive variable resistors. In some active filter circuits, one parameter can be adjusted without affecting the others.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
                        <p>Using active elements has some limitations. Basic filter design equations neglect the finite bandwidth of amplifiers. Available active devices have limited bandwidth, so they are often impractical at high frequencies. Amplifiers consume power and inject noise into a system. Certain circuit topologies may be impractical if no DC path is provided for bias current to the amplifier elements.

                        <p>Wien bridge oscillator is an audio frequency sine wave oscillator of high stability and simplicity. Before that let us see what is oscillator?

One of the most common uses of the current to voltage converter is in digital to analog circuits and in sensing current through photo detectors such as photocells, photodiodes and photovoltaic cells. Photosensitive devices produce a current that is proportional to an incident radiant energy or light and therefore can be used to detect the light.</p>

These converters have the same internal circuitry and connection diagrams, but they differ slightly in electrical characteristics. A complete V/F or F/V system can be formed simply by using two external capacitors, three resistors and a reference voltage. The 9400 series consists of CMOS and bipolar devices that can operate on dual or single supply voltages.</p>

                        <p>The 9400 is designed for pulse and square wave outputs having a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz . The input can be either current or voltage and the output can interface with most forms of logic. The equivalent circuit consists of an integrator, comparators, a delay network, a divide-by-2 network, an open - collector output transistors. The input current is converted to a charge by the integrating capacitor and shows up as a linearly decreasing voltage at the output of the op amp integrator. The output of the integrator is sensed by the comparator. The output of the comparator is then applied via the delay network to the output transistor Q1,the divide-by-2 network, and the charge/discharge control unit. The output of the divide-by-2 network drives the output transistor Q2.</p>
