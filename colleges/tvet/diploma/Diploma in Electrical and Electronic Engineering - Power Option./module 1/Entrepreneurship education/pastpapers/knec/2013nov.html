                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-1">
                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p><strong>(a) Explain the functions of the following units found in the Central Processing Unit:</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(i) The control unit:</strong> The control unit is the component of the CPU that manages and coordinates all the activities of the computer system. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them by sending control signals to other components of the CPU and the rest of the computer.</p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>(ii) the arithmetic unit:</strong> The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical operations include AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Differentiate between RAM and ROM:</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> RAM is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly; that is, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes. RAM is volatile, meaning that data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. RAM is used to store the operating system, application programs, and data that are currently being used by the computer.</p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> ROM is a type of computer memory that can only be read; it cannot be written to. ROM is non-volatile, meaning that data stored in ROM is not lost when the computer is turned off. ROM is used to store the boot program and other essential system software.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) (i) Create the following spreadsheet and answer the questions that follow:</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>I) Enter formula for computing the total marks for each student:</strong> In a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you would enter the following formula in the "Total" column for each student: <code>=SUM(B2:D2)</code> (assuming the Maths, English, and Biology marks are in columns B, C, and D, respectively, and the first student's data starts in row 2). You would then copy this formula down to the other students' rows.</p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>II) Identify a formula that can be able to compute the highest marks for each subject:</strong> To compute the highest marks for each subject, you would use the <code>MAX</code> function. For example, to find the highest mark in Maths, you would enter the following formula in a separate cell: <code>=MAX(B2:B6)</code> (assuming the Maths marks are in column B and the student data spans rows 2 to 6). You would repeat this for English and Biology, adjusting the column range accordingly.</p>
                                <p>(ii) Outline the procedure theo would use to copy data from an existing spread sheet workshect to a new worksheet:</p>
                                <ol class="indented-1">
                                    <li><strong>Open both the existing spreadsheet and the new worksheet.</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>Select the data</strong> you want to copy from the existing spreadsheet.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Copy the data</strong> by pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code> (or <code>Cmd+C</code> on macOS) or by right-clicking and selecting "Copy."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Navigate to the new worksheet.</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>Select the cell</strong> where you want to paste the data.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Paste the data</strong> by pressing <code>Ctrl+V</code> (or <code>Cmd+V</code> on macOS) or by right-clicking and selecting "Paste."</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(d) Differentiate between source document file and data document file used in word processing mail merge:</strong></p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>Source document file:</strong> In word processing mail merge, the source document file (also known as the main document) contains the text and formatting that will be the same for all merged documents. This includes the letter body, headings, and any other static content.</p>
                                <p class="indented-1"><strong>Data document file:</strong> The data document file (also known as the data source) contains the variable information that will be inserted into the source document during the mail merge process. This typically includes names, addresses, and other personalized data for each recipient.</p>
