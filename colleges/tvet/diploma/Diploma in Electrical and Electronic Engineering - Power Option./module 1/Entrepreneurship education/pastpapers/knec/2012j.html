                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Ergonomics in ICT:</strong> Ergonomics, in the context of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), is the study of designing and arranging workplaces, products, and systems so that they fit the people who use them. It focuses on improving efficiency, productivity, comfort, and safety by considering the physical and cognitive capabilities and limitations of users.</p>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Features for Mr. Mop's son's computer:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Screen Magnification Software:</strong> This software enlarges the content displayed on the screen, making it easier for individuals with low vision to see. The magnification level can be adjusted to suit the user's needs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Screen Reader Software:</strong> This software converts text displayed on the screen into speech, allowing the user to hear the content instead of reading it. This is particularly useful for individuals who are blind or have severe visual impairments.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Types of bus in a computer system:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> This bus carries data between the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The width of the data bus (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) determines the amount of data that can be transferred at once.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Address Bus:</strong> This bus carries the memory addresses that the CPU wants to access. The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory that the CPU can address.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Advantages of laser technology in DVDs:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Storage Capacity:</strong> Laser technology allows for smaller pits and lands on the DVD surface, which means more data can be stored on a DVD compared to a CD.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Data Density:</strong> The smaller laser beam used in DVDs enables higher data density, resulting in more information being packed into the same physical space.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(c) Primary vs. Secondary Storage:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Primary Storage (Main Memory):</strong> This is the computer's main memory, such as RAM (Random Access Memory). It is volatile, meaning data is lost when the power is turned off. It provides fast access to data that the CPU is actively using.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Secondary Storage:</strong> This is non-volatile storage, such as hard drives, SSDs (Solid State Drives), and USB flash drives. It provides long-term storage for data and programs, even when the power is turned off. Access to data in secondary storage is slower than in primary storage.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(d) (i) Leased Line vs. Dial-up Line:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Leased Line:</strong> A leased line is a dedicated, fixed-bandwidth connection between two points. It provides a constant, reliable connection and is typically used by businesses that require high-speed internet access.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dial-up Line:</strong> A dial-up line uses a modem to connect to the internet over a telephone line. It is a slower, less reliable connection compared to a leased line.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(d) (ii) Advantages of using leasing line for internet connection:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Leased lines provide a dedicated connection, ensuring consistent and reliable internet access.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High Bandwidth:</strong> Leased lines offer higher bandwidth compared to dial-up or other shared connections, allowing for faster data transfer speeds.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-2">
                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p><strong>(a) (i) URL:</strong> A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It is a standardized naming convention for addressing documents accessible over the Internet.</p>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) HTML:</strong> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page, using tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.</p>
                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Advantages of OMR over OCR:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) is generally faster than OCR (Optical Character Recognition) because it only needs to detect the presence or absence of a mark, rather than recognizing complex characters.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> OMR is more accurate than OCR for reading marked data because it is less susceptible to errors caused by variations in handwriting or print quality.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Disadvantages of OMR compared to OCR:</strong></p>

                                    <li><strong>Limited Data Input:</strong> OMR can only read pre-defined marks, limiting the type of data that can be input. OCR can read a wider range of characters and text.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inflexibility:</strong> OMR is less flexible than OCR because it requires specific forms with marked areas. OCR can read text from various sources, including scanned documents and images.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(c) (i) Advantages of using DBMS for online ticket booking:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> A DBMS (Database Management System) ensures data integrity by enforcing constraints and rules, preventing inconsistent or invalid data from being stored.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> A DBMS provides security features such as user authentication and access control, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(c) (ii) Limitations of the above system:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Implementing and maintaining a DBMS can be expensive, requiring specialized hardware, software, and personnel.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> A DBMS can be complex to design and administer, requiring expertise in database management and system administration.</li>
                                </ul>
