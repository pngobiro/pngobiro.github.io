                        <p>Interest in the development of entrepreneurship and small enterprise in Kenya gained momentum as a possible remedy to the stagnation of economic development and the escalating unemployment problem between the early 1960 and 1970s.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although there were attempts by the government to develop entrepreneurship, the main impetus came from the international labor organization (ILO) report.</p>
                        
                        <p>The report centered on the potential of the informal sector and suggested that the bulk of Kenya's urban workers were self-employed in small enterprises.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The report proposed that the development of this sector could:</h3>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Based on this report the government responded with a seasonal paper in 1973 – which recognized the role of entrepreneurship in employment creation not just in the formal sector but also in the formal sector.</p>
