                        <p>The economic prospective is important since they create enabling environment for the entrepreneur to combine the factors of production.</p>

                        <h3>II. Psychological Factors</h3>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Richard Cantilon</h3>
                        <p>An entrepreneur as a person with foresight and competence to operate in conditions on uncertainty. Richard was particular about an entrepreneur being a person who performed in uncertain environments because the market demand is not perfectly predictable not necessarily that his products are untested an untried. Cantilon contributed to the contention that an entrepreneur is somebody who has foresight and confidence to operate under conditions of uncertainty. He associated risks and uncertainties with administrative decisions of entrepreneurs. He identified the factor that profit to the entrepreneur arises out of decision making and risk taking.</p>

                        <h3>John Baptiste</h3>
                        <p>Entrepreneurs coordinate and combine the factors of production. John described the entrepreneur as a rare phenomenon who is able to coordinate and combine the factors of production. He places emphasis on the variety of markers and inputs which the entrepreneur has to deal with "successfully". In effect, the entrepreneur is expected to "perceive and realize potential arbitrage" in addition to taking risks associated with uncertainty. According to say, the entrepreneur must surmount abundant obstacles, suppress anxieties, repair misfortunes and devise expedients. As a result, the entrepreneur accommodates the unexpected and overcome problems successfully in dealing both the input and consumer market. A possible conclusion form this contention is that the entrepreneur is a locator of resources in the adjustment process during equilibrium, towards equilibrium.</p>

                        <h3>Carl Menger (1950) and the Austrian School</h3>
                        <p>The Austrian school in economics emphasizes the locative role in directing that entrepreneurs role is that of risk taker in an uncertain environment. They added that the entrepreneur needs information and has to have the ability to analyze and use this information to make the correct decision in allocating resources. Other followers of the Austrian school of Thought went on to add that the alertness, superior perception and leadership of the entrepreneur cause factors of production to be allocated and continuously allocated.</p>
