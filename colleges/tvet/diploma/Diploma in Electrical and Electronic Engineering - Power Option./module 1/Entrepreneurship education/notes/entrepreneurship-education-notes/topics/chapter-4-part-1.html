                                <h3>1. Entrepreneurs don't have a personal life</h3>
                                <p class="myth">Most people think that entrepreneurs work throughout and this means that you will not have time for your family, friends and leisure activities.</p>
                                <p class="reality">Since entrepreneurs are their own bosses, they can schedule their own hours and stick to that time because a good entrepreneur manages his time well.</p>

                                <p class="reality">Financial gain is not the only motivation to small business owners but achieving a lifelong dream is the main motivation for entrepreneurs.</p>

                                <p class="reality">This is not true because not all entrepreneurs raise money from venture capitalists but instead personal loans, friends and family are other sources that outweigh venture capitalist.</p>
