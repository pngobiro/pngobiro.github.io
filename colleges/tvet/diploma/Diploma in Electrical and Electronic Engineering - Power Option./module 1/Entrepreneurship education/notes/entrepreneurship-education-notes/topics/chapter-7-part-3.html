                                <p>Human resource (personnel) refers to the employees working in an organization. Employees will only be useful if they have the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully carry out the assigned tasks. Management must match the correct people with the correct job activities to ensure business success.</p>

                                <p>Money is required to start and operate a business. A business with adequate finances that are properly allocated to various activities and monitored is likely to do better than one lacking such aspects.</p>

                                <p>Often the only source available for sole traders starting in business. While partnerships have more people involved, this capital is often quickly turned into fixed assets. Business owners could invest more money if there's a cash flow shortfall, but they may have already invested all their capital or be unwilling to risk further investment.</p>

                                <p>Firms make profit by selling a product for more than it costs to produce. This is the most basic source of funds for any company and hopefully the method that brings in the most money.</p>

                                <p>Companies can borrow money privately through bank loans or publicly through debt issues. The drawback is the interest that must be paid to the lender.</p>

                                <p>A company can generate money by selling part of itself in the form of shares to investors (equity funding). While investors don't require interest payments, profits must be divided among all shareholders.</p>

                                <p>A form of bank loan where a business can withdraw more money than it has in its account. While often a cheap way of borrowing money, the bank:</p>
