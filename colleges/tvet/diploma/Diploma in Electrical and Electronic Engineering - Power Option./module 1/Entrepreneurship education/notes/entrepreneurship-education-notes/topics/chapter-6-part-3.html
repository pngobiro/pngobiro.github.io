                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A co-operative society is a form of business organization that is owned by and run for the economic welfare of its members. It is a body of persons who have joined together to do collectively what they were previously doing individually for mutual benefit.</p>

                            <h3>Historical Example</h3>
                            <p>In Kenya, the co-operative movement was started by white settlers in 1908 to market their agricultural produce. They knew that they could sell their produce better if they were as a group and not alone.</p>

                                <p>Membership is open and voluntary to any person who has attained the age of 18 years. No one should be denied membership due to social, political, tribal or religious differences. A member is also free to leave the society at will.</p>

                                <p>The principle is one man one vote. Each member has only one vote irrespective of the number of shares held or how much they buy or sell to the society.</p>
