      <h2>Definition of Management</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The emergence of management as an essential distinct and leading institution is a pivotal event in social history, purely if ever has a new leading group emerged as fast as has management since the turn of 20th century." - Peter W. Drucker</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Management can be defined as principally a task of planning, coordinating, and motivating the efforts of others towards specific objectives. All kinds of institutions – social, political, religious, etc. are formed by groups of individuals to pursue common goals and objectives.</p>

    <section class="key-concepts">
      <h2>Management vs Administration</h2>

            <li>Determinative function</li>
            <li>Concerned with objective and policy determination</li>

          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
