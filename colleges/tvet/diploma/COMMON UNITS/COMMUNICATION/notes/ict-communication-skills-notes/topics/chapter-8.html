                        <p>A <b>summary</b> is a <b>shortened passage</b>, which retains the <b>essential information</b> of the original. It is a fairly brief restatement ---in your own words---of the contents of a passage. <b>Note:</b> you simply report back what the writer has said, without making value judgments.</p>
                        <p>A summary is a <b>condensed version</b> of a larger reading. A summary is <b>not a rewrite</b> of the original piece and does not have to be long nor should it be long. To write a summary, use your own words to express briefly the <b>main idea</b> and <b>relevant details</b> of the piece you have read. Your purpose in writing the summary is to give the <b>basic ideas</b> of the original reading. What was it about and what did the author want to communicate?</p>
                        <p>While reading the original work, take note of what or who is the focus and ask the usual questions that reporters use: <b>Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?</b> Using these questions to examine what you are reading can help you to write the summary.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, the <b>central idea</b> of the piece is stated in the introduction or first paragraph, and the <b>supporting ideas</b> of this central idea are presented one by one in the following paragraphs. Always read the introductory paragraph thoughtfully and look for a <b>thesis statement</b>. Finding the thesis statement is like finding a key to a locked door. Frequently, however, the <b>thesis</b>, or <b>central idea</b>, is implied or suggested. Thus, you will have to work harder to figure out what the author wants readers to understand. Use any hints that may shed light on the meaning of the piece: pay attention to the title and any headings and to the opening and closing lines of paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>In writing the summary, let your reader know the piece that you are summarizing. Identify the title, author and source of the piece. You may want to use this formula:</p>
                        <p>In "Title of the Piece" (source and date of piece), author shows that: central idea of the piece. The author supports the main idea by using and showing that -.</p>
                        <p>Here is a sample summary:</p>
                        <p>In the short story "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," author James Thurber humorously presents a character who fantasizes about himself as a hero enduring incredibly challenging circumstances. In his real life, Walter Mitty lives an ordinary, plain life; he is a husband under the control of an overbearing, critical wife. Thurber uses lively dialogue to give readers an understanding of Mitty's character. The story takes place over a period of about twenty minutes; during this brief time, Mitty drives his wife to the hairdresser and runs errands that his wife has given him while he waits for her. In between his worrying that he is not doing what she wants him to do, he daydreams about himself as a great surgeon, brilliant repair technician, expert marksman, and brave military captain. This story shows that fantasy is often a good alternative to reality.</p>
                        <p><b>Remember:</b></p>

                        <p>Characteristics of a good summary</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can be understood without reference to the original;</li>
                            <li>Is a faithful reproduction of, or contains only the ideas or information of, the original;</li>
                            <li>Is brief without any unnecessary detail; Is a readable unified whole</li>
                            <li>An effective summary captures the most important information</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The important information usually includes controlling ideas (purpose statements and topic sentences), major findings, and conclusions or recommendations. It usually doesn't include any of the following: non-essential background information; the author's personal comments or conjectures; introductions; long explanations, examples, or definitions; visuals; or data of questionable accuracy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An effective summary is highly readable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>People read summaries to get the information they need as efficiently as possible. In a large document, the summary may be the only part a reader actually reads. Make sure to write in a readable, clear style. Translate specific details into general statements (e.g., instead of " $47.3 \%$ of respondents polled said they agreed or strongly agreed that food labels should include information about the percentage of trans fats the food item contained," summarize to "Almost half of respondents want food labels to include trans fats").</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An effective summary can stand on its own</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Think of your summary as a highly condensed version of the source document. All the extras have been squeezed out, but the essential meaning should still be there. A reader should be able to read, understand and find the essential meaning by reading your summary. Readers should have to turn to the source document only if they need more detail-not to get the main ideas.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An effective summary is faithful to the original</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a rule, add nothing to the original. Avoid adding comments or modifiers that add meaning that was not in the original (e.g. "The authors correctly point out," "The report seems to suggest," "This important recommendation").</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An effective summary is as concise as possible</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use the fewest words possible that still preserve all the essential meaning. Whatever you do, don't sacrifice clarity for economy.</p>
