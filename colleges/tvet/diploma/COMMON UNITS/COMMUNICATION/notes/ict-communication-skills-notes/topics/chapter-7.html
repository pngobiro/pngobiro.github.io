                        <p>Punctuation Marks</p>
                        <img src="https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_13_7479a6441ff2da13e013g-46.jpg?height=388&width=367&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1389" alt="Punctuation Marks">
                        <p>There are fourteen punctuation marks commonly used in English grammar. They are the period, question mark, exclamation point, comma, semicolon, colon, dash, hyphen, parentheses, brackets, braces, apostrophe, quotation marks, and ellipsis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üõë</span> Sentence Endings</h3>
                        <p>Three of the fourteen punctuation marks are appropriate for use as sentence endings. They are the period, question mark, and exclamation point.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The period (.) is placed at the end of declarative sentences, statements thought to be complete and after many abbreviations.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>As a sentence ender: Jane and Jack went to the market.</li>
                                    <li>After an abbreviation: Her son, John Jones Jr., was born on Dec. 6, 2008.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Use a question mark (?) to indicate a direct question when placed at the end of a sentence.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When did Jane leave for the market?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The exclamation point (!) is used when a person wants to express a sudden outcry or add emphasis.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Within dialogue: "Holy cow!" screamed Jane.</li>
                                    <li>To emphasize a point: My mother-in-law's rants make me furious!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">,;</span> Comma, Semicolon and Colon</h3>
                        <p>The comma, semicolon and colon are often misused because they all can indicate a pause in a series.</p>
                        <p>The comma is used to show a separation of ideas or elements within the structure of a sentence. Additionally, it is used in numbers, dates and letter writing after the salutation and closing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Direct address: Thanks for all your help, John.</li>
                            <li>Separation of two complete sentences: We went to the movies, and then we went out to lunch.</li>
                            <li>Separating lists or elements within sentences: Suzi wanted the black, green, and blue dress. Whether to add a final comma before the conjunction in a list is a matter of debate. This final comma, known as an Oxford or serial comma, is useful in a complex series of elements or phrases but is often considered unnecessary in a simple series such as in the example above. It usually comes down to a style choice by the writer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The semicolon (;) is used to connect independent clauses. It shows a closer relationship between the clauses than a period would show.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>John was hurt; he knew she only said it to upset him.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A colon (:) has three main uses. The first is after a word introducing a quotation, an explanation, an example, or a series.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He was planning to study four subjects: politics, philosophy, sociology and economics. The second is between independent clauses, when the second explains the first, similar to a semicolon:</li>
                            <li>I didn't have time to get changed: I was already late. The third use of a colon is for emphasis:</li>
                            <li>There was one thing she loved more that any other: her dog.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A colon also has non-grammatical uses in time, ratio, business correspondence and references.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚Äî</span> Dash and the Hyphen</h3>
                        <p>Two other common punctuation marks are the dash and hyphen. These marks are often confused with each other due to their appearance but they are very different.</p>
                        <p>A hyphen is used to join two or more words together into a compound term and is not separated by spaces. For example, part-time, back-to-back, well-known.</p>
                        <p>A dash is used to separate words into statements. There are two common types of dashes: en dash and em dash.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>En dash: Slightly wider than a hyphen, the en dash is a symbol ( - ) that is used in writing or printing to indicate a range or connections and differentiations, such as 1880-1945 or Princeton-New York trains.</li>
                            <li>Em dash: Twice as long as the en dash, the em dash can be used in place of a comma, parenthesis, or colon to enhance readability or emphasize the conclusion of a sentence. For example, She gave him her answer - No! Whether you put spaces around the em dash or not is, again, a style choice. Just be consistent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">()</span> Brackets, Braces and Parentheses</h3>
                        <p>Brackets, braces and parentheses are symbols used to contain words that are a further explanation or are considered a group.</p>
                        <p>Parentheses ( ( ) ) are curved notations used to contain further thoughts or qualifying remarks. However, parentheses can be replaced by commas without changing the meaning in most cases.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>John and Jane (who were actually half brother and sister) both have red hair.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Brackets are the squared off notations ([ ]) used for technical explanations or to clarify meaning. If you remove the information in the brackets, the sentence will still make sense.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He [Mr. Jones] was the last person seen at the house.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Braces ( { } ) are used to contain two or more lines of text or listed items to show that they are considered as a unit. They are not commonplace in most writing, but can be seen in computer programming to show what should be contained within the same lines. They can also be used in mathematical expressions. For example, $2\{1+[23-3]\}=x$.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">''</span> Apostrophe, Quotation Marks and Ellipsis</h3>
                        <p>The final three punctuation forms in English grammar are the apostrophe, quotation marks and ellipsis. Unlike previously mentioned grammatical marks, they are not related to one another in any form.</p>
                        <p>An apostrophe (') is used to indicate the omission of a letter or letters from a word, the possessive case, or the plurals of lowercase letters.Examples of the apostrophe in use include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Omission of letters from a word: I've seen that movie several times. She wasn't the only one who knew the answer.</li>
                            <li>Possessive case: Sara's dog bit the neighbor.</li>
                            <li>Plural for lowercase letters: Six people were told to mind their p's and q's.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It should be noted that, according to Purdue University, some teachers and editors enlarge the scope of the use of apostrophe, and prefer their use on symbols (\&'s), numbers (7's) and capitalized letters (Q\&A's), even though they are not necessary.</p>
                        <p>Quotations marks (" ") are a pair of punctuation marks used primarily to mark the beginning and end of a passage attributed to another and repeated word for word. They are also used to indicate meanings and to indicate the unusual or dubious status of a word.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Don't go outside," she said.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Single quotation marks (') are used most frequently for quotes within quotes.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Marie told the teacher, "I saw Marc at the playground, and he said to me 'Bill started the fight,' and I believed him."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ellipsis is most commonly represented by three periods (. . . ) although it is occasionally demonstrated with three asterisks (***). The ellipsis is used in writing or printing to indicate an omission, especially of letters or words. Ellipses are frequently used within quotations to jump from one phrase to another, omitting unnecessary words that do not interfere with the meaning. Students writing research papers or newspapers quoting parts of speeches will often employ ellipsis to avoid copying lengthy text that is not needed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Omission of words: She began to count, "One, two, three, four ..." until she got to 10, then went to find him.</li>
                            <li>Within a quotation: When Newton stated, "An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion..." he developed the law of motion.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üíå</span> THE IMPORTANCE OF COURTESY WHEN WRITING BUSINESS LETTERS</h2>
                        <p>Whether you see your clients and customers on a regular basis or communicate with them electronically across multiple zip codes and oceans, it's critical that the content of your formal business correspondence reflects the same level of politeness and thoughtful attention to detail that would be shown if your exchange were taking place in person</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üíº</span> Professionalism</h3>
                        <p>When someone has the advantage of interacting with you in person, she can tell by your eye contact, listening skills, body language and even the way you present yourself just how seriously you take your position and your company's reputation. Because a written letter lacks the immediacy and intimacy of a real-time conversation, its overall tone calls for a sustainable level of courtesy that projects as much professionalism six months from now as it does when first read. Always consider how someone unfamiliar with the issue that prompted the correspondence will perceive you and your business.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">ü§ù</span> Respect</h3>
                        <p>A courteous business letter conveys to your recipient that you are not only sensitive to his concerns but believe in the value of taking the time to acknowledge those concerns in writing. Customer letters, in fact, often open with a phrase that personally thanks the individual and references both the date of his correspondence and the topic. According to Marceau O'Neill, author of "I Know You Know I'm Out Here!: A Contrarian's Call For Respectful Communications," something as simple as using a person's name goes a long way in letting people know that you don't just think of them as faceless blobs who are bothering you. Even if you disagree with his attitudes, opinions or decisions, courtesy is about respecting an individual's right to express himself and refusing to repay rudeness with hostility.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üéØ</span> Clarity</h3>
                        <p>Frustrations in correspondence occur when you either misinterpret what it is the correspondent really wants from you or assume a level of knowledge that the correspondent doesn't actually have. Courtesy in business letters is a combination of paraphrasing your understanding of the problem prior to addressing its solution as well as explaining policies, procedures and practices in a clear, concise way. To the customer, this communicates engagement, sincerity and a desire to inform without being arrogant or condescending, advises Andrea Geffner, author of "How to Write Better Business Letters."</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üíñ</span> Empathy</h3>
                        <p>The more you can empathize with your customers' problems, the more receptive they'll be to your response even if it's not the one they were hoping for, says Ken O'Quinn, author of "Perfect Phrases for Business Letters." Expressing your understanding, apologizing for any confusion or inconvenience, and offering remedies are considerate ways to let customers know that trying to accommodate their best interests is a company priority. A courteous demeanor in writing, versus denial and defensiveness, is particularly at the heart of taking responsibility for any wrongdoing on your part or that of the business.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üôè</span> Appreciation</h3>
                        <p>People like to know that they're appreciated. It validates their existence as human beings and affirms that even the smallest gesture has not gone unnoticed. Even if a customer expects nothing in return from you, the simple courtesy of expressing your gratitude in writing for just supporting your efforts with their patronage not only encourages ongoing loyalty but creates a chain reaction of paying kindness forward to others. Never underestimate the ripple effect of being well-mannered and polite in every form of the written word.</p>
