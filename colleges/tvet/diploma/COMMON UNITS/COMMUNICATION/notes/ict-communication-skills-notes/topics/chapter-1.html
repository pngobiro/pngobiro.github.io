                        <p><b>The exchange of information</b> or passing of information, ideas or thought from one person to the other or from one end to the other is communication. According to <b>McFarland</b> communication is, <span class="quote">"a process of meaningful interaction among human beings. More specifically, it is the process by which meanings are perceived and understandings are reached among human beings."</span> <b>Newman and Summer</b> defined communication as <span class="quote">"an exchange of facts, ideas, opinions or emotions by two or more persons."</span></p>
                        <p><b>Communication</b> is the process of passing information from one person to another. The purpose of communication is understanding of information. Whatever one wants to say to someone should be clearly understood by him else the very purpose of the communication would be defeated.</p>
                        <p>In an organisation, communication facilitates the flow of information and understanding between different people and departments through different media using all the channels and networks. This flow of information is vital for managerial effectiveness and decision making in general and for human resource manager in particular as he has to be in contact with the managers of various departments, employees and workers and trade union leaders.</p>
                        <p>Communication thus helps understand people better, removing misunderstanding and creating clarity of thoughts and expression. It also educates people. The communication may be written or oral, formal, informal, and upward, downward, horizontal, diagonal, interpersonal, intrapersonal, interdepartmental, intra-organisational.</p>
                        <p>The communication brings people together, closer to each other. The communication is an important management function closely associated with all other managerial functions. It bridges the gap between individuals and groups through flow of information and understanding between them. <b>Information is the most vital aspect for communication.</b> It is the information which is transmitted, studied, analyzed and interpreted and stored. The manager therefore has to spare time to collect, analyze and store the information for decision-making and routine day to day business.</p>
