                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üì¢</span> CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION</h2>
                        <p>In an organization, information flows forward, backwards and sideways. This information flow is referred to as communication. Communication channels refer to the way this information flows within the organization and with other organizations.</p>
                        <p>In this web known as communication, a manager becomes a link. Decisions and directions flow upwards or downwards or sideways depending on the position of the manager in the communication web.</p>
                        <p>For example, reports from lower level manager will flow upwards. A good manager has to inspire, steer and organize his employees efficiently, and for all this, the tools in his possession are spoken and written words.</p>
                        <p>For the flow of information and for a manager to handle his employees, it is important for an effectual communication channel to be in place.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚öôÔ∏è</span> The Working of a Communication Channel</h3>
                        <p>Through a modem of communication, be it face-to-face conversations or an inter-department memo, information is transmitted from a manager to a subordinate or vice versa.</p>
                        <p>An important element of the communication process is the feedback mechanism between the management and employees.</p>
                        <p>In this mechanism, employees inform managers that they have understood the task at hand while managers provide employees with comments and directions on employee's work.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">üåü</span> Importance of a Communication Channel</h3>
                        <p>A breakdown in the communication channel leads to an inefficient flow of information. Employees are unaware of what the company expects of them. They are uninformed of what is going on in the company.</p>
                        <p>This will cause them to become suspicious of motives and any changes in the company. Also without effective communication, employees become department minded rather than company minded, and this affects their decision making and productivity in the workplace.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, this harms the overall organizational objectives as well. Hence, in order for an organization to be run effectively, a good manager should be able to communicate to his/her employees what is expected of them, make sure they are fully aware of company policies and any upcoming changes.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, an effective communication channel should be implemented by managers to optimize worker productivity to ensure the smooth running of the organization.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è</span> 1. Vertical communication</h2>
                        <p>Vertical communication is the communication where information or messages flows between or among the subordinates and superiors of the organizational.</p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Stoner and his associates,"Vertical communication consists of communication up and down the organization's chain of command."</span></p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Bovee and his associates, "Vertical communication is a flow of information up and down the organization's hierarchy."</span></p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Ricky W. Griffin, "Vertical communication is the communication that flows both up and down the organization, along formal reporting lines."</span></p>
                        <p>The graphical presentation of vertical communications is as follows:</p>

                        <p>So, vertical communication is the communication where information or messages flows within the top level of the organizational structure and bottom level of the organizational structure.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚¨ÜÔ∏è</span> 2. Upwards communication</h2>
                        <p>The communication channel which pushes the flow of information upward is known as upward communication. Managers of the business organizations have to receive information continually form the levels below them to know about the progress of works. Its occurs when information flow upper the hierarchy form subordinates to superiors. Media of these types of communications are meetings, suggestions, direct letters, direct communications etc.</p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Bartol and Martin, "Upward communication is the vertical communication flows form lower level to one or more higher levels in the organization."</span></p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Ricky W. Griffin, "Upward communication consists of messages form subordinates to superior." According to Weihrich and Koontz, "Upward communication travels from subordinates to superiors and continues up the organizational hierarchy."</span></p>
                        <p><span class="quote">According to Bovee and others," Upward communication is the flow of information form lower level to higher levels in the organization."</span></p>
                        <p>The graphical presentation of upward communication is as follows:</p>

                        <p>So, upward communication is the communication where information or messages flows from the down or bottom of the organizational structure form the top of the organizational structure.</p>

                        <p>Downward communication occurs when information and messages flow down through an organization's formal chain of command or hierarchical structure. In other words, messages and orders start at the upper levels of the organizational hierarchy and move down toward the bottom levels. Responses to downward communications move up along the same path.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚ÜîÔ∏è</span> Horizontal Communication: Definition</h2>
                        <p>Horizontal communication is the transmission of information between people, divisions, departments or units within the same level of organizational hierarchy. You can distinguish it from vertical communication, which is the transmission of information between different levels of the organizational hierarchy. Horizontal communication is often referred to as 'lateral communication.'</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚úÖ</span> Advantages</h3>
                        <p>Horizontal communication presents some distinct advantages. It decreases misunderstanding between departments working on the same project, thereby increasing efficiency and productivity. It may result in better implementation of top-level decisions because employees on lower levels are permitted to coordinate directly with each other in the implementation of the decision made at the top. Horizontal communication facilitates teamwork if a project requires tasks from different people or departments. It may also increase job satisfaction and motivation by creating more employee empowerment in communication.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚ùå</span> Disadvantages</h3>
                        <p>Horizontal communication does come with some disadvantages. Management may have a greater problem maintaining control as horizontal communication increases. This is, in part, because management can derive much control and power if it controls the flow of information. Horizontal communication can also create conflict between employees exposed to each other through the communication process. It is also more timeconsuming if vertical communication is required to ratify decisions made during horizontal communication or to confirm information received through horizontal communication. Finally, it may create a lack of discipline if strict procedural rules of communications are not imposed and followed.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><span class="heading-icon">‚ÜóÔ∏è</span> Diagonal Communication</h2>
                        <p>The sharing of information among different structural levels within a business. For example, diagonal communication could involve higher level management communicating to lower level management a shift in organizational objectives, as well as the ensuing dialog about how best to achieve the new goals.</p>
                        <p>Cross-functional communication between employees at different levels of the organizational hierarchy is described as diagonal communication. Diagonal communication may overcome some of the barriers to communication within a business. It reduces the chances of distortion or misinterpretation by encouraging communication between the relevant parties. It also reduces a manager's communication workload because he doesn't have to act as an intermediary between his direct reports and other managers.</p>
