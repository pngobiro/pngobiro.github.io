<h2>Passage for Question 14</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>Fraud is the act of deceiving a person or an organization with the intention of getting financial or personal gain. It has become a very common occurrence in the world today. According to a survey conducted on online payments, millions of people are defrauded each year. Online payments are fast gaining acceptance due to speedy processing of credit cards, easy access of payment portals and immediate notifications of transactions among others. Online payments occur throughout and the fund transfer happens on immediate basis.</p>
<p>With increased access to the Internet in the world today, more people than before are using computers. These computers can be generally classified into two categories: private and public. Private computers are those that are used at home and in offices. Públic computers are found in cyber cafes, coffee shops and other public places. In addition, wireless networks are also everywhere; many of them free or available for a small fee. This availability of computers and networks makes it very easy to purchase online, check mail, chat with friends or even balance cheque books from anywhere. Using public computers to make online transactions can pose dangers. Thus caution is required since it is possible for someone to access vital information illegally. This is because one may not know what software or hardware has been installed in the public computers. Some software, for example, can capture one's username and password or other account information.</p>
<p>Regardless of the dangers posed by use of computers for online activities, various measures could be instituted to ensure fraud-free online transactions. One such measure is shunning public places and networks when making any online transactions This is because there are chances that someone may see personal information displayed on the screen Worse still, an intruder can grab sensitive information sent over the wireless network.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is need to desist from the use of public computers as such computers may have programs that can copy keystrokes as well as other software that can capture one's sensitive information, Individuals should therefore, strive to make internet transactions using private computers and networks.</p>
<p>Another measure to combat fraud is the use of credit cards instead of debit cards. This is because debit transactions are riskier than credit transactions. In debit transactions, criminals can easily drain one's bank account making it possible for them to spend the money quickly and thus thwarting any efforts to unravel the theft in time-This is unlike in a credit card theft which is less disastrous as one'd credit card company can help to dig into the matter. In addition, if one has reservations about giving out one's credit card number online, then it is advisable to use third party services such as M-Pesa thus reducing chances of such online theft.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is necessary that one's computers are securely updated with antivirus, antispyware and firewall software programs since this could also serve as deterrents to online fraud Moreover, keeping accurate records which reflect details of online transactions can be of value in combating online viee. Such records will serve as evidence of one's purchases if problems occur. Though it may be a requirement at times that one uses personal data such as date of birth and ID number, it should be noted that most legitimate websites will not ask one to give out personal information. By intercepting such information, criminals can have enough data to apply for new credit cards in the victim's name consequently being able to defraud by carrying out online transactions without being detected. Therefore, one should always be cautious not to reveal such crucial details when carrying out online transactions.</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, various measures can be instituted to ensure fraud-free online transactions. Firstly, individuals should avoid using public computers and networks for sensitive transactions due to potential security risks from unknown software and hardware (Paragraph 3 &amp; 4). Secondly, using credit cards instead of debit cards is recommended, as credit card fraud is less impactful due to company intervention (Paragraph 5). Thirdly, employing third-party payment services like M-Pesa can reduce the risk of online theft (Paragraph 5). Furthermore, it is crucial to keep computer security software updated, including antivirus and firewalls, to deter fraud (Paragraph 6). Lastly, maintaining accurate records of online transactions is valuable for evidence in case of problems and being cautious not to reveal personal data online is essential (Paragraph 6).</p>
