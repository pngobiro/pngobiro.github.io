<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Esteemed members of the board, faculty, proud parents, and my fellow graduates, today marks not an end, but a commencement – the beginning of our journey into the vast world of opportunities. As we celebrate this milestone at Miwanaisha Technical College, I am honored to speak on a topic close to the heart of innovation and progress: "The Benefits of Being Self-Employed."</p>
<p>Self-employment, the path of entrepreneurship, offers unparalleled autonomy. It empowers us to be our own captains, charting our course and making decisions aligned with our vision. We gain control over our time, our projects, and our professional destiny. This freedom fosters creativity and allows us to pursue passions that ignite our entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>Moreover, self-employment cultivates resilience and resourcefulness. It demands we wear multiple hats, learning diverse skills from marketing to finance, becoming versatile problem-solvers. This hands-on experience provides a practical education beyond textbooks, preparing us for the dynamic challenges of the modern economy.</p>
<p>The financial rewards of self-employment are directly proportional to our efforts and ingenuity. Unlike fixed salaries, our income potential is limitless, driven by our innovation and market demand. This prospect motivates us to strive for excellence and continuously adapt to evolving market needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, self-employment contributes to societal growth by creating jobs and driving economic innovation. As entrepreneurs, we are not just job seekers but job creators, fostering prosperity and contributing to the nation's development. In conclusion, embracing self-employment is embracing freedom, resilience, and limitless potential, a path ripe with opportunity for us, the graduating class of Miwanaisha Technical College, to shape our futures and contribute meaningfully to the world.</p>

<h2>Passage</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>The Economic growth rate in Kenya for the year 2011-2012 could range between five and six per cent if no major shocks occur. However, the private sector has predicted that the successful completion of infrastructure and energy projects could see the economy grow at seven per cent during this period. According to the World Bank's Report on the Economic Prospects for Kenya, the seven per cent growth projected by the private sector is likely to depend on a number of factors.</p>
<p>To begin with are infrastructure projects that are likely to bring change in the economy. These include the construction of road and rail systems, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the construction of geothermal energy plants. Transport and communication, energy and the cost of fuel are major implements of doing business. The infrastructure projects are an effort to address the three economic impediments and their successful completion could be a turning point for the Kenyan economy.</p>
<p>The successful construction of a number of roads is likely to speed up growth in the agriculture, horticulture and tourism sectors. This may significantly improve the economic performance from the predicted six per cent to seven per cent. The completion of a number of roads already under construction could make the country more attractive to investors and the cost of doing business is likely to go down. Some of the roads under construction include the Namanga-Athi River Road, Mombasa Road, Forest Road and Thika Road. Kenya's economic growth will also depend on investment in the geothermal energy projects earmarked for completion by 2015.</p>
<p>Another key driver for change in the country's economy is the ICT sector. It has been the main driver of Kenya's economic growth over the last decade. The sector has been growing on average by 20 per cent annually and has propelled the combined transport and communication sector into the economy's second largest after agriculture. Over the last three decades Kenya has experienced only two short episodes when economic growth exceeded five per cent and was sustained for at least three consecutive years: 1986 to 1988 and 2004 to 2007. The World Bank Report on Economic Prospects for Kenya indicates that since 2000, Kenya's economy grew at an average of four per cent. Without ICT, growth in 2010 would have been about three percent which is similar to the population growth rate. This would have meant that the income per capita would have stagnated.</p>
<p>While the public sector investments in infrastructure will help stimulate growth, the timely implementation of the constitution reforms would boost business confidence. Much of what is expected to be achieved will depend on how the country implements the constitution and how the country behaves politically in relation to the 2012 elections. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) and the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) say that the implementation of the constitution will in essence reduce the country's political risk, while at the same time reassuring foreign and domestic investors that Kenya is a safe investment haven. Putting in place a new constitution cannot be entirely seen as a panacea to eradicating the country's political risk associated with each election year. However, this will assure investors thus reducing the capital flight and the slow-down of foreign direct investment experienced during general elections. Another factor that is expected to have a major impact on the country's economic growth, although negatively, is an increase in oil prices. Indeed, it has been indicated that this year might once again witness a return of runaway crude oil prices. This would be driven by increased global demand, a push for higher prices by oil producing nations, the return of speculators and increased tension in the Middle East. Several analysts have already predicted that oil prices could surpass the $100 per barrel mark. Although the government has so far introduced price controls in the local market to contain the uncontrolled increment of local prices by oil marketers, a surge in global prices will definitely not spare the country.</p>
<p>The East African Community (EAC) economic bloc might welcome a new member state, Southern Sudan, when the area separates from the control of the Khartoum government after the referendum. Southern Sudanese leaders have already expressed interest to join the EAC bloc. Admission of an additional state will translate to increased investment opportunities for Kenya which is the strongest economy in the bloc. In addition, this year could see the signing of a comprehensive protocol that will define trade between the EAC and the European Union. Hence, the long running negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements could finally come to a close.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>In about 150 words and according to the passage, explain the factors that are likely to influence Kenya's economic growth rate during the period under review.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, Kenya's economic growth rate for 2011-2012 is influenced by several key factors. Infrastructure projects, including roads, rail, ICT, and geothermal energy plants, are crucial for driving economic change by addressing economic impediments and improving business operations (Paragraph 2). Successful completion of road construction is expected to boost agriculture, horticulture, and tourism, potentially increasing economic performance from six to seven percent (Paragraph 3). The ICT sector is also highlighted as a major driver, having propelled economic growth over the past decade (Paragraph 4). Furthermore, the implementation of constitutional reforms is expected to boost business confidence and reduce political risk, attracting both foreign and domestic investment (Paragraph 5). Conversely, rising global oil prices are identified as a negative factor that could hinder economic growth, despite government price controls (Paragraph 5). Lastly, the potential admission of Southern Sudan into the EAC and trade agreements with the EU could create increased investment opportunities, positively influencing Kenya’s growth as the strongest economy in the bloc (Paragraph 6). These factors collectively shape Kenya's economic outlook for the period.</p>
