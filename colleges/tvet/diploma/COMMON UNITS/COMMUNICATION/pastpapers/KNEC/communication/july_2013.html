<h2>Passage</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>It is often hard to understand why companies care when the prices of their shares fall. After all, listed companies have already received money from investors when they first sold shares through an initial public offering. What happens in the secondary market when investors buy and sell to each other at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) cannot take away the gains the company has already made. However, like with most things, the story is a lot more complex than it appears.</p>
<p>To begin with, most senior managers generally have a vested interest in the company. Similarly, the founder-members of many public companies own a significant number of shares. Hence, their personal wealth could be dramatically affected by a fall in the company's share price. Besides, many employees receive performance-related bonuses in the form of shares in their company. This effectively means that they are stockholders of the company and therefore pay strong attention to its share price. Additionally a falling share price can impact on the reputation of a company and therefore reflect negatively on its management. It is also not unusual for the management of a company to have salary incentives or employee stock options tied to the company's share prices.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies which are underperforming also often become takeover targets. If the share price of a company falls substantially, it makes it much easier and much more affordable for a rival company to move in and buy up a significant amount of stock or launch a takeover bid that shareholders cannot afford to refuse. This is a very big incentive for companies to ensure their stock remains relatively stable so that they remain strong and deter interested parties from forcing them into a takeover ueal. In addition, the rate and ease at which companies borrow money can be affected by a falling share price. In most cases, creditors tend to look favourably upon companies which are performing well and may offer them cheaper financing through a lower interest rate.</p>
<p>If the performance of a company's shares is ignored, it can have serious repercussions on the fate of the firm and its management. Share price is often an indicator of a company's financial health and can influence analysts' and lenders' evaluations. Hence stock performance directly affects a company's borrowing power, which has a significant effect on its financial health. However, share price is a poor method of evaluating a company's performance because it has more to do with emotion and perception than whether a company is taking care of the business.</p>
<p>Although a manager has little or no control of share price in the short run, poor share performance could, over the long run, be attributed to mismanagement of the company. If the share price consistently underperforms, the shareholders would be unhappy with the management and look for changes. While the extent to which shareholders can control management is debatable, executives must always factor in the desires of shareholders since these shareholders are part owners of the company. Companies would want their share prices to remain relatively stable so that they remain strong and deter interested companies from taking them over. On the other side of the takeover equation, a company with a hot stock has a great advantage when seeking to buy other companies. Instead of having to either use the retained earnings or borrow money, a company will simply issue more shares through a rights issue to fund the takeover.</p>
<p>Moreover, a company may want to increase its share price simply to increase its prestige and exposure to the public. The larger the market capitalization of a company, the more analyst coverage the company will receive. Such analyst coverage is a form of free advertising and allows both senior managers and the company itself to introduce themselves to a wider audience. Thus the share price at the stock market is very closely watched by managers and shareholders because it acts as a barometer for a company's prospects and fortunes.</p>

<h3>14. (a) (12 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>In about 150 words and according to the passage, explain why companies get concerned when the price of their shares fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, companies are concerned about falling share prices for several interconnected reasons. Firstly, senior managers and founder-members often hold significant shares, so a price drop directly diminishes their personal wealth (Paragraph 2). Secondly, many employees receive share-based bonuses, making them stockholders sensitive to price fluctuations, impacting morale and potentially performance (Paragraph 2). Thirdly, a falling share price can damage a company's reputation, reflecting negatively on its management and future prospects (Paragraph 2). Furthermore, underperforming companies with low share prices become vulnerable to takeovers, as rival firms find it easier and cheaper to acquire a controlling stake, threatening the company's independence (Paragraph 3). Lower share prices also increase borrowing costs, as creditors view such companies as riskier, affecting financial health (Paragraph 3). Finally, companies seek to maintain or increase share price for prestige and public exposure, as higher market capitalization attracts analyst coverage, which acts as free advertising and enhances visibility to wider audiences (Paragraph 6). Therefore, share price is a critical barometer of a company's perceived health and future, influencing various stakeholders and strategic options.</p>

<h3>14. (b) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>State the meaning of the following words and phrases as used in the passage.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>**(i) take away the gains:**</p>
<p>In the context of the passage, "take away the gains" means to negate or nullify the profits or benefits a company has already accumulated. The passage states that secondary market trading "cannot take away the gains the company has already made," meaning past profits are secured regardless of share price fluctuations in the secondary market.</p>
<p>**(ii) impact on:**</p>
<p>"Impact on" means to have an effect or influence on something. The passage mentions that a falling share price can "impact on the reputation of a company," indicating that share price decline can negatively affect the company's public image and standing.</p>
<p>**(iii) substantially:**</p>
<p>"Substantially" means to a large extent or significantly. When the passage says, "If the share price of a company falls substantially," it refers to a significant or considerable decrease in the company's share price.</p>
<p>**(iv) indicator:**</p>
<p>"Indicator" refers to something that serves as a sign or measure of something else. Share price is described as "often an indicator of a company's financial health," meaning it is used as a gauge or signal of the company's financial condition.</p>
<p>**(v) relatively stable:**</p>
<p>"Relatively stable" means reasonably steady or not subject to significant fluctuations. Companies want their stock to remain "relatively stable" to avoid takeover threats and maintain investor confidence, implying they aim for a share price that does not vary dramatically.</p>
<p>**(vi) prestige:**</p>
<p>"Prestige" refers to high standing or reputation achieved through success or influence. Companies may want to increase share price to enhance their "prestige," indicating that a higher share price contributes to a company's esteemed public image and market perception.</p>
