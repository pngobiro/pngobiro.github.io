<div class="question-content">
<p>In about 250 words, write an essay on: "The Benefits of Improved Road Networks to the Kenyan Economy".</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Improved road networks are critical infrastructure for Kenya's economic development, offering multifaceted benefits that stimulate growth across various sectors. Firstly, enhanced road infrastructure significantly boosts trade and commerce by facilitating faster and more efficient transportation of goods. Reduced travel times and lower transportation costs enable businesses to access wider markets, both domestically and regionally, fostering increased trade volumes and economic activity. This improved connectivity is particularly vital for agricultural sectors, allowing farmers to transport perishable goods to markets promptly, minimizing post-harvest losses and enhancing food security.</p>
<p>Secondly, better roads are essential for tourism, a key revenue earner for Kenya. Accessible and well-maintained roads enable tourists to reach diverse attractions, including national parks, coastal resorts, and cultural sites, more comfortably and safely. This enhanced accessibility expands tourism circuits, encourages repeat visits, and supports the growth of tourism-related businesses such as hotels, tour operators, and local crafts. Furthermore, improved infrastructure enhances Kenya's attractiveness as a regional tourism hub, attracting international visitors and boosting foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>Thirdly, investments in road infrastructure create employment opportunities, both directly in construction and maintenance and indirectly in sectors that benefit from improved connectivity. Construction projects generate jobs for engineers, laborers, and support staff, while improved transportation networks stimulate business expansion, leading to further job creation in manufacturing, retail, and services. Moreover, better roads improve access to education and healthcare, particularly in rural areas, enhancing human capital development and overall quality of life, which are fundamental for sustained economic progress. In conclusion, improved road networks are a catalyst for economic growth in Kenya, driving trade, tourism, employment, and overall socio-economic development.</p>

<h2>Passage</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>Kenya could be losing billions of shillings annually as the repatriation of profits from the local tourism sector by multinational firms hits a record high. According to economic and tourism analysts, financial leakages from the industry could now be among the highest in the world as foreign tour operators devise self-serving modes of operation. This fear comes against a backdrop of an ever-rising domination of the lucrative industry by the trans-national players, most of whom are believed to be exploiting weak government policies to scoop maximum profits.</p>
<p>Financial leakages in tourism occur when revenues arising from tourism-related economic activities in destination countries are not available for re-investment or consumption of goods and services in the same countries. Financial resources "leak away" from the destination country to another country. particularly when the tourism company is based abroad and when tourism-related goods and services are being imported to the destination country.</p>
<p>Experts advise that while Kenya raised Ksh73.7 billions from tourism in 2010, the revenue could be tripled if loopholes that have facilitated unrestrained repatriation of profits are sealed. Financial leakages have over past decades affected diverse economic sectors in Kenya and many other developing countries. However, the analysts pinpoint the sudden increase in all-inclusive holiday packages to Kenya and transfer pricing as the main factors behind the escalating leakage levels in the tourism industry. The Kenya Association of Tour Operators membership list shows that up to 90 per cent of the 37 Category A and B tour firms in the country are owned and mostly managed by non-Kenyans. In contrast, Kenyans mainly run companies in categories D and E. Nearly all four and five star accommodation facilities in the country are also part of international chains headquartered overseas. The same applies to majority of airline owners in the country. As a result, Kenya could be getting as little as 20 per cent of the total revenue generated from her tourism.</p>
<p>Most of the foreign-owned tour companies are now predominantly offering all-inclusive tour packages in deals that make tourists pay for all their expenses to to the the f firms' agents abroad. These deals have reduced the revenue that Kenya, as a destination country, gets from the sector. The deals have further locked local tour firms out of subcontracts in the sector. Some of the Some of the companies are quite financially stable, such that they now own or are hiring private chartered planes and cruise ships that transport clients directly to and from Kenya. With Kenya being a long-haul destination where flights normally constitute about 40 to 50 per cent of the total package cost, half the total sum paid is thus lost even before tourists enter the country. This would be a different scenario if the tourists primarily relied on Kenyan airlines. Further, unlike in the past when foreign firms used to subcontract destination travel services to locals, most of them no longer outsource these services. They now own diverse fleets of vehicles to cater for safaris and transfers.</p>
<p>The package tours have also made it unnecessary for tourists to spend money outside the hotels and lodges. Most of the tourists now come to Kenya with petty cash to spend on tips, souvenirs and emergencies. Some European families pay up to Ksh2 million for a package tour as part of the initial quotation but only spend less than Ksh300,000 in Kenya. There are cases where some of the tour firms pay Maasai households as little as Ksh300 per night to have tourists spend nights in their manyattas when the guests have paid up to Ksh20,000 each for accommodation daily. There is also a sudden increase in the number of foreigners evading taxation. This is done by hosting tourists in cottages and villas at the coast by accommodating them as friends and relatives, thereby denying the economy a lot of money.</p>
<p>In essence, many local tour operators cannot compete with the financial strength, marketing and logistics of internationally operating tourism companies based in developed countries. This is why some international firms serve thousands of guests all year round while Kenyan firms only do business during the high season.</p>

<h3>14. (a) (12 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>In about 150 words, and according to the passage, explain why Kenya is not enjoying the full benefits of the tourism revenue.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, Kenya is not fully benefiting from tourism revenue due to significant financial leakages. These leakages occur when revenues generated from tourism activities are not reinvested or consumed within Kenya but are instead transferred out of the country. This is primarily attributed to multinational tourism firms dominating the sector, employing "self-serving modes of operation" to maximize profits, often exploiting weak government policies (Paragraph 1). The passage highlights all-inclusive holiday packages and transfer pricing as key mechanisms for these leakages (Paragraph 3). These packages ensure tourists pay most expenses to foreign agents, minimizing spending within Kenya. Furthermore, a large portion of tour firms and high-end accommodation are foreign-owned, leading to profit repatriation (Paragraph 3). Local Kenyan firms, mainly in lower categories, and Kenyan-owned airlines are underutilized. Consequently, despite Kenya generating substantial tourism revenue, a disproportionately small percentage, potentially as low as 20%, remains within the country (Paragraph 3), hindering its economic benefits.</p>
