<h2>Passage for Question 14</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>A high number of matatu crews still use cash despite the expiry of the 1 December 2014 deadline for public transport to use cashless methods in payment of fare. Apparently, the matatu owners are unmoved by the stipulated Ksh. 100,000 fine against those who fail to change to the new system.</p>
<p>Opinion is still divided among the public on the new method of payment with some embracing while others seem reluctant to adopt it. The world's financial markets, however, are going cashless and Kenya has no choice but to follow suit. Experts say that digital payments will bring a lot of benefits. Since Kenya leads in the use of mobile money services in the region, going cashless in all aspects of the economy is inevitable.</p>
<p>The CEO and founder of Tangazoletu Limited, a firm that automates business processes and provides mobile financial products, says that the journey to digital payments has just started. "As much as cash has been the universal language, Kenyans need to be prepared to adopt a cashless system that is beneficial to the consumers, corporates and the government who are basically the key drivers of the economy. We are very innovative, and as long as we take gradual steps, the move to a cashless system is possible," he said.</p>
<p>A research conducted by Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Kenya in mid-2012 showed that electronic payments cost between 50 and 65 per cent less than paper payments. This would translate to over Ksh. 90 billion annually in savings for Kenya. The figure is arrived at using the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for 2013 revised in September 2014 from Ksh. 3.8 trillion to Ksh. 4.76 trillion.</p>
<p>The figures underline the fact that cash payments are expensive. Even withdrawing cash in banks has a cost involved. The FSD survey showed that on average, people spend between 20 and 80 minutes to carry out banking services involving cash in Kenya's urban areas. Rural folks spend even more time travelling to carry out banking transactions.</p>
<p>Proponents of a cashless system point out various problems encountered when dealing with cash. First and foremost, carrying cash is dangerous as one is vulnerable to theft. People handling cash are left counting more losses than those with cards or mobile money in case of a robbery. In addition, transporting large surns of money is always a tense affair despite the armed escort. It is also costly because the transporters have to be paid. The money further requires to be insured against risks such as robberies.</p>
<p>Another problem is that cash is susceptible to fire and con men unlike a card which, even if destroyed or lost, the money remains safe somewhere. Besides, one can fall prey to con artists who peddle fake currencies. A cash system makes it hard for the tax man to curb tax evasion unlike a cashless system which is easier to trace.</p>
<p>FSD also found out that most Kenyans easily engage in impulse buying when they have cash. Electronic payments instil some level of discipline because the act of having to withdraw cash forces one to think about what one needs to buy. Further, it is harder for consumers to control and track their expenditure when using cash as opposed to dealing with a cashless system.</p>
<p>According to Central Bank estimates as at August 2014, more than 26 million Kenyans have adopted mobile money in purchasing, transfer and banking. The Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) puts the number of mobile subscribers at 31.8 million, 80 per cent of whom use mobile money services. The figure is likely to rise as Equity Bank has rolled out its own Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) platform. Under the system, the bank's customers will use their handsets to transfer cash and buy goods using the money in their accounts. Globally, the financial market has shifted tremendously in the past three decades with the use of the cashless system rapidly increasing. People have turned to easier ways of transacting business especially with the introduction of mobile money.</p>

<p>In about 120 words, and according to the passage, explain the various problems encountered when dealing with cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, dealing with cash presents several problems. Firstly, it is dangerous due to vulnerability to theft, making handlers susceptible to robbery and financial losses (Paragraph 6). Secondly, transporting large amounts of cash is risky and costly, requiring armed escorts and insurance (Paragraph 6). Cash is also susceptible to fire and counterfeiting, unlike digital money (Paragraph 7). Furthermore, cash transactions complicate tax collection and facilitate tax evasion (Paragraph 7). Impulse buying is more prevalent with cash, as electronic payments encourage more conscious spending habits (Paragraph 8). Finally, tracking and controlling expenditure is harder with cash compared to cashless systems (Paragraph 8).</p>
