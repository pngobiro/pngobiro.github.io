<h3>12. (a) (8 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain four challenges of using e-mail as a means of communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">**Information Overload:** The sheer volume of emails received daily can lead to information overload, causing important messages to be overlooked or missed amidst the clutter. This reduces communication effectiveness and can delay responses to critical issues.</p>
<p data-number="2">**Misinterpretation of Tone:** Email lacks non-verbal cues such as tone of voice and body language, making it difficult to convey emotions and intentions accurately. This can easily lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings, potentially causing conflict or damaging relationships.</p>
<p data-number="3">**Security Risks:** Emails are vulnerable to security threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Sensitive information transmitted via email can be intercepted, leading to privacy violations and potential financial or reputational damage for individuals and organizations.</p>
<p data-number="4">**Impersonal Communication:** Email communication can feel impersonal and less engaging compared to face-to-face or phone conversations. This can hinder the development of strong interpersonal relationships and reduce the sense of connection and collaboration within teams or organizations.</p>

<h3>12. (b) (10 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain five factors that may make a meeting fail to achieve its objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">**Lack of Clear Objectives:** Meetings without clearly defined objectives lack direction and focus. Participants may be unsure of the meeting's purpose, leading to unfocused discussions and failure to achieve desired outcomes. A well-defined objective is crucial for meeting success.</p>
<p data-number="2">**Poor Agenda Management:** A poorly structured or non-existent agenda results in disorganized meetings. Without a clear agenda, discussions can drift off-topic, time may be wasted on irrelevant issues, and key items may be overlooked, preventing objective attainment.</p>
<p data-number="3">**Ineffective Facilitation:** Weak meeting facilitation can derail progress. If the facilitator fails to manage discussions, control dominant personalities, or encourage participation from all attendees, the meeting can become unproductive and fail to reach its intended goals.</p>
<p data-number="4">**Lack of Follow-Up Actions:** Meetings often fail when agreed-upon actions are not documented and followed up on. Without clear action items, assigned responsibilities, and deadlines, decisions made during the meeting may not be implemented, rendering the meeting ineffective in achieving its objectives.</p>
<p data-number="5">**Dominant Participants:** When a few participants dominate the discussion, it stifles contributions from others and limits diverse perspectives. This imbalance can lead to decisions that are not well-rounded or fully considered, hindering the meeting's ability to achieve comprehensive and effective outcomes.</p>

<h2>Passage</h2>
<div class="passage-content">
<p>The housing sector in Kenya faces a number of challenges. In deed, owning a house remains a dream of many. There is a high demand for formal housing which has fuelled price hikes hence locking out potential buyers. This has, in turn, denied the housing sector much needed funds to- re-invest in order to increase the supply which has resulted in low supply of affordable houses. Real estate analysts and economists are warning that house prices will continue to rise as lenders shy away from the business.</p>
<p>A report by the African Development Bank (AfDB) shows that high prices have locked Kenya's housing sector out of fast growth. The AfDB is warning of a worsening supply gap because only a handful of private developers in the country can afford to invest in medium to large scale developments that target the middle to low income earners. According to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa, the annual increase in the demand for housing in Kenya is 206,000 units. The inability of private developers to execute well-done projects at a reasonable cost is becoming a big concern not only in Kenya, but the entire East African region. With the exception of Zambia and to some extent Tanzania, AfDB claims that many regional developers lack experience. In Kenya there are only a few developers who have an average of 5.5 years of experience and are able to put up large developments of 200 and 250 units at a time.</p>
<p>According to data from the Central Bank of Kenya, the average size of a home loan in Kenya has been rising at the rate of about 15 per cent per year. This means that a home loan that was Ksh 5 million in one year would rise to Ksh 5.75 million the following year. The lack of innovative financing options and high interest on mortgages makes affordability of houses a challenge. A research economist at the AfDB found out that interest rates on home loans range between 11 and 25 per cent per year. This means that a borrower of Ksh 6.4 million for a 15-year house loan at an interest rate of 18 per cent per year will end up paying Ksh 17.3 million. While currently about 80 per cent of new houses target high and upper middle income earners, the AfDB report shows that the greatest demand – estimated at 83 per cent – is among the middle and low income earners.</p>
<p>, According to property firm Hass Consult, this state of affairs means that 80 per cent of Kenyans living in urban areas do not live in their own houses. Another challenge is that these urban dwellers who live in rented houses have to contend with fast rising rent hence hindering their potential to save and buy a house of their own. Since 2001, rent in major urban centres has increased by about 300 per cent. For example, a house that was being rented for Ksh 10,000 in 2001 cost about Ksh 30,000 per month in 2013. The lack of innovative mortgage financing solutions is a further challenge. This is because even companies that specialize in developing cheaper houses require their clients to source for financing independently. There is also lack of government support in Kenya especially in the development of infrastructure such as road networks, water and sanitation without which the projects become unattractive to buyers. The market estimates that the cost of privately developed infrastructure adds another 20-30 per cent to the price of houses in Kenya.</p>
<p>The problems facing the Kenya housing sector are multi-dimensional and require a holistic approach if the majority of urban dwellers are to afford houses. The market needs to be educated to accept different building solutions that are more cost effective such as prefabricated houses. Such houses are cheaper and can reduce construction time by up to 50 per cent and the cost of construction by more than 30 per cent.</p>

<h3>14. (a) (12 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>In about 150 words and according to the passage, explain the challenges facing the housing sector in Kenya.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>According to the passage, the Kenyan housing sector faces significant challenges primarily driven by high demand and limited supply of affordable housing. The passage highlights that "owning a house remains a dream of many" due to "high demand for formal housing which has fuelled price hikes" (Paragraph 1). This price inflation locks out potential buyers and reduces funds for reinvestment, further exacerbating the supply shortage. The African Development Bank (AfDB) report cited in the passage emphasizes a "worsening supply gap" because only "a handful of private developers…can afford to invest in medium to large scale developments" (Paragraph 2). Additionally, rising interest rates on home loans, ranging from 11% to 25% annually, combined with limited "innovative financing options" (Paragraph 3 &amp; 4), make affordability a major obstacle. The passage also notes that "80 per cent of Kenyans living in urban areas do not live in their own houses" (Paragraph 4), indicating a severe housing deficit. Furthermore, rapidly increasing rents, which have risen by "about 300 per cent" since 2001 (Paragraph 4), hinder saving capacity for home purchase. The lack of government support for infrastructure development, as mentioned in paragraph 4, adds to the cost and unattractiveness of housing projects, compounding these challenges. In conclusion, the passage portrays a housing sector struggling with affordability, supply constraints, and financial barriers.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain the meaning of the following words and phrases as used in the passage.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>**(i) lenders:**</p>
<p>In the context of the passage, "lenders" refers to financial institutions, primarily banks and mortgage providers, that offer loans to individuals or developers for housing purposes. The passage mentions that "house prices will continue to rise as lenders shy away from the business," indicating that reduced lending activity contributes to the housing crisis.</p>
<p>**(ii) handful:**</p>
<p>"Handful" is used to describe the limited number of private developers in Kenya capable of undertaking large-scale housing projects. The AfDB report states "only a handful of private developers in the country can afford to invest in medium to large scale developments," highlighting the scarcity of developers with sufficient capacity and resources.</p>
<p>**(iii) put up:**</p>
<p>"Put up" in the phrase "able to put up large developments" means to construct or build. The passage indicates that only a few developers in Kenya "are able to put up large developments of 200 and 250 units at a time," emphasizing the limited construction capacity for large housing projects.</p>
<p>**(iv) innovative:**</p>
<p>"Innovative" describes the need for new and creative approaches to mortgage financing. The passage mentions "lack of innovative mortgage financing solutions" as a further challenge, suggesting that traditional mortgage products are insufficient and there is a need for more creative and accessible financial instruments to improve housing affordability.</p>
<p>**(v) hindering:**</p>
<p>"Hindering" means impeding or obstructing progress. The passage states that rising rents are "hindering their potential to save and buy a house of their own," meaning that escalating rental costs are preventing urban dwellers from accumulating savings necessary for homeownership.</p>
<p>**(vi) cost effective:**</p>
<p>"Cost effective" refers to solutions that are economical and provide good value for money. The passage suggests educating the market to accept "more cost effective…prefabricated houses," indicating that prefabricated housing is presented as a more affordable alternative to traditional construction methods.</p>
