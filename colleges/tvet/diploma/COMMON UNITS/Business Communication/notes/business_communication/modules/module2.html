        <h2>üìö Lesson Three: Barriers to Business Communication</h2>
        <p>In order for effective business communication to place, there must be a mutual understanding between the sender and the receiver, it follows, therefore, that every effort he made to eliminate or at least reduce any factors that can reduce effectiveness of the business communication. Managers can begin by being aware of the factors that might disrupt business communication and how to deal with them.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>Barriers to business communication are factors that can impair effectiveness of business transactions in an organization. they prevent, block or interrupt mutual understanding. Some barriers arise from interpersonal (person-to-person) business communications. Other factors are unique to organizational structures. A manager's business environment comprises face-to-face business communication.</p>

            <h3>Organizational Communication Barriers</h3>
                <p>Barriers to organizational communication are those factors that impair the quality of business communication because of the nature of organizations. Such factors vary from organization to organization. However, some of the factors, as the ones listed below, are common to many organizations:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Filtering</li>
                  <li>Span of control</li>
                  <li>The rank in organization</li>
                  <li>Change in manager</li>
                  <li>Manager's interpretation information overload</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Filtering:</strong> This situation occurs when a sender purposely manipulates information to make it seem more favorably by the receiver. For example, when an employee tells his or her boss what he or she thinks the boss wants to hear the employee is filtering information. The number of levels in an organization's structure usually influences filtering. The more vertical levels of the organization's hierarchy, the more opportunities there are for filtering. The screening of' information as it flows upwards and downwards, intentionally, or accidentally, can cause a barrier.</p>
                <p><strong>Span of control:</strong> The number of people a manger supervises can cause a barrier through limited business communication. The fewer the number supervised, the more effective the business communication and accurate the information flow, and vice versa. The number of employees supervised, thus, influences the level of business communication control.</p>
                <p><strong>The rank in organization:</strong> A natural inhibition of business communication can result, for example, when a managing director asks a receptionist to be open and honest about how the company is operating- In this case, communication barrier may arise from an anxiety and a sense of intimidation on the part of the junior employee.</p>
                <p><strong>Change in manager:</strong> When managers change positions, management style also changes. Consequently, a change in style and philosophy in business communication is most likely to occur. A manager may choose to be actively involved in all business communication, screen and hold information tightly, prefer face-to-face business communication, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Manager's interpretation:</strong> Managers may he influenced by selective interpretation of events, depending on their positions in the organization. The perspective of a manager, whether as a resource distributor or resource recipient, can influence a manger's perception of what is happening and what is communicated, to whom it is communicated, and when it is communicated</p>
                <p><strong>Information overload:</strong> Individuals have a finite capacity for processing data. When the information we have to work with exceeds our processing capacity, the result is information overload. The employees in general and managers in particular, often get overwhelmed with information.</p>
                  <p>Advanced communication technologies such as e-mails, cell phones, faxes, meetings, and the need to keep current in one's field, the potential for today's managers and professionals to suffer from information is high. When individuals have more information than they can sort out and use, they tend to select, ignore, pass over or forget information. They may also put off any further processing until the overload situation is over. In any case, the consequence is lost information and less effective communication.</p>

            <h3>Barriers to Interpersonal Business Communication</h3>
              <p>Several barriers exist between the sender and receiver that may make business communication ineffective. Some of such barriers to interpersonal or face-to-face communication are listed below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hearing what we expect to hear</li>
                    <li>Ignoring information that conflicts with what we know</li>
                    <li>Evaluating the source Differing perceptions</li>
                    <li>Multiple meaning of words</li>
                    <li>Conflicting symbols</li>
                    <li>Language</li>
                    <li>Listening</li>
                    <li>Stereotype</li>
                    <li>Lack of feedback</li>
                    <li>Emotional response</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These types of barriers can make it difficult for mutual understanding to exist between the sender and the receiver in a business transaction. Below is a brief description of each type.</p>
                <p><strong>Hearing what we expect to hear:</strong> This type of barrier occurs when the sender is tuned off the speaker, by the sender who feels overly confident about what the sender wanted to say. There are people who either consciously or subconsciously ‚Äòsnatch ‚Äòwords from the sender mouth and completing the sender's statement. This kind of behavior usually causes harrier between the sender and the receiver.</p>
                <p><strong>Ignoring information that conflicts with what we 'know':</strong> We reluctantly accept without questioning what we ‚Äòknow' is obvious. For example, we ‚Äòknow' school fees must be paid; we 'know' examinations must be done at the end of each semester or academic term; we 'know' Christmas falls on December. If someone tries to tell us something which sounds contrary to what we 'knows the information will most likely be blocked out, limiting business communication.</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluating the source:</strong> This type of barrier occurs when the sender's credibility is questionable. How readily we accept the meaning and value of a message depends on our evaluation of the source of the message. The more credible the sender is, the more his/her message is received, and vice versa. For example, a new employee in organization receiving information about the organization, from a fellow old employee, will attach more value to the information than if the same information is given by a fellow new employee.</p>
                <p><strong>Differing perception:</strong> All of us come from different social or cultural backgrounds. Consequently, we all have a different set of experiences, values, and beliefs. Therefore, we have different perceptions of our environment. These perceptual differences colour on communications.</p>
                  <p>Our sense of urgency may vary with our cultural backgrounds, such that 'immediacy', for example, can mean in the next few seconds, within the day, or when you get time, depending on your perception or the message.</p>
                <p><strong>Multiple meaning of words:</strong> For business communication to be effective, both the sender and the receiver must attach the same meaning to word. Words are symbols used in business communication and their meanings may vary. Consider the following words: lead, tin, discipline, fix, etc. These kinds of words have different meanings at different situations. Caution should be taken to ensure that both the sender and the receiver attribute the same symbolic meaning to a word. Even if we are communicating in the same language, words mean different things to different people. Age and context are two of the biggest factors that influence the language a person uses and definitions he or she gives to words. Effective communication will occur only to the extent that the source makes good choices when creating messages.</p>
                <p><strong>Conflicting non-verbal signals:</strong> Body language can often enhance the quality of business communication. The non-verbal signals such as facial expressions, gestures, movement, nodding head, etc, can provide feedback where verbal business communication is concerned. Mixed messages result when a person's words communicate one message while their actions or ‚Äúbody language" communicate something else.</p>
                <p><strong>Language:</strong> how you use words may affect quality of business communication. Many words have different meanings. Proper understanding of meaning and correct choice of words must be given critical consideration in order to attain effective communication. Foreign languages, dialects, tribal or regional accents and the use of technical secialist language should always be considered.</p>
                <p><strong>Listening:</strong> Listening is a skill, which can be acquired with training. Good listeners are generally effective communicators. Sufficient concentration should exist for listening to take place in an effective business communication. Lack of listening can seriously damage business transaction. Many business transactions require good listening skills. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A co-worker in your department asks you a question, or seeks your advice to complete a task.</li>
                  <li>You receive spoken instructions from your supervisor.</li>
                  <li>You attend and participate in staff meetings, seminars or workshops.</li>
                  <li>You answer telephone and take accurate phone messages.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>How much one can listen often depends on certain indictors such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>words used</li>
                  <li>the way business communication is expressed</li>
                  <li>interest in the speaker</li>
                  <li>interest in the subject and business communication, etc</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Stereotype:</strong> Sometimes people hold stereotypes that everyone in a particular group acts the same way. Such stereotypes often give negative, inaccurate, and shallow thinking. For example, some people may say that all politicians are liars. Alternatively, they may assert that women are qualified only for certain jobs in an organization. Alternatively, they may perceive individuals with some kind of impairment as helpless. Effective communication is most unlikely to take place under such circumstances. We can overcome stereotype tendencies by being more sensitive to others and ourselves.</p>
                <p><strong>Emotional responses:</strong> Business communication is likely to be ineffective in a charged atmosphere, where the speaker or receiver is emotional about the topic concerned. It would be advisable to put communication off until emotions cool down. How the receiver feels at the time of receiving communication influences how he or she interprets the message. For example, an angry customer being explained why he or she could not be given a refund for a damaged item, will most likely interpret the message differently than it is when he or she is happy. Extreme emotions such as jubilation or depression are most likely to hinder effective communication. In such situations, we are most prone to disregard our rational and objective thinking process and substitute emotional judgments.</p>
                <p><strong>Lack of feedback:</strong> Feedback is the continuous process though which mutual understanding of a message is determined. You apply feedback by watching facial expressions or body language. You also apply feedback by asking certain questions to discover if a receiver actually understood your message. Feedback helps to prevent communication breakdown because it provides a clue as to what further communication might be necessary. Effective communication is a two-way process, which requires a feedback mechanism into the communication process</p>

            <h2>üìö Lesson Four: Oral Business Communication</h2>
            <p>Oral communication is perhaps the most efficient way of exchanging information in a business transaction. The frequency at which oral communication is applied may eclipse the level of complexity of its process.</p>
             <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Oral communication is a form of transmission of message through word of mouth. It is direct when two or more people meet to talk. This method of communication always involves a speaker and an audience. That audience can be one person or many people. Who that audience is influences what kind of communication takes place.</p>
                 <p>Oral communication can be direct or remote. It is direct when two or more people meet to talk and remote when a device such as telephone is used. The chief means of conveying messages in a business environment is oral communication. Speeches, formal one-to-one informal grapevine are popular forms organizations of oral communication in organizations.</p>

            <h3>Forms of Oral Communication</h3>
                <p>Below are some of the most commonly used forms of oral communication in organizations.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Unplanned exchange</li>
                  <li>Planned informal talk (public speaking)</li>
                  <li>Interview</li>
                  <li>Telephone cal!</li>
                  <li>Group meeting</li>
                  <li>Committee meeting</li>
                  <li>Full staff meeting</li>
                  <li>Formal presentation</li>
                </ul>
                  <p>Each of these forms of oral communication has both advantages disadvantages. Generally, however, they have the advantages of speed feedback, as they can allow a response within a minimal amount of time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unplanned exchange:</strong> This type of business communication involves a chance meeting at which a few words are exchanged by two or more people about a matter of common interest. A major advantage of this type of communication is that it is informal and gives an employee a sense of belonging within the organization, it also allows for faster means of conveying messages. However, unplanned exchanges may leave out important aspects of the subject.</p>
                    <p><strong>Planned informal talk:</strong> This is a relaxed, but with some element of formality. It may be an interim meeting to report progress on a project. Planned informal talks usually do not end on firm conclusions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interview:</strong> This is an exchange of words between two people or between one ‚Äòperson and a group of people. Interviews can take place for various reasons: in recruitment and selection of employees, in staff performance appraisal, in counseling employees, employee leaving the company, etc</p>
                    <p><strong>Telephone calls:</strong> This is the fastest form of oral business communication. Its major advantage is speed, directness, and ability to aid teleconferencing, telex, and other forms of communication technology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Group meeting:</strong> This form of business communication involves many people who come together lo discuss a common issue and reach a conclusion acceptable to the majority. Examples are a weekly management meeting, and an annual sales review. Group meetings need careful planning and direction. They can also be time consuming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Committee meetings:</strong> Committee meetings are discussions, which require a group of people to meet at regular intervals. The kind of talk is somewhat special in that committee members have specific functions. The talks are conducted along well-defined lines, which keep the members on focus. Advantages are that it allows a full discussion of the items by a range of different people and the proceedings will be well recorded in form of minutes or reports.</p>
                    <p><strong>Full staff meeting:</strong> This is a talk which involves all employees of an organization or department of an organization. Such meetings take place for various reasons, such as announcement of a new product, or impending changes in the organization. Such meetings are usually difficult to organize and are time consuming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Formal presentation:</strong> This form of business communication allows one person to present a detailed account of a subject such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>a college lecture</li>
                      <li>a training facilitation</li>
                      <li>a managing directors speech at a new product launch, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Formal presentations can he done with help of slides, video, and other audiovisual aids. Its major advantage is that it allows the presenter (sender) to convey ideas to a large number of people at one time.</p>
                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                  <p>Interviews are a form of conversation between two or more people who share an idea or information. A formal kind of interview is the meeting between two and a small group to discuss routine matters or affairs of a particular concern within their organization. Such meetings may take place between section heads and their deputies or employees of any level of the organization. Below are some of the most popular interviews conducted in organizations:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Selection interview</li>
                    <li>Promotion interview</li>
                    <li>Appraisal interview</li>
                    <li>Instructional interview</li>
                    <li>Disciplinary interview</li>
                    <li>Grievance interview</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Each type of interview is conducted for a specific purpose, as described below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Selection interview:</strong> A selection interview takes in deciding whether somebody is to be given a job. It takes place between an outside candidate and a prospective employer, or between an existing employee and his or her boss. The selection process may include tours of the company offices, factory and informal discussions with other members of staff</p>
                    <p>Actual interview takes place in the form of questions and answers between interviewer(s) and the candidate. Interview questions may be structured or unstructured. Structured questions are formal and are based on selection criteria for the vacancy to be tilled up. Unstructured questions are usually informal and may not be relevant to the job being tilled. The interviewer asks questions about the candidate's background in terms of education, work experience, level of competence, and any other questions, which might help in the assessment of the candidate's ability to perform the job. The candidate can also ask questions such as pay level.</p>
                    <p><strong>Promotion interview:</strong> This type of communication takes place when an employee has applied for a job of higher grade within the organization. Such an interview is conducted in a manner similar to that of select ion interview. The interview aims to determine whether the employee is suitable for the new position.</p>
                    <p><strong>Appraisal interviews:</strong> These are a form of oral communication, which aim at assessing the level of employee performance. They are also called staff or personnel performance appraisal, or staff evaluation. Appraisal interviews normally take place regularly, often on yearly basis. erl.ley are conducted by head of department or section.</p>
                    <p><strong>Instructional interview:</strong> This form oral communication is used to issue instructions about new procedures to key individuals within an organization. It is often conducted by senior managers when policies have been changed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disciplinary interview:</strong> This, perhaps, is the least pleasant form of oral communication in an organization. The interview is carried out by a senior employee (manager or supervisor) when a junior staff has been accused of violating company regulations. The interviewee may be allowed to bring a friend or anybody else as a witness. The interview must be conducted with complete impartiality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Grievance interview:</strong> Interview of this kind takes place when an employee feels he/she has been wrongly treated by another member of the organization. The grievance can he against I√®l]ow staff or supervisor. The interview must be conducted on basis or fticts and evidence, and must be as impartial as possible. Most large organizations have well defined grievance procedures, which all employees are expected to understand and follow.</p>
            <h3>Committees and Meetings</h3>
            <p>A committee is a group of people who are chosen by a larger group of people to make decisions or deal with a particular situation on behalf of the larger group. Committee meetings take place at regular prescribed intervals, for discussions and decisions in respect of the larger group. Committee may be composed of departmental representatives, product developers, staff representatives, and social clubs, among others.</p>
            <p>Various forms of committees are usually constituted for specific purposes in organizations. Some of the most common committees include those outlined below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Departmental meetings</li>
                <li>Product developers</li>
                <li>Staff representatives</li>
                <li>Social clubs</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Departmental representatives:</strong> This is the most common form of committee in an organization. They meet regularly to monitor the company's progress; to review sales figures; to formulate policies etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Product developers:</strong> These are people who are working together on a new product often meet regularly to discuss related issues.</p>
              <p><strong>Staff representatives:</strong> This is normally a consultative committee which brings together management and staff</p>
              <p><strong>Social clubs/dramatic societies:</strong> This is a group of people who do meet regularly to formulate their activities for the group.</p>
              <p>Other forms of committee (usually of larger size), include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Full employees' meeting</li>
                <li>Meeting of shareholders</li>
                <li>Annual general meeting</li>
              </ul>

              <p>For any committee to be successful it must be well organized.</p>

            <h4>Committee Procedures</h4>
            <p>Every committee may have its own procedures. There are, however, some aspects of procedure, which are common to most committees. They include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standing orders</li>
              <li>Committee members</li>
              <li>Committee documents</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Standing orders:</strong> These are a written set of rules by which a committee is run. Standing orders cover various aspects of committees such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Constitution</li>
              <li>Terms of reference</li>
              <li>Regularity of meeting</li>
              <li>‚úì Quorum of attendance</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Constitution:</strong> This is a set of guidelines, which define various aspects of a committee such as actual membership of the committee, details on who qualifies to become a member, how members are chosen, and roles of various categories of committee members.</p>
            <p><strong>Terms of reference:</strong> These are guidelines, which specify the scope within which the committee can carry out its mandate. For example, they spell out the extent to which a social/sports committee can incur or commit certain level of money without approval from higher authority.</p>
            <p><strong>Regulations of meetings:</strong> Standing orders also specify how frequent the meetings should be held, whether on a monthly, weekly basis, or as deemed necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>Quorum of attendance:</strong> The meeting must be a quorum before it can proceed. This means that a specified number of people known as a quorum must be present. Without a quorum, a meeting cannot take place. Any discussion held without a quorum will not represent the majority opinion.</p>

            <h4>Committee Documents</h4>
            <p>A series of documents are often essential for the successful running of a committee. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notice of meeting</li>
                <li>Agenda</li>
                <li>Chair's agenda</li>
                <li>Minutes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Notice of meeting:</strong> Committee members must be given adequate notice of each meeting. The notice is released to members by the secretary, specifying date, venue and time. The notice may solicit items for inclusion on the agenda. The previous meeting proceedings (minutes) may accompany the not ice.</p>
            <p><strong>Agenda:</strong> This is a list of items to be discussed at a meeting. It is circulated to committee members in good time- usually four weeks (month) before the meeting. An agenda may comprise two categories of items:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Fixed items</li>
            <li>Particular (special) items</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fixed items:</strong> These items are contained virtually in all agendas. They include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>‚úì Apologies for absence</li>
              <li>‚úì Minutes of the previous meeting</li>
              <li>‚úì Matters arising from the minute</li>
              <li>‚úì Correspondence</li>
              <li>‚úì Any other business (AOB)</li>
              <li>‚úì Date of next meeting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>‚úì <strong>Special items:</strong> These will generally fall into one of the following three categories:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>‚úì Reports and papers: these are items presented by one committee member who addresses the meeting using a document he has prepared earlier e.g. treasurer's report</li>
            <li>‚úì Proposals: Formal (written) suggestions on which committee will vote during the meeting</li>
            <li>‚úì Topics of discussion: These are topics read out for discussion (instead of a prepared document)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Chair's agenda:</strong> This is a special agenda prepared specifically for the use of a chair. The agenda usually itemizes topics for discussion, but at the same time indicates which individuals will be involved in introducing them.</p>
            <p><strong>Minutes:</strong> These are written records of proceedings and resolutions at the last meeting. Minutes serve as a legal record of events, and must be kept accurately. Minutes start by place and time, followed by listing all those who were present. Minutes are always iii past tense.</p>

            <h4>Formal Committee activities</h4>
            <p>committee meetings follow a very strict procedure. A typical committee meeting will normally involve at least some of the following activities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Starting the meeting</li>
                  <li>Calling apologies for absence</li>
                  <li>Reading minutes of last meeting</li>
                  <li>Matters arising from reading of the minutes</li>
                  <li>Discussion of agenda items</li>
                  <li>Proposing and seconding a motion</li>
                  <li>Voting</li>
                  <li>Amendments</li>
                  <li>Correspondence</li>
                  <li>Any other Business</li>
                  <li>Closing the meeting</li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Starting the meeting:</strong> When the chair is satisfied with a quorum, the chair calls the meeting o order. The chair then declares the meeting open. The chair's declaration may be preceded with a prayer. Anything said after the opening will be recorded, and language used must be formal. All discussions must be directed through the chair.</p>
            <p><strong>Apologies for absence:</strong> The secretary reads out the names of those absent with permission. Reason for absence need not be given.</p>
            <p><strong>Minutes of last meeting:</strong> The secretary reads out minutes of last meeting. Any differences between what was said and what was recorded must be corrected.</p>
            <p><strong>Matters arising from the reading:</strong> Matters, which were not concluded at the last meeting or items arising directly from the meeting, will be discussed at this stage. Reports regarding 'special assignments' may be given at this stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion of agenda items:</strong> This forms the main business of the meeting. A series of items outlined on the agenda are discussed, on the basis of a defined procedure.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion procedure:</strong> The procedure dictates that all discussions must be conducted through the Chair once deliberations begin officially. Speaking through the Chair means looking at the chairperson while speaking. Ruling from the chair involves Chair's rulings or intervention by declaring 'point of information' or seeking further clarification, which may be raised by a member until more information, is obtained.</p>
            <p><strong>Proposing and seconding a motion:</strong> A proposal takes place when a member suggests a course of action. Supporting such an idea is called seconding.</p>
            <p><strong>Voting:</strong> If the idea or suggestion is seconded the motion is put to vote. The Chair suggests formally that the committee move to the vote, and a show of hand is taken. The voting yields three categories of people:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>‚úì Those for.</li>
                <li>‚úì Those against.</li>
                <li>‚úì Those who abstain.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>A motion may be carried or defeated. Once a motion is passed, it is referred to as a resolution.</p>
            <p><strong>Amendments:</strong> These are changes in the wording of a proposed motion, which slightly alter its meaning. Such changes are often meant to make the motion more specific or precise.</p>
            <p><strong>Correspondence.</strong> When all items on the agenda have been discussed, the secretary reads out any correspondence, which has been received. The committee will discuss any action called for by the letter and make a decision.</p>
            <p><strong>Any Other Business (AOB).</strong> This is normally the last item for discussion. It provides opportunity for any additional matters to be raised and discussed.</p>
            <p><strong>Closing the meeting/adjournment.</strong> The chair may declare the last item for discussion. Once the last item has been exhausted, no further discussions may be allowed. The Chair, then, declares the meeting closed. It is a common practice to close such a meeting with a word of prayer.</p>

            <h2>üìö Lesson Five: Nonverbal Business Communication</h2>
            <p>In the previous chapter, we discussed oral communication and' examined how it applies to various business situations. We also discussed why oral communication must be consistent with nonverbal expressions for effective communication to take place.</p>
            <p>Non-verbal business communication is equally as important as other forms of business communication. Also called body language, non-verbal communication techniques are often used unconsciously. When speaking, we often throw about our hands or make some movement without knowing we are doing so. Non-verbal communication is an integral part of business communication; it includes all unwritten and unspoken messages, both intentional and unintentional, In this chapter, we examine nonverbal communication in terms of its relationship to other forms of communication.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Nonverbal communication is a way of passing messages through gestures, body movement, facial expression, and even silence. It is the creation of meaning without the use of words. Nonverbal communication is not suitable for expressing complicated, dense ideas. It is best,</p>
            <p>though, at communicating attitudes and subtle shades of meaning. In business environment, nonverbal communication may take several forms. For example, the size of an office, or how long you keep a visitor waiting and arrangement of merchandise in a show room may communicate pleasure or anger, friendliness or distance, power and status.</p>
            <p>Non-verbal business communication permeates all forms of speech. In written business communication a business letter communicates none verbally by its attractive appearance, or lacl of ii, as well as by the time it is sent.</p>

            <h3>Types of Non-verbal Communication</h3>
            <p>People can communicate through numerous forms of non-verbal behavior.</p>
            <p>Below is a List of some of the most common expressions in nonverbal communication.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Touching</li>
              <li>Personal space</li>
              <li>Orientation</li>
              <li>Gestures</li>
              <li>Posture</li>
              <li>Facial expressions</li>
              <li>Eye gaze/ eye contact</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These forms of verbal communication can be used selectively, depending on a particular situation.</p>

            <p><strong>Touching:</strong> The amount of touching (such as the pressure exerted when touching another person's body) can send a specific message. Touching is normally restricted in some societies. Handshake, for example, is not an acceptable way of greeting to all age categories in some societies. Research has established that people who touch others are often very popular. High status individuals are most likely to touch low-status individuals who often give their consent to the former to do so. In this respect, touch can signal status.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal space:</strong> This is linked to the touch, in that we do not touch continuously because of the space between us. Personal space is culturally based. People tend to keep a specific distance with the others, depending on the relationship between the persons involved and <p><strong>Personal space:</strong> This is linked to the touch, in that we do not touch continuously because of the space between us. Personal space is culturally based. People tend to keep a specific distance with the others, depending on the relationship between the persons involved and occasion. For example, Western culture allows spouses to have body contact by holding their hands while walking, whereas in some African culture, spouses keep a part. The more intimate relationship with the other person, the closer we will allow him or her to come. There are, therefore, specific spaces between boss and subordinate, a sales person and customer, public speaker and audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Orientation means the angle at which people interact with others. The position you take in a room, for example, tells others what they expect from you. Imagine you walk into a library and find an unoccupied table. You would sit at any position of your choice. If someone</p>
            <p>else had occupied the table you would decide a particular place of the table you should occupy, based on a particular situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Gestures:</strong> Gestures are a form of non-verbal business communication, which vary from culture to culture. Each type of gesture may have a different meaning to various cultures.</p>

            <p>Different cultures may attach different meanings to the following gestures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clenched fist</li>
                <li>Waving hand</li>
                <li>Pointing finger</li>
                <li>Clapping hands, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Gestures are used in business communication in areas such as:</p>
            <p>Illustrating what is being said. In public speeches, the speakers use gestures to clarify issues. Gestures also tell much about emotional state of the other persons.</p>
           <p><strong>Posture:</strong> The way we sit or stand is a good reflection of how we feel. Whereas facial expression signals which emotion is being felt, posture can indicate the degree of that emotion such as indicated in the examples below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úì A person in a drooping posture with frowning (passive) face and hands around the stomach can show a sign of stomachache.</li>
                <li>‚úì Upright position with vigorous movement (fast walk) can show a sign of excitement</li>
                <li>‚úì A person seated with his head drooping under the support of his hands might indicate depression, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Facial expression:</strong> One of the most common ways of showing emotion is through facial expression. The mouth and eyebrows are particularly critical in communicating through facial expression. Facial expression is an important source of feedback to a speaker It can tell the speaker whether the audiences are listening and interested.</p>
            <p><strong>g) Eye gaze and eye contact:</strong> Eye is a very important part of the body in dealing with others. People often make different remarks about others based on the eyes. For example:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>He has got scary eyes ‚Äî I fear him</li>
              <li>She is making eyes to me ‚Äî she loves me</li>
              <li>He was staring at me right through my eyes, etc</li>
             </ul>

            <h3>The Role of Nonverbal Communication (NVC)</h3>
            <p>You may, to some extent not consider non-verbal communication as important in business. For example, in carefully constructed verbal message, you might be tempted to ignore the importance of nonverbal business communication. In any case, verbal business communication holds enormous amount of meaning. Words can do so much to make meaning precise and rich. However, in oral communication, the non-verbal communication is ever active. Non-verbal communication, whether you are aware or not aware, can affect verbal business communication, positively or negatively. Effect of non-verbal communication can be seen in various forms including:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Communication imperative</li>
            <li>Importance of message</li>
            <li>Reinforcement of verbal behavior</li>
            <li>Contraction against verbal behavior</li>
            <li>Trust and credibility</li>
            <li>Replacement of words</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Business communication imperative:</strong> This is an aspect of business communication, which demonstrates the presence of non-verbal communication in whichever way we behave. In other words, some meaning will always be attached to any form of non-verbal behavior. Looking someone in the eye conveys meaning. Speaking or not speaking conveys meaning. That means even silence is a form of non-verbal communication. Your non-verbal behavior will always be a factor in business communication, even if you like it or not.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance of message:</strong> Non-verbal communication, some researchers indicate, forms ninety percent of a message's importance. Hence, you cannot afford to rely on verbal communication only.</p>
            <p><strong>Reinforcement of verbal behavior:</strong> Non-verbal business communication can provide cues that verbal message is credible. For example, if someone says, ‚ÄúI am really interested in the topic,‚Äù you expect eye contact, nodding, or some form of body language that is consistent with the person's statement.</p>
            <p><strong>Contradiction against verbal behavior:</strong> Nonverbal behavior can sometimes contradict verbal business communication.</p>
            <p>If, in the above example, the person says, ‚Äú1 am really interested in the topic‚Äù while the person is yawning, the person would be contracting the statement. In such a case, the verbal communication would be more unlikely believed.</p>
            <p><strong>Trust and credibility:</strong> Because people have less control over their nonverbal behavior than over their verbal message if it contradicts a verbal one. This concept is crucial It means that if you want to he trusted, you must have non-verbal business communication that is consistent with verbal.</p>
            <p><strong>Replacement of words:</strong> It is often said, ‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù Sometimes you may want to express your feelings but you have difficulty in saying exactly what you want. In this case, you can get more from a glance, a smile, a frowns than from words.</p>
            <p>In general, nonverbal communication can be used by complementing speech in numerous business circumstances as indicated below:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Touts use nonverbal language to communicate to prospective customers</li>
            <li>Employees at customer desks express their interest in customers through broad smiles or frown when disgusted</li>
            <li>A salesperson can emphasize features of a product through gestures</li>
            <li>A manager can regulate a meeting at a product launch by signaling people when it is their turn to talk</li>
            <li>A satisfied customer can give a positive feedback by smiling and nodding head.</li>
            </ul>
