            <h2>üìö Lesson Eight: Reports</h2>
            <p>In the previous chapter, we examined various forms of business letters and situations in which people in business can use them. As problems arise in the management of business, facts are presented to help solve the problems. This chapter focuses on reports as special forms of written communication in business environment. The chapter further examines different types of reports that are normally used in business.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Reports are a fact in business environment. As problems arise in the management of business, reports are written to analyze the pros and cons of the problems, alternative solutions are sought. facts and figures are verified. When employees must be persuaded to support a new policy, a report is written to lay out the case</p>

            <h3>Definition of a Report</h3>
                <p>A report is a specialized form of written business communication, which provides the information that people in organizations require to make plans and solve problems. Reports vary in size. They can range from a one-page report to 200 or more pages. For example, a report can be a one-page memo; PowerPoint slides printed and bound together; or a written explanation to a client about a product feature.</p>

            <h3>Forms of Reports</h3>
                <p>There are two broad forms of reports:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Informal reports</li>
                  <li>Formal reports Informal Reports</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Informal Reports</h4>
                <p>These types of reports are prepared by individuals within an organization. These are arc also called routine reports because they may be prepared on routine basis. Examples of such reports include representatives on sales visits, managers' reports on performance of their department's maintenance and equipment report, safety report, and accident report. Generally, all forms of reports, whether formal or informal, and regardless of size, provide information needed for decision-making. Detailed reports may be presented in tabular form or graphic form, with clear conclusions.</p>

            <h4>Formal Reports</h4>
                <p>A group of specially appointed individuals, who in turn present the report to their appointing authority, prepares formal reports.</p>
                <p>Also called special reports, they are prepared in a prescribed format, and are presented in a certain procedure. Examples of such reports include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reports written in response to requests for specific information</li>
                  <li>Reports made on a special topic after research and investigation</li>
                  <li>Reports regarding a change of policy</li>
                  <li>Market research reports</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../assets/images/module4-report-structure.png" alt="Diagram outlining the structure of a formal report." width="600" height="400">

            <h4>Elements of Formal Reports</h4>
                <p>A typical formal report normally has the following features:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Headings</li>
                  <li>Terms of reference</li>
                  <li>Procedure</li>
                  <li>Findings</li>
                  <li>Conclusion</li>
                  <li>Recommendation</li>
                  <li>Closing</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Headings:</strong> There should be two headings to a report</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>‚úì The name of the company</li>
                  <li>‚úì The report heading</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Terms of Reference:</strong> This section states exactly why the report is being written. The section answers several questions such as:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Why the report is being written?</li>
                  <li>What was requested?</li>
                  <li>Who requested it?</li>
                  <li>When you were asked to do it?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This section may take the following pattern:</p>
                <p>To report on... (Subject)...as requested by... (Name and title,) ...on... (Date,)...</p>
                <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> This part calls for a brief description of the method used to collect the information, such as interviews made, visits made, questionnaires administered, and meetings convened. Number points may be used, if appropriate.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong> This is normally the longest part of the report. It requires going through the procedure (above) point by point. It is appropriate to use numbers and sub-headings for this section. State systematically, under each heading, what information was gathered at each stage.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This part calls fort statement of logical implications of the findings. No new facts are introduced in this section. Inferences and conclusions are made from the findings (above).</p>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Again no new facts are introduces here. This part calls for suggestions for action, drawn from conclusions. Recommendations are not decisions; they are only suggestions of what action should be taken by the party that requested for the report.</p>
                <p><strong>Closing:</strong> A report should reflect the name(s) of the author(s) and title(s) and signature(s) against each name. It should also show the date the report was written.</p>

            <h4>Typical Business Reports</h4>
                <p>Organizations prepare thousands of different kinds of business reports for various stakeholders: managers, employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, government, etc. Gulffey et al (2001) classifies business reports into nine categories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>‚ùñ Periodic operating reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Situational reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Investigative I informational reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Compliance reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Justification / recommendation reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Yardstick reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Feasibility reports</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Research studies</li>
                  <li>‚ùñ Proposals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In business, these reports can be used selectively, depending on the need at hand. A brief description of each type of report is given below. -</p>
                <p><strong>Periodic operating report:</strong> This is the most common type of report. it is written onra regular basis e.g. weekly, monthly, or even daily. Such reports answer questions about what employees are doing and how effectively the organization is achieving its objectives. The report helps to monitor and control operations including production, sales, shipping and customer service.</p>
                <p><strong>Situational reports:</strong> Situational reports describe non-recurring activities. Included in this category are activities such as trips, conferences, and seminar reports; and progress reports for annual activities such as sponsorship of Boda Boda riding competition. Such reports normally describe one-time events. These types of reports are more challenging in terms of creativity than periodic reports.</p>
                <p><strong>Investigative/informational reports:</strong> These are reports that examine situations or problems and provide facts. They normally attempt to give interpretation or recommendations. Assume the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your boss asks you to research on a Kenya government agency's position on the hiring of independent contractors. You would collect and organize facts into a logical, informal report.</li>
                  <li>Now assume that your boss also wanted you to analyze the status of the independent contractor working for your organization and make recommendation about retaining them. Your report would be more analytical and classified differently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Compliance reports:</strong> Compliance reports are a special form of written communication that is usually prompted by the government. The reports answer such questions as how much profit an organization earned, and what taxes owed. These types of reports comply with laws and regulations that protect employees, investors and customers- Such reports respond to government agencies, such as the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), National Environmental Management Agency (NEMA), and Securities Prospectus which answers questions from potential stockholders regarding company performance and finances.</p>
                <p><strong>Justification/Recommendation reports:</strong> When managers and employees must justify or recommend something (such as purchases, charges in operations, new programs, or personnel.), they write justification or recommendation reports. These analytical reports usually travel upward to management, where the recommendations are approved or refused. Because these reports analyze alternatives, interpret findings, and make recommendations, they become important tools for managers in solving problems and making decisions.</p>
                <p><strong>Yardstick reports:</strong> When a problem has two or more solutions, a helpful way to evaluate the alternatives is to establish consistent criteria -a ‚Äúyardstick‚Äù-by which to measure the alternative. For example, let us say that a company must decide whether to (1) continue using its outdated mainframe computers, (2) purchase networked personal computers, or (3) hire an outside agency to handle some of its computing needs. A yardstick report would be used to assess the alternatives by applying the same criteria to each factor such as cost, service, security, and reliability. Each alternative is measured against the criteria to find the best option.</p>
                <p><strong>Feasibility reports:</strong> Feasibility reports use analysis to predict whether projects or alternatives are practical or advisable. For example, a fish processing company may answer question such as should we open a branch office in Migingo Island?‚Äù Feasibility reports examine the benefits and problems connected with the project as well as its cost and schedule for implementation. The emphasis is on whether to proceed with the venture.</p>
                <p><strong>Research studies:</strong> Business organizations sometimes commission research studies that examine problems thoroughly and scientifically. Researchers analyze a problem, suggest ways to solve it (called hypotheses), collect data about each possible solution, analyze that data, draw conclusions and, - if requested, make recommendations. The emphasis in these studies is on conducting objective research and interpreting the findings.</p>
                <p><strong>Proposals:</strong> As an organization attempts to secure new business, proposals offer to solve problems, investigate ideas, or sell products and services. They are organized to answer the receiver's questions regarding the offer and its budget, schedule, and staffing. Another form of proposal is the business plan, a persuasive report that seeks to convince investors to fund a new company.</p>

            <h2>üìö Lesson Nine: Visual Business Communication</h2>
            <p>We learn more easily through what we see than what we hear. Visual communication, therefore, forms an important part of business communication in our everyday lives. We are often exposed to a lot of information, which we internalize consciously or unconsciously. In business environment, visual communication remains one of the most effective means of demonstrating a point to targeted audience. This chapter focuses on visual communication as a powerfiul tool of presentation in business.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Visual communication is a method of passing information, through the use of images. A good visual image, can at a glance, speak a volumes of words. A picture of a road accident, for example, can send a message more effectively about careless driving than would a written article. The message can be even more effective when both the picture and written article are used at the same time. Moving images such as television and video have become increasingly important in business communication. They have been used in various ways including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Instructional medium in institutions of learning</li>
                  <li>Training sessions in organizations</li>
                  <li>Demonstrating features of a product</li>
                  <li>Communicating different aspects of business in an organization, among many other ways.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Visual Images and Presentations</h3>
                <p>Visual images are often used to enhance the differences of communication such as in presentations. A presentation in situation where one person formally talks to a group of people new product, change of policy, and organization s performance</p>

            <h3>Preparing for a Presentation</h3>
                <p>An effective presentation often requires a through preparation: The following steps are recommends for a good preparation.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Information gathering</li>
                  <li>Support material</li>
                  <li>Audio visual aids</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Information gathering:</strong> involves consulting specialist's colleagues and sources. Development information gathered is a vital aspect of preparation. Know the audience: Find out about your audience in terms of</p>
                <ul>
                <li>How many there will be</li>
                <li>What specialist knowledge they will have</li>
                <li>Their experience in business in general</li>
                <li>Their experience in the subject area (topic)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Support material:</strong> Prepare in good time any documents or handouts you intend the audience to have. Where provided, handouts should be brief and easy to read. The handouts must therefore be well presented, typed and. copied legibly.</p>
                <p><strong>Audio-visual aids;</strong> A well-prepared presentation will often involve the use of audio-visual aids. The following often come handy in formal presentations:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>+ <strong>Chalkboards:</strong> Chalkboards are the oldest teaching aid. They allow you to take down important points or demonstrate concepts quickly. Chalkboards may be difficult to write on especially where one is not used to them. Besides, they are dusty and may therefore create discomfort to both the speaker and the audience.</li>
                  <li>+ <strong>Flip charts:</strong> A flip chart is a bunch of large sheets of paper bound together like notepad. A felt pen is used to write on one sheet which, when full, is flipped over Flip charts are convenient to carry along, as the sheets can be folded into small sizes. Flip charts are relatively expensive and can only he used successfully with groups of between 1 5 and 20 people.</li>
                  <li>+ <strong>Marker boards (whiteboards):</strong> These are like chalkboards and require the use of felt pens to write. They can allow small handwritings, and are best suitable for presentations to small groups.</li>
                  <li>+ <strong>Overhead projectors:</strong> These are a type of equipment, which project images from a transparent sheet onto a screen or a wall. They have several advantages:
                    <ul>
                    <li>‚úì transparencies can be prepared in advance</li>
                    <li>‚úì You can blot out a section of the transparency to allow concentration required</li>
                    <li>‚úì Transparency sheets can be cleaned for re-use</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Overhead projectors may not be appropriate for all occasions. They have a number of disadvantages including:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>‚úì Small writings are usually illegible</li>
                    <li>‚úì The motor of the cooling fan may be noisy</li>
                    <li>‚úì The image may be distorted, unless the lens is well aligned</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>+ <strong>Transparency:</strong> This is a piece of flint usually the size of A4 paper, that can be written on and the writings shown on a screen by shining light through the film. Transparencies are used on overhead projectors.</li>
                  <li>+ <strong>Television:</strong> This is a piece of equipment with a screen on which you can watch programs with moving pictures and sound.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Visual Presentation</h3>
                <p>Visual aids make it easier to absorb voluminous information in documents. Presentation of a written repot, iii particular, can be done more effectively with the use of visual aids. Effective visual aids can increase reader's retention of information. Some of the most commonly used visual presentations are shown below:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Tables</li>
                  <li>Pie charts</li>
                  <li>Bar charts</li>
                  <li>Line charts</li>
                  <li>Diagrams</li>
                  <li>Maps</li>
                  <li>Gantt charts</li>
                </ul>
