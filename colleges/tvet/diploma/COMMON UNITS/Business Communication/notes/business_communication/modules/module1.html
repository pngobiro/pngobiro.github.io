          <h2>üìö Lesson One: An Overview to Business Communication</h2>
          <p>Communication is the thread that holds people together in their everyday lives, whether in social or business interaction. Communication binds together the actions of individuals or organizations to desired objectives. Lack of effective communication will most likely result in some kind of problems for individuals or organizations.</p>
          <p>This lesson looks at communication as a process that enables people to share ideas, opinions, or suggestions.  The lesson focuses on communication in general with emphasis on: characteristics of communication, elements in communication, and the process of communication.</p>

          <h3>Defining Communication</h3>
          <p>Communication can be defined as the transmission of information and understanding from one person or group to another. The goal is to share the information in a way that the two parties involved understand each other effectively.</p>

          <h3>Characteristics of Communication</h3>
          <p>People exchange ideas, feelings, thoughts, and statements every day. We can make highly important and descriptive statements about communication. Each of the statements we make expresses how complex communication is.</p>

          <h4>Communication is Omnipresent</h4>
          <p>Whatever form of our everyday behavior and activities, we remain very much a part of the communication process. Everywhere we turn, some kind of meaning is created within us, while at the same time creating a meaning in others. We read and talk; listen and react; we stare and remain mum. Communication is as obvious in our lives as breathing and eating. It follows, therefore, that communication is a human imperative ‚Äì something you must do. People will find meaning in everything you do.</p>

          <h4>Communication is Complex</h4>
          <p>Not every form of communication is as simple as it might seem to be on the surface. Communication involves many parts or pieces. Because we communicate so often, we hardly stop to think about how complex creating meaning can be.</p>

          <h4>Communication is Multi-level</h4>
          <p>There are several levels at which communication takes place. Sometimes, we create shared meaning within ourselves, or within others. We can communicate in a small group or in a very large group. These aspects of communication constitute four major levels:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Intrapersonal communication</li>
              <li>Interpersonal communication</li>
              <li>Person-to-group communication</li>
              <li>Mass communication</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Intrapersonal Communication</h5>
          <p>The meaning we create within ourselves is called intrapersonal communication. Quite often we make imaginations and even create situations to the extent of talking to ourselves. Sometimes we talk to ourselves aloud or in silence. Before we share a meaning with others, we create within ourselves the meaning we want to transfer with our message. Intrapersonal communication also takes place when we analyze a message we have received. Before you reply to a letter, for example, you think first.</p>

          <h5>Interpersonal Communication</h5>
          <p>This type of communication is between two or more people who actively participate in exchanging messages. Examples include a conversation between two people or a group participating in an interview. The level of effectiveness of communication varies; the smaller the group, the more effective the communication and vice-versa. The size of a group that allows interpersonal communication among all members is about 10-14 people.</p>

          <h5>Person-to-group Communication</h5>
            <p>Also called public speaking, this level of communication involves one person. In this, the person speaking is referred to as the speaker while the other persons are called the audience. The audience are addressed as a group rather than as individuals. The speaker sends a message to the receiver where the group receives the message as one receiver. Examples include church sermons, class lectures, report presentations, political rallies, etc. The group, who are at the same location, may be of infinite number.</p>

            <h5>Mass Communication</h5>
            <p>This form of communication, also called mass media, uses technology to communicate the same message to very large groups of people. The message involves the use of both print and electronic media. Print media include newspapers, magazines, posters, billboards, and other printed material, which enable thousands and millions of people to receive the same message. Electronic media allows message at the same time. Examples include radio, television, and internet, which allows people to interact with the developer of the message.</p>

          <h3>Elements in Communication</h3>
          <p>In all communications, at least some of the elements shown below must exist.  All business communications must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Originate from somewhere</li>
            <li>Be transmitted</li>
            <li>Have somebody at the other end to receive and understand the message</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The main features of communication are as shown below:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Motivation</li>
              <li>The aim</li>
              <li>Information</li>
              <li>The sender</li>
              <li>The message</li>
              <li>Encoding</li>
              <li>The medium</li>
              <li>The channel</li>
              <li>The receiver</li>
              <li>Noise</li>
              <li>Feedback</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Each of these elements is significant as described below:</p>
          <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> This is the primary urge ‚Äî the essence of communication. Motivation explains why communication takes place, e.g., the urge to meet the organization's objectives, the desire to do a job properly for pay, or the urge to tell someone your feelings towards them.</p>
          <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This is the more specific reason for communicating. There are four basic aims for communication:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Informing:</strong> The intention in this type of communication is simply to tell someone about something, e.g., a 'no smoking' notice, a letter giving news of recent events.</li>
                <li><strong>Influencing/persuading:</strong> The idea in this type of communication is to change someone else's opinion or attitude towards something, e.g., advertising, appeal against irresponsible sex to avoid HIV/AIDS.</li>
                <li><strong>Initiating action:</strong> This kind of communication is aimed to get the reader to do something, e.g., requesting for expense claims to be submitted to the accounts department, getting class assignments to be submitted to the lecturer by a particular date and time.</li>
                <li><strong>Entertaining:</strong> This type of communication is meant to get someone else entertained.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>NB:</em> All the four aims can sometimes be present within the same item of communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Information:</strong> This is the actual content of the message to be transmitted to someone else (the listener). Information need not be factual; it could be an idea, opinion, or a combination of facts and opinion.</p>
            <p><strong>The sender:</strong> This person originates and transmits the message to someone else. The sender can be an individual, a group of people, or an organization.</p>
            <p><strong>The message:</strong> This is the best and simplest form of idea, opinion, or fact transmitted to someone else. The transformation of information into its simplest understandable form is called encoding. When the information is encoded, it becomes the message. The message can be sent through different forms including: a letter, memo, telephone call, a smile, a shrug of the shoulders, and some other gestures.</p>
            <p><strong>The medium:</strong> This is a large group of ways of communicating. There are three major media:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Written communication:</strong> This media involves the use of letters, memos, books, articles, and any such written material.</li>
                <li><strong>Oral communication:</strong> This type of communication involves any method using spoken words such as meetings, telephone calls, interviews, lectures, and informal discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual communication:</strong> This type of media involves the use of the eye, such as drawing, photographs, or other ways of putting over a message by pictorial means.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The channel:</strong> This is the physical means by which the message is conveyed:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For written communication, channels may be notice boards, memos, public postal services, etc.</li>
              <li>For oral communication, channels may be personal interviews, committee meetings, departmental briefings, and class lectures.</li>
              <li>For visual communication, channels may be computer printouts, video slides, concerts, drawings, and other graphical expressions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The receiver:</strong> This is the individual person or body that receives the message. This can be an individual person, organization, department, political party, or government ministry.</p>
            <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Any factors which prevent effective communication from taking place can be noise. Noise can be physical, such as sounds of traffic, typewriters, or telephone bells, which interrupt a meeting. Other forms may be bad telephone connection, poor handwriting in letters, or conflicting messages through facial expressions or gestures that are not tallying with the sender's oral message.</p>
            <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> This is information which the sender receives back from the receiver confirming that the message was received in the same way in which the sender had meant. Feedback is a verifiable reaction of the receiver.</p>
            <p>Feedback can be given through the receiver's facial expression; the sender asking the receiver to repeat the message; or the receiver interrupting the communication process to seek clarification from the sender.</p>

          <h3>Communication Process</h3>
          <p>There are six basic steps in communication, which involve both the sender and receiver. These steps include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Conceptualizing</li>
              <li>Encoding information</li>
              <li>Information transfer (choosing appropriate channels)</li>
              <li>Receiving information and decoding it</li>
              <li>Interpreting information (tone, wording, etc)</li>
              <li>Feedback</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Both the sender and receiver play specific roles at the various stages of the communication process. In a typical, two-way communication process, the sender and the receiver play both roles alternately. The first three steps of the process involve the sender, while the last three steps involve the receiver.</p>

          <h4>The Sender</h4>
          <p>The first three steps of the communication process are the responsibility of the sender.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 1. Conceptualizing:</strong> This first stage of communication is in the form of an idea. The idea may be an opinion, an observation, or anything else for which the sender feels an urge. At this stage, the sender has the motivation, which forms the basis for communication. The sender defines the information to be sent and determines the aim of communication and the content to be conveyed.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2. Encoding information:</strong> The sender puts together information into the best and most suitable terms, which can be understood easily by the receiver. Encoding often involves putting an idea into words, putting an idea into a picture, or composing a song.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 3. Information transfer:</strong> This step comprises three components: the message, medium, and channel ‚Äî all of which exist for the actual transfer of information. All aspects are considered in determining cost, speed, printed record, and confidentiality.</p>

          <h4>The Receiver</h4>
            <p>Like the sender, the receiver plays a significant role in the communication process. The next four steps involve the receiver.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4. Receiving and Decoding Information:</strong> This stage comprises two components:</p>
            <p><strong>(a) Receiving information:</strong> At this stage, the receiver may take in the message by any method such as reading a letter, listening to a speech, watching a picture, or looking at an educational video. What the receiver gets from the sender does not make any meaning until the receiver decodes the message.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Decoding information:</strong> At this stage, the receiver interprets the message he or she has received. The receiver forms his or her own idea of the information conveyed to him or her.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 5. Interpreting the message:</strong> This stage involves understanding the correct meaning of the message on the part of the receiver. For example, is the message conveying a warning, commendation, or advice, based on the perceived tone of the sender? A message may be distorted if the receiver does not give it the correct meaning that the sender intended to convey.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 6. Feedback:</strong> This stage involves scanning the communication to ensure understanding and agreement between the sender and the receiver. For example, nodding and smiling may be a positive signal that both the sender and receiver are communicating effectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Noise, in the communication context, is anything that prevents a message from being received effectively. In the communication process, noise may exist in either physical or psychological forms. Physical noise could be a phone line with static, a motor vehicle roaring outside a classroom, or handwriting that is hard to read.</p>
            <p>Psychological noise could include dislike against a speaker, being concerned about anything else other than the message, or already having one's mind made up about an issue. Noise is a significant element in all communications as it is most likely to exist at all stages of the communication process, though at varied levels.</p>

            <h2>üìö Lesson Two: Organizational Communication</h2>
              <p>In the previous chapter, we examined the nature of communication in general. We also identified essential elements in communication, and the roles the sender and the receiver play in the communication process. The remaining chapters of this book will discuss communications as it applies to the business environment. Organizations are entities created for specific purposes. No matter the purpose of an organization, effective communication remains the key to the organization's success. The ability of individuals within an organization to communicate with each other and the entire organization to communicate with the public within its environment is crucial. The ability to communicate effectively in business is crucial to both the individual and the organization. For the individual, effective communication skills are necessary for getting the job initially, accomplishing assigned tasks, and advancing to higher positions within the organization. For the organization, effective communication results in developing and maintaining goodwill among employees, customers, and business associates while getting the job done efficiently.</p>
                <p>This chapter of the book focuses on organizational communication. Specifically, the chapter examines business communication as well as its directions within an organization.</p>
        </section>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Organizational communication is a system, a structured network that explains how information flows among the various units of an organization.</p>
                <p>A structured business communication network, therefore, enables an organization to reduce time wastage and ensures the messages are channeled to those who will understand the issues involved.</p>
                <p>Business communication can be defined as the transmittal or exchange of any information that deals primarily with business. Business communication involves the use of important skills such as reading, writing, speaking, listening, and nonverbal communication. Unlike social communication, business communication is highly structured and observes strict use of grammar. For example, Standard English is the language that is generally applied and accepted by all people who speak English.</p>

            <h3>Nature of Business Communication</h3>
              <p>Business communication, also defined as organizational communication, is fundamentally different from social and any other type of communication. Business communication takes place in organizations between employees and supervisors, among employees themselves, among supervisors themselves, and between the organization and external publics within its business environment.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of Business Communication</h3>
              <p>Good business communication always uses standard grammar and has certain features. Good business communication:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Avoids the use of slang</li>
                <li>Uses complete sentences</li>
                <li>Uses clear language. In speaking, unclear language usually confuses the audience. In writing, unclear language is usually characterized by poor grammar, spelling, and composition.</li>
                <li>Avoids prejudice. Good business communication uses neutral terms, such as chair or chairperson instead of chairman or chairwoman.</li>
                <li>Avoids assumptions and accusations. That is, the communication approaches all problems systematically and diplomatically: For example, a good business communication might say, "Unfortunately we do not have a refund policy" instead of ‚ÄúWe refuse to refund your money for the item you yourself have obviously broken."</li>
                <li>Is concise. That is, good business communication is to the point and unwordy.</li>
                <li>Is always polite and considerate. Good business communication always says ''thank you"</li>
                <li>In addition, it tries to be courteous and helpful whenever possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To communicate effectively in the world of business, you must have a sound grounding in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It does not matter your status in an organization, you will need good business communication to discharge your duties and responsibilities effectively and efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Direction of Business Communication</h3>
              <p>Organizational business communication takes place in two primary directions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Vertical direction</li>
                    <li>Horizontal direction</li>
                </ol>

            <p><strong>1. Vertical business communication</strong> flows from down upwards as well as from top downwards. This type of communication takes place between people of different levels of seniority in the organization. It takes place in two directions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Upward, and</li>
                  <li>Downwards</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Upward business communication:</strong> People involved at the of the organization's activities communicate upwards, supervisory or managerial level.</p>

            <h4>Forms of Upward Communication</h4>
              <p>There are various forms of upward communication, the most common of which include, informal discussions, suggestion schemes, polls and ballots, and grievances.</p>

                <p><strong>Informal discussions/suggestions:</strong> This is the most frequent form of business communication. It involves workers talking to supervisors about various events, e.g. machine breakdowns, ideas for new approaches, or any other matter arising during working activity.</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestion schemes:</strong> Workers may suggest improvement in work processes by these formal schemes. Special forms may be involved; and employees may be encouraged to participate through incentives.</p>
                <p><strong>Polls and ballots:</strong> Polls and ballots are forms of business communication, which help in determining the feelings of employees about issues of a policy or procedure. These forms of communication allow employees to vote for or against a proposal. Where employees are to be consulted, through this method of communication, a meeting would usually be organized or a questionnaire prepared to canvass opinions.</p>
                <p><strong>Grievance procedures:</strong> This form of upward organizational communication allows employees who feel they have been unfairly treated to appeal against the decision. Employees can appeal against issues such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>failure to gain promotion</li>
                      <li>unfair disciplinary action</li>
                      <li>unfair transfer</li>
                      <li>unfair work assignment</li>
                      <li>unfair rewards, etc</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The employee may make known his grievance by:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>completing a form</li>
                      <li>arranging an interview with the supervisor</li>
                      <li>Contacting a trade union representative, among others.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>Downward Organizational Communication</h4>
            <p>Organizational communication vertically downwards is the most common one. It involves superiors communicating downwards to their juniors.</p>

            <h4>Forms of Downward Organizational Communication</h4>
            <p>Organizations use a variety of channels in downward communication, some of which are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Memos</li>
                  <li>Newsletters</li>
                  <li>Training and induction documents</li>
                  <li>Letters</li>
                  <li>Notices</li>
                  <li>Company handbooks</li>
                  <li>Health and safety policy documents</li>
                  <li>Joint consultative and other committees</li>
                  <li>Full meetings</li>
                  <li>Appraisal interviews</li>
                  <li>Disciplinary interviews</li>
                  <li>Exit interviews</li>
              </ul>

                <p>The most appropriate form of business communication must be selected carefully for accurate, clear and cost effective message. Below is a brief description of each of the channels:
                <strong>Memo:</strong> This is a formal written communication sent between members of the same organization. Managers may use memos to convey messages about assignments, reprimands, commendations, among other things.</p>
                <p><strong>Training and induction documents:</strong> These types of documents may convey information about training programmers such as type of training, duration of training, and training provider, among other things.
