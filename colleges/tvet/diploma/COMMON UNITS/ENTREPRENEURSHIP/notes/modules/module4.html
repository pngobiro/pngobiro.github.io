            <h2>üìö Content</h2>
             <p>Customers‚Äô tastes and needs are continually changing. Thus there is need for the entrepreneurs to think of new ideas and better methods of running their businesses in order to satisfy the customer. Creativity and innovation are therefore key to generation of such new ideas and methods of improving goods and services to meet the customers‚Äô needs.</p>
                <p>This sub-module unit discusses the importance of creativity and innovation, the barriers to creativity and innovation including managing barriers to creativity and innovation.</p>

                <h3>Meaning of creativity and innovation  </h3>
                <ol>
                <li><em>i) Creativity</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Creativity is the ability to bring something new into existence. It is the ability to think and act in new ways. This is done through the process of germination, preparation, incubation, illumination and verification.</p>

                <ol>
                <li><em>ii) Innovation</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is the process of doing things in a new way for value addition. It is thinking creatively about something already existing.  Innovation transforms creative ideas into useful application. For example, having a new use for old things. It is also an intentional change to add value. For example, the tape recorder, walkman, and CD player are all innovations on the phonograph or landline telephone to cell (mobile) phone.</p>
                <p><em>iii)        Discovery</em></p>
                <p>It is making known that which has been in existence but whose uses have not been perceived. For example,  Harvey‚Äôs discovery of the circulation of blood.</p>
                <ol>
                <li><em>Invention</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>It means bringing something new that has not been in existence into existence. It is the act of creating or producing by exercise of the imagination and have no prior existence. For example, cellular  phone money transactions.</p>

                  <h3>Process of creativity and innovation</h3>
                 <p>The process most commonly used to encourage creativity is brainstorming. It works best in a group situation. Another process that can be used both individually and in a team environment is the SCAMPER process. The process works particularly well in creating new products and services that will add additional value to customers. Here is how to use the SCAMPER process, step by step:</p>

                 <p><strong>S</strong>UBSTITUTE</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Think of ways of replacing one thing with another. For example, could plastic replace wood, aluminum, or steel? Could electronic transfer replace the mail or a phone call replace a fax message?</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>C</strong>OMBINE</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Are there ways of bringing things together that could result in one unique item? For example, could some services be combined to produce one-stop shopping?</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>A</strong>DJUST, ADD, OR ADAPT</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Figure out what changes can be made to improve products. Similar products could be added together, for example, such as two blades joined to a twin razor. Adding stamps to each other can create a single roll or sheet. An alternative is to unite dissimilar products to create something new, such as a Swiss Army knife.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>M</strong>ODIFY, MAGNIFY, OR MINIATURIZE</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Think about the possibilities of changing the size or the nature of the product itself. Post-it Notes have done an exceptional job of taking the basic technology of a multiple-stick product and producing different sizes, colours, shapes, and uses.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>P</strong>UTPRODUCTS TO OTHER USES</p>
                <ol>
                <li>This is a commonly used strategy. Excess newspapers can be made into fire logs; a kitchen knife can be used as a screwdriver.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>E</strong>LIMINATE OR ELABORATE</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Consider the benefits that can be derived from less use. For example, packaging is reduced if refills are used. Generic products save advertising.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>R</strong>EARRANGE OR REVERSE</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Investigate the advantages of changing the order or sequence of events, or see if things can work the opposite way. One example with a twist on this theme would be a car that goes in two directions, not only one.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>THE PROCESS OF INNOVATION</h4>
                <p>Creativity as a process has several stages. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Germination Getting the mind ready for creative thinking using</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>methods such as</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>realizing that every situation is an opportunity to learn</li>
                    <li>reading on a variety of topics/subjects</li>
                    <li>creating a file of interesting articles</li>
                    <li>developing the ability to listen to and learn from others</li>
                    <li>attending professional/ trade association meetings, both to brainstorm with others having a similar interest and to learn how others have solved a particular problem.</li>
                    </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Investigation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Studying the problem and understanding its components</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Transformation.</li>
               </ol>
                <p>Identifying the similarities and differences in the information collected.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Incubation.</li>
                </ul>
                  <p>The subconscious needs time to reflect on the</p>
                    <p>information collected. Incubation can be enhanced by</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>doing something totally unrelated to the problem/opportunity under investigation</li>
                      <li>taking time to reflect (freeing the mind from self imposed restrictions)</li>
                      <li>playing and relaxing</li>
                      <li>thinking about the issue before going to sleep so that the subconscious can work on it during sleep</li>
                      <li>working on the problem or opportunity in a different environment.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>This occurs when all the previous stages start getting</p>
                      <p>clear.</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Verification.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Involves testing if the idea will work, is practical to implement and is a better solution to a particular problem or opportunity. Experiments, test marketing and piloting are some of the methods that can be used.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Implementation.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Transforming the idea into reality by bringing it to the market. This is what distinguishes the entrepreneur from the inventor.</p>

                      <h3>Importance of creativity and innovation</h3>
                      <p>Creativity and innovation are key to generation of new ideas and methods of improving goods and services for customer satisfaction. They are key to the success of a business particularly when strategizing during strategic planning, and when designing new products and services. Creative thinking and innovation are particularly useful during planning and setting out strategies to compete.  Thus creativity and innovation:</p>
                      <ol>
                      <li>i) Leads to increased productivity</li>
                      <li>ii) Helps in profit maximization</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>iii)        Motivates employees to become more creative</p>
                      <ol>
                      <li>iv) Leads to diversification of products and services</li>
                      <li>v) Introduces a variety of goods and services</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>In order to arouse creativity, the following ideas may be explored:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Is there a better way of doing things in a business organisation?</li>
                      <li>Need to challenge custom, routine and traditions of the organization.</li>
                      </ul>

                       <h3>Barriers to creativity and innovation</h3>
                      <p>These are limitations to creativity and innovation which may include the following:</p>
                      <p><strong>Negative Attitude</strong></p>
                      <p>The tendency to focus on the negative aspects of problems and expend energy on worry.</p>
                      <p><strong>Fear of Failure</strong></p>
                      <p>For an entrepreneur failure is not a discouraging factor but is a necessary condition and a stepping stone to success.</p>
                      <p><strong>Executive Stress</strong></p>
                      <p>It is the state of not having time to think creatively. An over-stressed person finds it difficult to think objectively. Unwanted stress reduces the quality of all mental processes. An entrepreneur should avoid executive stress because it hampers creativity</p>
                      <p><strong>Following Rules</strong></p>
                      <p>A tendency to conform to accepted patterns of belief or thought ‚Äì the rules and limitations of the status quo ‚Äì hampers creative breakthrough. Some rules are necessary, but others encourage mental laziness.</p>

                      <p><strong>Making Assumptions</strong></p>
                      <p>Both conscious and unconscious assumptions restrict creative thinking. There is a need for an entrepreneur to identify and examine assumptions made to ensure new ideas are not excluded.</p>
                      <p><strong>Over-reliance on Logic</strong></p>
                      <p>This is investing all intellectual capital into logical or analytical thinking ‚Äì the step-by-step approach ‚Äì which excludes imagination and therefore creativity.</p>

                      <p><strong>Other barriers include the following:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>High cost of research and development.</li>
                      <li>Inability to protect invention through patents</li>
                      <li>Searching for the one right answer</li>
                      <li>Being over specialized</li>
                      <li>Believing that one is creative</li>
                      <li>Creativity is not taken seriously</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Managing barriers to creativity and innovation</strong></p>
                        <p>Barriers to creativity and innovation can be overcome by removing obstacles to creativity and logical thinking. The barriers to creativity can be managed using the following process:</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 1:  Experience<br />
                        </strong>Experience is needed in order for one to discover a creative solution.  That requires being open to ones environment and feelings.<br />
                        However, there are blocks to obtaining experience such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fear of not learning</strong>.  If you feel unable to retain information, you'll be anxious about new experiences.  If you fear being tested on what you were supposed to learn, you may shut down.  If your self-concept calls you incompetent, you won‚Äôt put yourself in a position to be humiliated.  And if you are always being compared to people who are supposedly ‚Äúbrilliant,‚Äù you may be driven away.  All of these can limit your experiences.</li>
                        <li>Fear of violating standards.  Were you raised to believe that certain topics are ‚Äúnone of your business,‚Äù certain actions ‚Äúimpertinent‚Äù?  If these feelings cause you to feel ‚Äúout of bounds,‚Äù you'll avoid investigating a wide range of phenomena and your curiosity will shut down. You may even close off your unconscious and all the creative potential it holds.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Stage 2:  Association<br />
                        </strong>You must be able to associate experiences into a useful product.<br />
                        What are the blocks to making associations?</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><em>Over valuing rationality.</em>  If you stay in control by being utterly rational, you may reject associative thinking, and forgo using intuition.  Equally, you will curtail your creativity..</li>
                        <li>Fear of self-awareness.  To make useful associations, you must avoid self-deception and understand the consequences of your actions.  For example, one lab director eventually realized that his unwillingness to acknowledge other people‚Äôs contributions stemmed from his fear of seeming incompetent.  Denigrating the ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù helped him avoid feeling uncreative himself.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Stage 3:  Expression  </strong><br />
                        Once you‚Äôve associated diverse experiences or information, you must express your idea: a creative association isn‚Äôt worth much unless you can communicate it.</p>
                        <p>What are the obstacles to expression?</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fear of embarrassment</strong>.  If you are  uncertain of your abilities, fear criticism, or fear speaking before a group (or certain individuals), you‚Äôll have difficulty bringing ideas to light.  Such ideas will remain underdeveloped for lack of feedback.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fear of assertion.</strong>  If you express what you feel, will people still like you?  Will you get into trouble?  <u>Tom Sawyer</u> always figured that ‚Äústaying mum‚Äù kept him out of a jam; but if you agree, your inhibition about expressing ideas will limit your creativity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stage 4:  Evaluation</strong><br />
                        People who undervalue their ideas tend not to be creative.  Some hurdles an stand in the way of your evaluation process:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Fear of humiliation.  If you rate your solution highly, and other people think it‚Äôs rotten, you could end up looking like a boaster or fool.  (That‚Äôs why people adopt false modesty or convince themselves that their creations are boring or obvious.)</li>
                        <li>Fear of rejection.  On the other hand, if you are negative about your own solution or product, people may ignore it‚Äîand you.  After all, if you don‚Äôt think much of your work, why should they?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stage 5:  Perseverance<br />
                        </strong>Original ideas and products are fun, but unless you persevere, they won‚Äôt make anybody rich. The concept of continuous improvement says any process or product should be endlessly revised and improved.<br />
                        Perseverance-related blocks include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Fear of failure.  What if you carry your idea to completion and find it‚Äôs not as good as you thought (meaning you‚Äôre incompetent)?  Therefore play it safe by failing to develop your product to the point where it‚Äôs a truly creative work.</li>
                        <li>Lack of rewards.  Much of your creative activity is probably motivated by the admiration your creations inspire in others. Unfortunately, for many people, the work needed to turn a creative impulse into a product is less rewarding. Do you regard yourself as an ‚Äúidea‚Äù person instead of a ‚Äúdetail‚Äù person?  This attitude may partly stem from fear that you are poor at follow-through, meaning your impulse will come to naught.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other ways of managing barriers to creativity  would include:<br />
                        :</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Budgeting for research and development</li>
                        <li>Strengthening public institutions that process the(such as KIRDI, KIPRI and WIPO) patenting proces</li>
                        <li>Rewarding creativity</li>
                        <li>Promoting creativity training</li>
                        <li>Avoiding mental blocks</li>
                        <li>Being systematic</li>
                        <li>Being a problem solver</li>
                        <li>Approaching issues from different angles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Embracing divergent views</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>üìù<strong>Summary:</strong></p>
