                <p>An Entrepreneurial Culture is a system of shared values, beliefs and norms of members of an organization or community. It includes; valuing creativity and tolerance of creative people, believing that innovating and seizing market opportunities are appropriate behaviors to deal with problems of survival and prosperity, environmental uncertainty, and competitors‚Äô threats, and expecting the community and organizational members and to behave accordingly.</p>

                <p>An entrepreneurial culture will lead to the growth of trade and industry in a country.</p>

                <p>This sub-module unit discusses the concept of entrepreneurial culture and the factors that inhibit entrepreneurial development.</p>

                <h3>Concept of Entrepreneurial Culture </h3>
                <p>Culture encompasses a wide variety of elements, such as values, norms and artefacts. These are dependent on language, social situations, religion, political philosophy, economic philosophy, education, manners and customs.</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Values </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>These are ideas about what is important in life. They guide the rest of the society.</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Norms </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>These are expectations of how people will behave in different situations. Each culture has different methods called sanctions of enforcing norms.</p>
                <p>Sanctions vary with the importance of the norm.</p>
                <p>Norms that society enforces formally are called laws</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Artefacts </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These refer to material culture. They are derived from the cultural values and norms.</p>

                <p><strong>NB:</strong> Culture is dynamic. Cultural change can be caused by the environment inventions and other internal influences and contact with other cultures.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Some inventions that affected western culture in the 20<sup>th</sup> century were the birth control pill, television</p>
                <p>and the Internet. The television brought similar visual programmes into many homes but influences how and when family members interact with each other.</p>
                <p>The rate of savings and investment depends on the influence of cultural benefits upon the people. The culture may emphasise on some jobs while detesting others. Some communities may be more entrepreneurial than others. For example, the joint family system in which elders opinions are not questioned, may lead to children who are unable to develop, expand, innovate or change the business.</p>

                 <h3>Elements of Entrepreneurial Culture</h3>
                <p>The following are elements of entrepreneurial culture:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>People are empowerment focused</li>
                <li>Value creation through innovation and change</li>
                <li>Attention to the basics/detail</li>
                <li>Hands-on management</li>
                <li>Doing the right thing</li>
                <li>Freedom to grow and to fail without embarrassment</li>
                <li>Commitment and personal responsibility</li>
                <li>Emphasis on the future</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>NB:</strong> It is through the interaction of founding values, theories and new venture that organisational culture begins to take shape and perpetuate itself.</p>
                  <p>If long term values are held then the creation of culture by the entrepreneurial team may be a good predictor of the future of the firm.</p>
                  <h3>Habits that promote entrepreneurial development </h3>

                <p>As stated earlier, values, norms and beliefs guide the society towards acceptable behaviour which leads to formation of good habits which may promote entrepreneurial development. The habits include:</p>

                    <p>A person who is independent finds it      difficult to work for others. Such a person also has the ability to create and innovate, therefore promoting entrepreneurial development.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      <li>
                        <em>Direct/personal involvement </em>
                        <p>An entrepreneur is a hands-on person and believes in participatory approach.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><em>Risk taking</em>
                      <p>An entrepreneur continually takes moderate or calculated risks.  This enhances growth of the enterprise.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><em>Willingness to fail or make mistakes </em></li>
