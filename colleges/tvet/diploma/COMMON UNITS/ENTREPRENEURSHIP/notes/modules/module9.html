   <h3>Forms of business ownership </h3>
    <p>The following are the types of business organisations:</p>
    <p><strong>i)Sole proprietorship</strong> ‚ÄìThis is a business owned by one person.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Advantages.</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Ease of formation: </em>this is the easiest form of business organization to establish. There are no complex forms to complete and no documentation required between you and any other party. It involves registering your choice of business with the registrar of companies by filling in a simple form and paying a small registration fee.</li>
    <li><em>Easy to raise capital. </em></li>
    <li><em>Owner makes independent decisions: the</em> business owner has complete control over the business is solely responsible for all decisions in the business.</li>
    <li><em>Owner has personal contact with employees and customers.</em></li>
    <li><em>Owner enjoys all the profits. </em></li>
    <li><em>Flexibility: </em>the business owner is able to respond quickly to business needs in day-to-day management decisions of the business. One can easily take advantage of an attractive business opportunity.</li>
    <li><em>Total control of business</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Bears all the losses.</em></li>
    <li><em>Capital base may be limited: </em>This kind of business has less financing capacity. The amount of funds a sole proprietor can raise is limited to their assets and their credit worthiness.</li>
    <li><em>Has unlimited liability</em>: The business owner has little or no protection against personal liability in the event of bankruptcy or adverse legal judgement. Personal assets such as the owners house, land, car and investments are liable to be seized if necessary to pay outstanding debts.</li>
    <li>Success of the business depends on the entrepreneur‚Äôs hard work.</li>
    <li>Business operations can be affected by death of the owner.</li>
    </ul>

     <p><strong>ii)Partnerships</strong></p>
    <p>A partnership is an association of two or more persons who come together to carry on a business with a view to making profit. Although it is possible to establish a valid partnership without a formal agreement, it is advisable to sign an agreement first. The agreement will state:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The effective date of the partnership.</li>
    <li>The business name of the partnership.</li>
    <li>The contributions of capital by each partner</li>
    <li>How the business profits and losses will be shared.</li>
    <li>How a partner may withdraw from the partnership</li>
    <li>How the business assets and liabilities will be shared in the event of a dissolution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Capacity for more capital; </em>partners can raise more capital than a sole trader. The asset base is much higher.</li>
    <li><em>Work is divided among partners.</em></li>
    <li><em>Better combination of skills and talents: </em>for example,<em> a mechanic and driver could successfully combine resources and talents to start a driving school. </em></li>
    <li><em>Losses and liabilities are shared among partners. </em></li>
    <li><em>Business can easily expand. </em></li>
    <li><em>Formation of the business is simple: </em>the registration and legal formalities are easy and simple.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>The liability of partners is unlimited.</li>
    <li>Partners are likely to disagree on various matters affecting the business.</li>
    <li>If one partner makes a mistake, all other partners suffer the consequences.</li>
    <li>Some partners may work harder than others, yet the profits are shared. This may discourage a hard working partner.</li>
    <li>If the business relies heavily on one partner and the partner leaves or dies, the firm can easily collapse.</li>
    <li>Control is shared</li>
    </ul>

     <p><strong>iii)        Private limited company</strong> ‚Äì It is formed by a minimum of two shareholders</p>
    <p>and a maximum of fifty.</p>
    <p><strong><em>            Advantages </em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Can raise more capital through sale of shares.</li>
    <li>It has limited liability.</li>
    <li>Death of a shareholder does not affect its operations.</li>
    <li>They are managed by professionals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Shareholders can only transfer their shares with the consent of other shareholders.</li>
    <li>The company is not allowed to appeal to the public for extra capital, so it may find it difficult to raise money for expansion.</li>
    <li>Accounts of the company must be filed annually with the registrar of companies.</li>
    </ul>

     <p><strong>iv)Public limited company</strong> ‚Äì It has a minimum of seven shareholders and no</p>
    <p>maximum number of shareholders</p>

     <p><strong><em>            Advantages </em></strong></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Shareholders liability is limited to the amount contributed.</li>
    <li> It can raise more funds through sale of shares.</li>
    <li>There is no restriction on the transfer of shares.</li>
    <li>Public companies can easily expand due to large capital base.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>Disadvantages</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
    <li>The procedure of forming the company is long and complicated.</li>
    <li>Raising capital can be expensive due to the cost involved.</li>
    <li>As the company grows it may be difficult to manage.</li>
    <li>Once established it has to comply with many regulations.</li>
    <li>The accounts of a public company must be published, so there is no secrecy or privacy about its affairs.</li>
    <li>Owners exercise little control over the business.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>v) Co-operative</strong> ‚Äì It is formed by people with a common interest such as those in the same trade or dealing in similar commodities.</p>

    <p><strong>Business life cycle </strong></p>
    <!--Image for Business Life Cycle-->
      <img src="../assets/images/module9-business-life-cycle.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the business life cycle, with stages: Establishment, Growth, Expansion, Maturity, and Decline." width="600" height="300">
    <p><strong>Business Life Cycle: 5 Stages of Small Business</strong></p>
    <p>In the small business life cycle not every business will go through every stage, and not all small businesses will succeed as a result of these stages. However, they are proven stages or small business that are an important part of running a small business, whether from home or from a formal office.</p>

    <p><strong>Stage One</strong></p>
    <p>The first stage of any small business is obvious ‚Äì establishment. At this stage, the business is being created, planned and the early days of its operations take place.</p>
    <p>For some, this is the only stage that a small business may see, as it is by far one of the most difficult to survive. Many things can go wrong at this stage; thus, good business planning a crucial and necessary part of it.</p>
    <p>Without a good business plan, it is impossible to get a small business off the ground, running and eventually moving through to the next stages of its life cycle.</p>

    <p><strong>Stage Two</strong></p>
    <p>The second stage of small business in the small business life cycle is the growth period.</p>
    <p>During this stage, a business has an initial time of negative profit until it breaks even and begins to show increased revenues that allow it to truly grow. This is also the stage that the real test of a business comes into play.</p>
    <p>How the business is managed and how it is able to compete within its designated market will determine whether it will survive, heading to the next stage ‚Äì or whether it will decline and reach the last stage of its life.</p>

    <p><strong>Stage Three</strong></p>
    <p>The third stage of small business is about expansion. This is the point at which a business gets to the point where there is sufficient revenue being brought in so that there are no doubts of its survival and it can expand its horizons.</p>
    <p>This includes taking on staff, expanding the office space of the business or even investing in equipment to deal with a larger base of clientele. This stage also entails producing more products if necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>Stage Four</strong></p>
    <p>The fourth stage of small or other business is about maturity.</p>
    <p>The business is now stable enough to survive most unforeseen circumstances. It has enough backing, capital and support to ensure that even if the market becomes unstable, it can pull through.</p>
    <p>This may be accomplished by rearranging its management plan, getting rid of one product to replace another or adding an additional product to an already existing product line.</p>
    <p>However, if the market declines, it may survive, though its profits may take a temporary slide backwards.</p>

    <p><strong>Stage Five</strong></p>
     <p>In the small business life cycle the fifth stage of small business, is about decline. In fact, it is the easiest stage to reach for any business because it is the point where a starting business will fail.</p>
    <p>An existing business, even a mature one, can decline in profits, take heavy losses and eventually either fail or cease operations to avoid further losses. As any small business owner can attest to, the stages of business are necessary and a normal part of the small business life cycle.</p>
