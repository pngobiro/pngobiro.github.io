                <ul>
                <li>Personal finance- personal savings are a major source of capital during the start-up stage. The personal savings may be obtained from former employment, money saved in savings/ fixed deposit accounts, sale of personal assets such as land.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Advantages of this source are:</em></p>
                <ul>
                <li>It is the least expensive since no interest is paid.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>Retained earnings ‚Äì These are the unutilized profits from previous years which can be used to finance other needs such as expansion and acquisition of more assets.</li>
                <li>Provision for depreciation and provision for taxation ‚Äì These can only be borrowed for a short period of time before replacement of depreciated assets or payment due to taxes that are made .</li>
                <li>Sale and lease back ‚Äì A business can opt to sell its assets and then lease the same from the new owner. It will be paying rent for use of the assets.</li>
                <li>Sale of assets ‚Äì A business could have at its disposal assets that can be converted into cash. Good examples of such assets are old equipment, motor vehicles and other chattels.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
                 <p>External sources of business finance.</p>
                  <p>This type of finance is obtained from persons and parties other than the business owners.</p>
                    <p>Examples of external sources are:-</p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>Trade creditors ‚Äì these provide a business with goods on credit terms such as 90 days before repayment can be made.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The entrepreneurs can sell the goods and use the proceeds to pay off the creditor on the due date.</p>
                    <ol start= "2">
                    <li>Loans ‚Äì these are borrowings from commercial lending institutions. The terms and institutions vary from one institution to another.</li>
                    <li>Overdrafts ‚Äì These are short term sources of finance from commercial banks that a business can resort to in order to solve its liquidity problem. The repayment period is normally one year.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <li>Hire Purchase ‚Äì a business can get equipment from a hire purchase firm and pay for them in installments until the whole line purchase price is paid. It becomes the property of the business when the last installment is paid, otherwise it was on hire before such last payment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Types of Business Records</h3>
                    <p>There are various types of records that may be maintained by a business depending on the size of the business. The following are some of the important business records:</p>

                     <h3>Recording business transactions in the books of accounts </h3>

                          <p>Financial statements are important for the entrepreneur in determining whether the business is operating at a profit or a loss and the financial wealth of the business. Two major financial statements the entrepreneur requires for sound decisions are:</p>

                          <p><u>Trading, profit and Loss Account </u></p>
                          <p>The financial statement is prepared to determine whether a business is operating at a profit or  a loss for a given period of time. E.g. one year</p>
                          <p><u>Trading Account </u></p>
                          <p>The trading account is prepared to determine the gross profit. The gross profit is the difference between the net sales and the cost of sales</p>

                          <p><strong>INTERPRETATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS </strong></p>
                           <p>As financial statements have been worked out, it is necessary to compare the relationship between items in the balance sheet and those in the profit and loss account. This gives a clearer picture of the company‚Äôs performance in relation to the prevailing economic conditions.</p>
                           <p>The interpretation can be in the form of ratios, or percentages showing different relationships. They are categorised into:</p>
                          <ol>
                          <li>Profitability ratios</li>
                          <li>Turnover ratios</li>
                          </ol>
                          <ul>
                          <li>Return ratio</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Examples of such interpretations are as follows:</p>
                          <p><strong>Profitability ratios </strong></p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Current ratios </em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>This is used to gauge the ratio of current assets compared to current liabilities. It is computed as:      <u>Current Assets (CA)</u></p>
                          <p>Current Liabilities (CL)</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Gross profit to sales or the gross profit margin </em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Gross profit is given by sales less cost of sales. Gross profit to sales is worked as follows:</p>
                          <p><u>Gross Profit</u> √ó 100</p>
                          <p>Sales</p>
                          <p>It gauges the efficiency with which the company can generate a given level of profits out of its sales activities.</p>
                           <ul>
                          <li><em>Rate of Stock Turnover</em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>This is an activity ratio that shows the number of times that stock is converted into sales on the average. It is calculated by dividing the cost of sales by the average stock held during the year.</p>

                          <p>Rate of stock turnover = <em>   <u>            </u></em><u>Cost of sales______________</u> = _____ times</p>
                          <p>(<u>Opening stock + closing stock</u> )</p>
                          <p>2</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Debtors ratio</em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>This is another activity ratio that shows the average credit period allowed to debtors.</p>
                          <p>Debtors ratio = __<u>Debtors    </u>   X   365 = ______________     days</p>
                          <p>Sales</p>

                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Creditors ratio</em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Like the debtors ratio, the creditors ratio shows the average credit period allowed by creditors.</p>
                          <p>Creditors ratio =<u>    creditors___</u>   X   365   =   ________________ days</p>
                          <p>Purchases</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Net profit margin </em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>It gauges the company‚Äôs overall efficiency. It is given by:</p>
                          <p><u>Net Profit √ó taxes</u>   X 100</p>
                          <p>Sales</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><em>Return on capital employed </em></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>It gauges the managements efficiency in utilising the capital employed.</p>
                          <p>The computation       
                            <!-- Continuing from Return on capital employed in module11.html -->
                            is thus: <u>Net profit before taxes__</u>X  100</p>
                                            <p>Total capital employed</p>
