          <p>Small scale enterprises play a major role in the development of a country‚Äôs economy. Small enterprises create many jobs, provide a variety of goods and services, contribute a lot of revenue and promote the use of locally available resources.</p>
          <p>This sub-module unit introduces the concept of entrepreneurship and its importance in the promotion of the national development of a country and the differences between self and salaried employment.</p>
          <h3>Terms used in entrepreneurship</h3>

          <h4>i) Entrepreneurship</h4>
          <p>The term entrepreneurship has been described by different people in different ways.</p>
          <p>Entrepreneurship is the process of scanning the environment in order to identify a business opportunity, gathering resources with the aim of establishing a profit making enterprise, under conditions of risk.</p>
          <p>The concept of entrepreneurship became clear due to the researches by scientists like McClelland(1969) who stressed need for achievement motive, Schumpeter(  ) who prioritized new combinations of means of production   by which there occurs disequilibrium, Cantillon (  )  who emphasized the functions of risk taking and uncertainty bearing, Drucker who stressed  on ‚Äòsystematic innovation‚Äô consisting purposeful and organized search for changes among other scholars.</p>
        <!-- Continue with other h4 subsections like ii) Entrepreneur, iii) Intrapreneurship, etc. -->
          <h4>ii) Entrepreneur</h4>
        <p>The term entrepreneur is coined from a French verb ‚Äòentreprendre‚Äô which means to undertake. Various scholars have defined the term entrepreneur in different ways but all place emphasis on the entrepreneur;</p>
        <ol>
        <li> Bringing innovation and creativity into the enterprise.</li>
        <li>Taking calculated and moderate risks and</li>
        <li>Facing uncertainties</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An entrepreneur is someone who detects a previously untapped opportunity to make some profits (either by lowering the costs of producing the existing goods /services or by creating new ways for people to satisfy their needs or wants through new products). They then brings together the necessary factors of production to exploit these opportunities.</p>
        <p>Richard Cantillon defines an entrepreneur as a person who buys factor services at ‚Äúcertain‚Äù prices, with a view to sell their product at ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù prices in the future.</p>
        <p>David McClelland defines an entrepreneur as a person with a  high need for achievement, someone who has control over the means of production and produces more than they can consume in order to sell (or exchange) it for income.</p>
        <p>Joseph Schumpeter defines an entrepreneur as a person who carries out new combinations of means of production within an organization, while distorting the routine of the existing products/services, to set up new products and services.</p>

        <h4>iii) Intrapreneurship</h4>
        <p>It is the practice of entrepreneurship by employees within an organisation. Intrapreneurship is a novel way of making organisations more profitable where imaginative employees entertain entrepreneurial thoughts. It is a significant method for companies to reinvent themselves and improve performance.</p>

        <h4>iv) Intrapreneur</h4>
        <p>An intrapreneur is an employee who uses entrepreneurial skills to generate profits for the venture they works for.</p>

        <h4>v) An enterprise</h4>
        <p>It is a business organisation that provides goods and services to make profits and has growth potential.</p>
        <p>A business enterprise is a legally recognised organisation designed to provide goods and/ or services to consumers.</p>

        <h4>vi) Business person</h4>
        <p>A person who undertakes any business activity for the purpose of making profit</p>
        <p><strong>Difference between self employment and salaried employment </strong></p>

        <h4>Self employment</h4>
        <p>Self employment is a situation in which a person starts and operates a business enterprise. Since entrepreneurial skills drive people into self employment, entrepreneurship training is therefore expected to prepare trainees for starting and operating their enterprises effectively.</p>
        <p>Self employment is a situation in which individuals create and run/operate their own income generating activities.</p>
         <h4>Salaried employment</h4>
        <p>Salaried employment is a process in which an individual is hired for a period of time, which may range from a few months to a few years, and is paid a given amount of money as salary or wages for the work done.</p>
        <p>The merits and demerits of salaried employment are varied and largely depend on a person‚Äôs qualification, experience and specialisation area. The merits and demerits are also determined by the magnitude of growth, investment ability, profit and government support of a given organisation.</p>
        <p>Defined working hours, guaranteed income, delegation of duties and specialisation are some of the main advantages of being in salaried employment. However, salaried employment is affected largely by organisational elements such as change of management, especially where new management introduces new policies, rules, conditions of employment and other statutory requirements to the organisation. Job security is not guaranteed and personal satisfaction and motivation is not wholly experienced.</p>
        <p><strong>Contribution of Entrepreneurship to National Development </strong></p>
        <p>Entrepreneurship is the process that creates people (entrepreneurs) who contribute to economic development in various ways. The contributions are made through:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Stimulating indigenous entrepreneurship and technological development.</li>
        <li>Creating jobs for themselves and other people</li>
        <li>creating wealth and distributing income</li>
        <li>Utilising locally available resources</li>
        <li>Dispersal and diversification of economic activities and mobilisation of savings.</li>
        <li>Promotion of entrepreneurial culture i.e. they become models to be imitated by potential entrepreneurs because of successful images already potrayed by existing entrepreneurs.</li>
        <li>Increasing regional business activities through the export of manufactured goods.</li>
        <li>Promotion of indigenous/local technology e.g. use of jua kali technology.</li>
        <li>Raising the economic productivity level.</li>
        <li>Narrowing the ‚Äúmissing middle gap‚Äù</li>
        </ol>
