               <p>Starting a business requires knowledge, skills, abilities and values. It is therefore important for entrepreneurs to develop viable business ideas by identifying community needs for products and services.</p>

                <h3>Meaning of business opportunity</h3>
                 <p><strong>A business opportunity</strong> is an attractive idea which provides the possibility of a return for the entrepreneur taking the risk.

                  <h3>Characteristics of a good business opportunity </h3>
                  <p>A good business opportunity must fulfil or be capable of meeting the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Real demand i.e. it should respond to unsatisfied needs or requirements of customers who have ability to purchase and are willing to exercise that choice.</li>
                  <li>Return on investment ‚Äì provide durable, timely and acceptable returns or rewards for the risk and effort required.</li>
                  <li>Competitive ‚Äì Equal to or better ‚Äì from the viewpoint of the customer ‚Äì than other available products or services.</li>
                  <li>Meet objectives ‚Äì meet the goals and aspirations of the person taking the risk</li>
                  <li>Available resources and competencies ‚Äì be within the reach of the entrepreneur in terms of resource, competency, legal requirements etc.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Ways of Generating business ideas</h3>
                    <p><strong>What is a Business Idea</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>An opportunity in the environment which, can be translated into a business activity.</li>
                    <li>The existence of a situation in the environment which, can be advantageously turned into a business activity.</li>
                    <li>The existence of an opportunity which can be exploited for making money through the operation of business activities.</li>
                    <li>It is the response of a person (s) or organisation to solving an identified problem or to meeting perceived needs in the environment (markets, community)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why search and evaluate business ideas?</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>You need a great idea to start a new business. A good business idea is essential for successful business venture both when starting a business and to stay competitive afterwards</li>
                    <li>Business ideas need to respond to market needs. Customers have needs/wants waiting to be satisfied. Firms that are able to satisfy these requirements are rewarded.</li>
                    <li>Business ideas need to respond to changing consumer wants and needs. i.e. provide opportunities for the  entrepreneur to respond to demand with new ideas , products/services</li>
                    <li>Business ideas help entrepreneurs stay ahead of competition. Challenge is to be different or better than others. If you don‚Äôt come up with new ideas products/services a competitor will.</li>
                    <li>Business ideas use technology to do things better. Technology has become the major competitive tool in today‚Äôs markets as a result of which many people have to come up with new ideas.</li>
                    <li>Business ideas are needed because the life cycles of products are limited. Products have a finite life, they become obsolete or outdated. Firms have to introduce new products</li>
                    <li>Business ideas help to ensure that businesses operate effectively and efficiently .</li>
                    <li>There are so many business opportunities available at any one time and the requirements for translating them into business activities differ between each of them.</li>
                    <li>The need to develop a competitive edge by providing something new that has little or no competition</li>
                    <li>The success and profitability differ between various business opportunities, hence need to pick one with profit and success potential.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finding a good idea is the first step into transforming the entrepreneurs desire and creativity into a business opportunity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sources of business ideas</strong></p>

                    <p>Check out whether the business has a competitive edge over other competitors e.g. potential constraints and if the industry faces existing entry barriers.</p>
                    <ol start= "6" type= "i">
                    <li>Resources</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Availability and access of these resources determines whether certain opportunities can be pursued.</p>
                    <ol start="7" type= "i">
                    <li>Environment</li>
                    </ol>

                    </ol>
