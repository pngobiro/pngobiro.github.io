          <p>Marketing is an important aspect of business management. It is through marketing that a business creates awareness about its products. An entrepreneur must endeavour to create awareness and interest to customers about the products that his/her business deals with.</p>
          <p>This sub-module unit deals with definition of the terms market and marketing, components of marketing and methods of gathering market information</p>

          <p>A <em>market</em> refers to conditions that bring sellers and buyers together. This may be a physical location or any other medium such as electronic or print. A market can also be a group of consumers or an organisation that are interested in a product, have the resources to purchase the product, and is permitted by law and other regulations to acquire the product. The market definition begins with the total population and progressively narrows as shown in the following diagram.</p>

          <p><em>Marketing</em> refers to the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods and services from the seller to the consumer. It is an integrated process through which businesses create value for customers and build strong customer relationships in order to capture value from customers in return.</p>
          <p>Marketing is used to identify the customer, to keep the customer and to satisfy the customer. With the customer as the focus of its activities, it can be concluded that marketing management is one of the major components of business management.</p>

          <h3>Components of marketing.</h3>
            <p>Market components are commonly referred to as marketing mix. Marketing mix consists of the following components:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>i) Product</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Product refers to tangible, phyical products or services that a business offers for sale. During the product design and development, an entrepreneur must make decisions pertaining to the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Brand name</li>
            <li>Functionality</li>
            <li>Styling</li>
            <li>Quality</li>
            <li>Safety</li>
            <li>Packaging</li>
            <li>Repairs and Support</li>
            <li>Warranty</li>
            <li>Accessories and services</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>ii) Place/ Distribution</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Place refers to the actual location where the product is to be sold. It includes the activities that make the product available to target consumers. In this case, an entrepreneur must make decisions pertaining to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Distribution channels</li>
            <li>Market coverage (inclusive, selective, or exclusive distribution)</li>
            <li>Specific channel members</li>
            <li>Inventory management</li>
            <li>Warehousing</li>
            <li>Distribution centers</li>
            <li>Order processing</li>
            <li>Transportation</li>
            <li>Reverse logistics</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>iii)        Price</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Price is the unit value attached to a product i.e. the amount of money that customers have to pay to obtain the product. The entrepreneur in this regard must make decisions in relation to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Pricing strategy (skim, penetration, etc.)</li>
            <li>Suggested retail price</li>
            <li>Volume discounts and wholesale pricing</li>
            <li>Cash and early payment discounts</li>
            <li>Seasonal pricing</li>
            <li>Bundling</li>
            <li>Price flexibility</li>
            <li>Price discrimination</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start= "4">
            <li><strong>iv) Promotion</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Promotion is the process of letting buyers know about a product, how it is made, its benefits, cost, and quality among others.</p>
            <p>It constitutes the activities that communicate the benefits of the product and persuade target customers to buy it. The marketing communication decisions include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Promotional strategy (push, pull, etc.)</li>
            <li>Advertising</li>
            <li>Personal selling & sales force</li>
            <li>Sales promotions</li>
            <li>Public relations & publicity</li>
            <li>Marketing communications budget</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Limitations of the Marketing Mix Framework </strong></p>
          <p>The marketing mix framework was particularly useful in the early days of the marketing concept when physical products represented a larger portion of the economy. Today, with marketing more integrated into organisations and with a wider variety of products and markets, some authors have attempted to extend its usefulness by proposing other P, such as people, process and physical evidence.</p>
          <p><strong>People </strong></p>
          <p>This refers to the consumers for whom the goods and services are intended. There are various considerations made about the consumers in determining the suitability of the market mix to be used. (Figure. 12.1)</p>

            <!--Image for Marketing Mix Elements-->
           <img src="../assets/images/module12-marketing-mix.png" alt="Diagram of the marketing mix, showing Product, Price, Place, Promotion, and People." width="600" height="300">


          <p>An effective marketing program puts together all the marketing mix elements.</p>
            <p><strong>The other extended components of marketing mix include the following:</strong></p>
            <p>PROCESS</p>
            <p>Refers to the systems used to assist the organisation in delivering the service. Imagine you walk into Burger King and you order a Whopper Meal and you get it delivered within 2 minutes. What was the process that allowed you to obtain an efficient service delivery? Banks that send out Credit Cards automatically when their customers old one has expired again require an efficient process to identify expiry dates and renewal. An efficient service that replaces old credit cards will foster consumer loyalty and confidence in the company.</p>

            <p><strong>PHYSICAL EVIDENCE</strong></p>
            <p>Where is the service being delivered? Physical Evidence is the element of the service mix which allows the consumer again to make judgments on the organisation. If you walk into a restaurant your expectations are of a clean, friendly environment. On an aircraft if you travel first class you expect enough room to be able to lay down!<br />
            Physical evidence is an essential ingredient of the service mix, consumers will make perceptions based on their sight of the service provision which will have an impact on the organisations perceptual plan of the service.</p>

            <h4>THE MARKETING PROCESS</h4>
            <p>Under the marketing concept, the firm must find a way to discover unfulfilled customer needs and bring to market products that satisfy those needs. The process of doing so can be modeled in a sequence of steps: the situation is analyzed to identify opportunities, the strategy is formulated for a value proposition, tactical decisions are made, the plan is implemented and the results are monitored.</p>
            <p><strong>The Marketing Process</strong></p>
            <p><em>Image Here</em></p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong> SITUATION ANALYSIS</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>A thorough analysis of the situation in which the firm finds itself serves as the basis for identifying opportunities to satisfy unfulfilled customer needs. In addition to identifying the customer needs, the firm must understand its own capabilities and the environment in which it is operating.</p>

            <p>The situation analysis thus can be viewed in terms an analysis of the external environment and an internal analysis of the firm itself.</p>
            <p>The situation analysis should include past, present, and future aspects. It should include a history outlining how the situation evolved to its present state, and an analysis of trends in order to forecast where it is going. .</p>
            <p>If the situation analysis reveals gaps between what consumers want and what currently is offered to them, then there may be opportunities to introduce products to better satisfy those consumers. Hence, the situation analysis should yield a summary of problems and opportunities. From this summary, the firm can match its own capabilities with the opportunities in order to satisfy customer needs better than the competition.</p>
            <p>The two common frameworks  used to do the situation analysis:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> PEST analysis ‚Äì for macro-environmental political, economic, societal, and technological factors. A PEST analysis can be used as the ‚Äúclimate‚Äù portion of the 5 C framework.</li>
            <li>SWOT analysis ‚Äì strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats ‚Äì for the internal and external situation. A SWOT analysis can be used to condense the situation analysis into a listing of the most relevant problems and opportunities and to assess how well the firm is equipped to deal with them.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start= "2">
            <li><strong> MARKETING STRATEGY</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once the best opportunity to satisfy unfulfilled customer needs is identified, a strategic plan for pursuing the opportunity can be developed. Market research will provide specific market information that will permit the firm to select the target market segment and optimally position the offering within that segment. The result is a value proposition to the target market. The marketing strategy then involves:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Segmentation</li>
            <li>Targeting (target market selection)</li>
            <li>Positioning the product within the target market</li>
            <li>Value proposition to the target market</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>III. MARKETING MIX DECISIONS</strong></p>
            <p>Detailed tactical decisions then are made for the controllable parameters of the marketing mix. The action items include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Product development ‚Äì specifying, designing, and producing the first units of the product.</li>
            <li>Pricing decisions</li>
            <li>Distribution contracts</li>
            <li>Promotional campaign development</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start= "4">
            <li><strong> IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTROL</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>At this point in the process, the marketing plan has been developed and the product has been launched. Given that few environments are static, the results of the marketing effort should be monitored closely. As the market changes, the marketing mix can be adjusted to accomodate the changes. Often, small changes in consumer wants can addressed by changing the advertising message. As the changes become more significant, a product redesign or an entirely new product may be needed. The marketing process does not end with implementation ‚Äì continual monitoring and adaptation is needed to fulfill customer needs consistently over the long-term.</p>

             <h3>Ways of gathering market information</h3>
            <p>Market information can be gathered through:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>i) Asking customers.</li>
            <li>ii) Reading relevant materials e.g. business pamphlets.</li>

              <li>ii)<strong> Focusing on the customer needs or satisfaction</strong></li>
              </ol>
              <p>iii)        The need for meeting quality standards (KEBS)</p>
              <ol>
              <li>iv) The need to address environmental standards (NEMA)</li>
