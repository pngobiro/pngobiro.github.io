<!-- Continuing from Business Enterprise Management in module10.html -->
in order to come up with decisions that are practical. These decisions involve the utilisation of business resources so as to achieve organisational goals.</p>
<p>This chapter will introduce to the trainees the basic functions of management such as planning, organising and controlling for effective and efficient utilisation of business resources.</p>

<h3>Definition of the term management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Doing things through others</li>
<li>Activities carried out by an organisation to achieve its objectives</li>
<li>Planning, directing and controlling available resources to meet the desired results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions of management in an enterprise </h3>
<p>Management is necessary because resources are scarce and factors such as employees , technology costs keep changing.</p>
<p>Effectiveness is the ability to obtain the intended results, while efficiency is accomplishing the objectives by utilising minimum resources.</p>
<p>Management functions involve planning, organising, coordinating, controlling and directing a business.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Planning </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Planning is necessary for commitment of organisation resources. It involves deciding in advance the actions to be taken, when and how. Planning involves setting of objectives and goals to be achieved and deciding which activities should be carried out to achieve them. In planning the manager needs to involve the other employees to get their commitment in achieving the set objectives.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organising </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A manager must delegate tasks to others since he cannot do everything. These employees must have the resources to be able to perform tasks effectively. The manager is therefore responsible for organising people and resources in a manner that facilitates achievement of organisations objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directing </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Directing is influencing other people towards achieving organisation goals. It involves guiding, leading, supervising and motivating others to achieve set targets and deadlines.</p>

<ol start= "4">
<li><strong>Controlling </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Controlling involves checking the progress made towards the desired goal and correcting deviations that may occur. The manager must try to measure and evaluate the work of all individuals and groups to make sure that they are on target.</p>

<ol start= "5">
<li><strong>Coordinating </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Coordinating involves working together. A manager must coordinate the various departments in the organisation to ensure smooth running of organisation activities. This can be done through regular meetings.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Leadership/motivation </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Leadership involves directing human resource for optimum contribution. A good leader works with his staff as a team. As a team leader the manager must motivate his staff and take care of them. He should be able to tap and fully exploit the potential of those he leads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision Making </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All the management functions discussed above involve decision making. The manager should make sound decisions for the smooth flow of the business. Not all decisions made in a business have equal importance.</p>
 <p><strong>Decisions can be divided into:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strategic decision ‚Äì </strong>These are very important decisions that can affect the overall success of the business. These are rarely taken (made) and could include: future plans, change of status, long term investment etc.</li>
 <li><strong>Tactical decision ‚Äì </strong>These are taken more frequently and are less important. They could include: ways of training staff, methods of advertising, types of machine to purchase etc. these decisions can be made by middle management.</li>
<li><strong>Operational ‚Äì </strong>These are day to day decisions taken by lower level management. Examples include: staffing levels, stocking levels, methods of delivery of goods etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Qualities of a good manager </h3>
<p>To be a good manager one should have the following qualities</p>
<ol>
<li>Intelligence ‚Äì to enable him understand difficult ideas and deal with varied issues.</li>
<li>Initiative ‚Äì to enable him get solutions to problems and take control of situations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Self confidence ‚Äì to be able to lead others and set an example</li>
</ul>
<ol start ="4">
<li>Communication skills ‚Äì to clearly pass ideas to others to enable them to respond positively</li>
<li>Energy and enthusiasm ‚Äì to set high standards of effort and involvement to encourage others to follow his example.</li>
</ol>

 <h3>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT </h3>
<p>In many businesses, the cost of purchasing merchandise for resale(retailing) or the costs of purchasing and converting materialsinto finished products (manufacturing) represent the business‚Äôsmost significant expenditures. Keeping track of merchandise andmaterials, known as inventory, is important because of theconsiderable costs involved. This can be accomplished through agood inventory record keeping system.</p>
<p><strong>Inventory Record Keeping</strong></p>

  <p>Inventory record keeping establishes and maintains information oncurrent inventory, the additions and withdrawals to inventory andinventory balances at the end of specified periods (week, month,etc.). These records identify the products/materials, thequantities and the value (cost) of these products/materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Inventory Strategies</strong></p>
  <p>Every business competes within an industry and each industry hasa life cycle. The strategies employed by the business depend onwhere in the life cycle the industry is. The management ofinventories is influenced by this life cycle.Generally, there are four stages in the life cycle of an</p>

  <p>*  Development ‚Äì Uniquely new products are being developed and market tested. Products must be available for market  testing. There is little concern about inventory</p>
  <p>investment, other than to be sure products are available</p>
  <p>for market testing and development.</p>
  <p>*  Growth ‚Äì The product has been demonstrated to have</p>
  <p>significant market potential and the business strives to</p>
  <p>gain a major market share. Investment in inventory is heavy</p>
  <p>to ensure product availability to gain significant market</p>
    <p>share.</p>

    <p>*  Maturity ‚Äì Growth has leveled off. Inventories are very</p>
    <p>closely controlled to keep investment in them just</p>
    <p>sufficient to maintain market share.</p>

    <p>*  Aging ‚Äì A period of retrenchment as competitive industries</p>
    <p>take away or eliminate markets. Inventories decline as</p>
    <p>unprofitable and marginally profitable segments of the</p>
    <p>business are weeded out.</p>

    <p>The proper control of inventories is essential to the success of</p>
    <p>any business in which investment in inventories is significant.</p>
    <p>Awareness of the competition and the state of new product</p>
     <p>development is just as important as a finely honed record-keeping</p>
    <p>system. While the record-keeping system is important, how it is</p>
    <p>applied will determine the success of the business.</p>

     <h3>MANAGING BUSINESS RESOURCES</h3>
    <h4>MANAGING EMPLOYEES</h4>
    <p>One of the keys to successful businesses is the employment and retention of the right people. However the employment of staff also brings with it legal obligations, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Provision of a safe working place as per the Occupational Health and Safety Act;</li>
    <li>The need to have a policy dealing with discrimination and harassment in the workplace;  and</li>
    <li>Payment of minimum wages and provision of conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Employment Conditions</strong></p>
    <p>All employers have certain legal obligations to their employees, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>paying correct wages;</li>
    <li>ensuring a safe working environment;</li>
    <li>supporting an anti-discriminatory and anti-harassment workplace;</li>
    <li>taking out workers compensation insurance;</li>
    <li>paying superannuation contributions;</li>
    <li>paying a range of employee-related taxes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Employees may be entitled to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a range of leave entitlements;</li>
    <li>notice of termination and severance pay;</li>
    <li>protection from unfair dismissal or unlawful termination.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All employers in Kenya are required to comply with, and exhibit a copy of, all relevant awards applicable to their workplace.</p>
    <p>To motivate and retain staff:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Try to pay staff electronically or by cheque ‚Äì avoid cash.</li>
    <li>Introduce staff incentives that encourage sales.</li>
    <li>Acknowledge staff performance and encourage good working morale.</li>
    <li>Determine the reason for staff turnover, if applicable.</li>
    <li>Identify training needs of staff and encourage ongoing learning.</li>
    <li>Be aware of occupational health and safety (OH&S) issues and have risk management policies and processes in place.</li>
    <li>Ensure that staff and clients have facilities that will enhance relationships and satisfaction levels.</li>
    <li>Review the decor and layout of your premises to ensure that you are conveying the most professional and appealing image to clients.</li>
    </ul>
     <h4>Personnel Selection</h4>
    <p>If your business will be large enough to require outside help, an important responsibility will be the selection and training of one or more employees. You may start out with family members or business partners to help you. But if the business grows ‚Äì as you hope it will ‚Äì the time will come when you must select and train personnel.</p>
    <p>Careful choice of personnel is essential. To select the right employees determine beforehand what you want each one to do.</p>
    <p>Then look for applicants to fill these particular needs. In a small business you will need flexible employees who can shift from task to task as required. Include this in the description of the jobs you wish to fill. At the same time, look ahead and plan your hiring to assure an organization of individuals capable of performing every essential function. In a retail store, a salesperson may also do stock keeping or bookkeeping at the outset, but as the business grows you will need sales people, stock keepers and bookkeepers.</p>
    <p>Once the job descriptions are written, line up applicants from whom to make a selection. Do not be swayed by customers who may suggest relatives. If the applicant does not succeed, you may lose a customer as well as an employee.</p>
    <p>Some sources of possible new employees are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Recommendations by friends, business acquaintances.</li>
    <li>Employment agencies.</li>
    <li>Placement bureaus of high schools, business schools, and colleges.</li>
    <li>Trade and industrial associations.</li>
    <li>Help-wanted ads in local newspapers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your next task is to screen want ad responses and/or application forms sent by employment agencies. Some applicants will be eliminated sight unseen. For each of the others, the application form or letter will serve as a basis for the interview which should be conducted in private. Put the applicant at ease by describing your business in general and the job in particular. Once you have done this, encourage the applicant to talk. Selecting the right person is extremely important. Ask your questions carefully to find out everything about the applicant that is pertinent to the job.</p>
     <p>References are a must, and should be checked before making a final decision. Check through a personal visit or a phone call directly to the applicant‚Äôs immediate former supervisor, if possible. Verify that the information given you is correct. Consider, with judgment, any negative comments you hear and what is not said.</p>
    <p>Checking references can bring to light significant information which may save you money and future inconvenience.</p>
    <h4>Personnel Training</h4>
     <p>A well-selected employee is only a potential asset to your business. Whether or not he or she becomes a real asset depends upon your training. Remember:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>To allow sufficient time for training.</li>
      <li>Not to expect too much from the trainee in too short a time.</li>
      <li>To let the employee learn by performing under actual working conditions, with close supervision.</li>
      <li>To follow up on your training.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check the employee‚Äôs performance after he or she has been at work for a time. Re-explain key points and short cuts; bring the employee up to date on new developments and encourage questions. Training is a continuous process which becomes constructive supervision.</p>

     <h4>Personnel Supervision</h4>
    <p>Supervision is the third essential of personnel control. Good supervision will reduce the cost of operating your business by cutting down on the number of employee errors. If errors are corrected early, employees will get more satisfaction from their jobs and perform better.</p>
    <h4>Motivating Employees</h4>
      <p>Small businesses sometimes face special problems in motivating employees. In a large company, a good employee can see an opportunity to advance into management. In a small company, you are the management. One thing you may wish to consider is to give good employees a small share of the profits, either through part ownership or a profit-sharing plan. Someone who has a ‚Äúshare of the action‚Äù is going to be more concerned about helping to make a success of the business.</p>
      <p>Simpler ways of motivating employees include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce staff incentives that encourage sales.</li>
        <li>Acknowledge staff performance and encourage good working morale.</li>
        <li>Determine the reason for staff turnover, if applicable.</li>
        <li>Identify training needs of staff and encourage ongoing learning.</li>
        <li>Be aware of occupational health and safety (OH&S) issues and have risk management policies and processes in place.</li>
        <li>Ensure that staff and clients have facilities that will enhance relationships and satisfaction levels.</li>
        <li>Review the decor and layout of your premises to ensure that you are conveying the most professional and appealing image to clients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>MANAGING CAPITAL</h4>
          <p>Cash shortages can prevent you from meeting your financial obligations and make it difficult to expand your business.  In some cases it will mean you will need to close your business. It is important to know your cash flow position.  To manage your cash flow, take note of the following tips.</p>
          <p><strong>Account for Every Shilling and Cent</strong></p>
          <ul>
          <li>Install an accounting system that produces relevant financial reports and meets tax requirements.</li>
          <li>Keep your financial records and bookkeeping up to date.</li>
          <li>Use the information in your accounting system to draw up a budget and cash flow forecast.</li>

          <li>Consider offering discounts for cash sales or early payments of credit purchases.</li>
          <li>Consider alternatives to improve your sales terms, eg lay-by terms, payment terms, credit terms.</li>
          <li>Keep a detailed list of amounts that you owe.  Your debts may build up without your knowing.</li>

          </ul>

           <h4>MANAGING TIME</h4>
