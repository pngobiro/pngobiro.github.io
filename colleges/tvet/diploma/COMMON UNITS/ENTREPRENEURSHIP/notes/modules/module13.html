          <p><u>Social responsibility</u> consists of those obligations a business has to society. It also involves specific responsibilities and responsiveness to society. This requires obligation of businessmen to pursue those enterprise policies to make those decisions or to follow those lines of action which are desirable in terms of objectives and values to society.</p>
          <p>Social responsibility refers to the fact that businesses should not just be concerned with profit maximisation but should do so in a socially responsible manner. This responsibility requires the management of the business to consider the social and economic effects of their decisions on society. Businesses should therefore pursue profit maximisation within acceptable moral limits.</p>
           <h3>Business ethics</h3>
          <p>Ethics concerns the rules and principles that define right and wrong good and bad conduct. Ethics also deals with moral ability and obligations.</p>
          <p>Business ethics is also called management ethics and it is the application of ethical principles to business relationships and activities.</p>
          <p>Statt (1999,19) sees business ethics as the application of ethical concerns to the world of business and has three areas of concern namely;</p>
          <ol>
          <li><em>Code of Ethics </em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Where a company has explicit guidelines for the members about what constitutes acceptable behaviour to stakeholders like staff or customers</p>
          <ol start ="2">
          <li><em>Changes in the board of directors </em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>To include people from outside the business world who reflect broader interests.</p>
          <ol start= "3">
          <li><em>Social responsibility </em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>By a company in the marketing of its goods and services, The entrepreneurs and employees have ethical responsibilities or obligations which are placed on them by virtue of the positions they occupy in the organisation.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Entrepreneurs should adhere to high ethical standards e.g. dealing fairly honestly and responsibly with his employees and other stakeholders</li>
          <li>Employees are expected to exhibit the same high ethical standard of behaviour that will affect the company‚Äôs image financially and economically.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ENTERPRISE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </h3>
          <ul>
          <li>The business operators have a responsibility to protect and improve society and their actions should not in any way endanger a community or society.</li>
          <li>They should display high degree of corporate responsiveness which is the ability of an organisation to relate its operations and policies to the environment in ways that are mutually beneficial to the organisation and the society.</li>
          <li>Every enterprise small or large is expected to make positive contribution</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
          <li>To the community development</li>
          <li>Product safety</li>
          <li>Employment generation</li>
          <li>Ethical business practices</li>
          <li>Contribution towards educational activities like award of scholarships</li>
          <li>Creating opportunity for apprenticeship training etc</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
          <li>Undertaking some of these responsibilities may endear the entrepreneur to his host community to enhance his/her image and social standing thus contributing significantly to his business success.</li>
          <li>Every business has a social responsibility to contribute to the development of the society in which it operates. This social responsibility can be carried out in various ways such as</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
          <li>Supporting and contributing towards environmental conservation programmes</li>
          <li>Ensuring that the goods and services produced and sold to the people are safe for human consumption</li>
          <li>Ensuring that workplace is safe and secure for workers</li>
          <li>Ensuring that the activities of the business do not cause environmental pollution or harmful effects to the surrounding community.</li>
          <li>Supporting and contributing towards social welfare programmes such as contributing towards the care of orphans. , HIV/AIDs victims and flood victims.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Businesses have a duty to obey the laws of the countries in which they operate and also to fulfil their contracts. Businesses are also a part of society and therefore they have a responsibility to maintain healthy and safe surrounding.</p>
          <p>This is done by;</p>
          <ol>
          <li>i) reducing air and water pollution by applying appropriate waste disposal methods</li>
          <li>ii) packaging goods in environmentally friendly materials e.g. the polythene bags used for carrying goods   from the supermarkets or the shops do not decompose. They therefore make the environment very untidy   and unhealthy especially in towns.</li>
          <li>Keeping the business premises and work place clean at all times.</li>
          <li>Preserving the surrounding natural vegetation as much as possible</li>
          <li>Producing goods and services that are safe to use. These may be sold to consumers when safe especially when handling and using.</li>
          </ol>

           <p>In conclusion therefore, is the implied obligation of the business acting in its official capacity to serve or protect the interests of community other than itself only?</p>
           <h3>TYPES OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES </h3>
            <p>Social responsibility can be put into three main categories.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>social obligation</li>
            <li>social reaction</li>
            <li>social responsiveness</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>social obligation </strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on the fact that society supports a business by allowing it to exist, the business has a duty to supply the society with quality goods and services.</p>

            <p>It should carry out its activities and make profit `within the limits of the law.</p>
            <ol start= "2">
            <li><strong>social reaction</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>A business can sometimes be under pressure from society to do certain things. As such, the response of business gives/shows is referred to as a social reaction because the business is reacting to social pressure. This social reaction is not a voluntary action on the part of the business.</p>
            <p>It is a behaviour demanded by a group or groups of people who have a direct interest in the organisations actions. E.g. a business could be forced to withdraw offensive advertisements by the public through social pressure.</p>
            <ol start= "3">
            <li><strong>social responsiveness</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This refers to actions taken by a business voluntarily. These actions may be due to the anticipation of future needs of a society which the business tries to satisfy.</p>
            <p>A business that responds to the social needs will actively seek ways to solve social problems e.g. a business operating in a given locality may decide to employ some of the local people in order to reduce unemployment in the area.</p>

            <p>A business should be socially responsible</p>
            <p>Areas such as, to the customers by ensuring</p>

            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>TO NATURAL ENVIRONMENT </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A business should be socially responsible towards the environment by:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Recycling products ‚Äì some of the materials that pollute the environment if thrown away carelessly can be taken back to the factory for recycling. Such materials become raw materials when producing other products, e.g. used plastic materials can be reprocessed into pellets which in turn can be used for furniture or trays thereby creating a healthy environment.</li>
            <li>Reducing all types of pollution(noise, water, air etc.)</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li>Ways of reducing noise can be devised e.g. those operating in Jua kali castor may be supplied ear plugs</li>
            <li>Business in the manufacturing sector should get a way of getting rid of unwanted chemicals and other wastes instead of channelling them into rivers</li>
            <li>Businesses should devise proper ways of disposing their gabbage, such waste pollutes the environment when disposed carelessly and it may breed flies especially during rainy seasons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‚Äì           However where effluent from factories must be channelled into the river then it needs to be treated first.</p>
              <p>‚Äì           used water by business operators if put back into the rivers is a threat to life of water creatures like fish and also unsafe for human consumption.</p>
            <p>e.g. Nairobi river has suffered such pollution as a result of passing through an area that has both manufacturing and service industries.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance of Enterprise Social Responsibility </strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>A marketing tool</li>
            <li>Conducive atmosphere for the success of the business</li>
            <li>Environmental conservation programmes</li>
            <li>Ensures security for workers</li>
            <li>Social welfare programmes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Social Responsibility </strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>It leads to creation of a better social environment both for the society and the business</li>
            <li>It improves the value of the business shares on the stock exchange</li>
            <li>It improves the image of the business to the public</li>
            <li>It makes the business follow government regulations</li>
            <li>It makes business live up to the social expectations</li>
            <li>Such social actions are profitable to the business in the future</li>
            <li>The business can develop new measures from which the society benefits</li>
            <li></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Limitations of Social Responsibility </strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>It increases costs to the business</li>
            <li>It makes the business to spend resources and thus reduces profit</li>
            <li>Increased social responsibility cost is passed onto the consumers in form of higher prices</li>
            <li>Most businesses lack the skills to solve social problems</li>
            <li>The business might misuse its powers on the society</li>
            <li>The business may deviate from its main purpose of existence</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR IN A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE </h3>
                <p>Ethics refers to prescribed or accepted code of conduct. For a business to run smoothly there must be rules and regulations that govern the behaviour of each and every employee.</p>
                <p>These rules could either be written implied or naturally accepted especially if they affect the moral standards.</p>

                <p><strong>The Role of Ethics in Business</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Encouraging good working relationships among workers</li>
                <li>Ensuring good working relationship between employer and employee</li>
                <li>Ensuring rights of individuals in working environment are protected e.g. a doctor is expected to treat and not kill</li>
                <li>Ensuring that professionals relate professionally to their clients e.g. counsellor and their client</li>
                <li>Helping workers to protect and hold a good reputation</li>
                <li>Helping the workers to develop proper skills and right attitude towards their work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>‚Äì           The business set up and operations should be such that they provide ample facilities and opportunities for each employee too practice the business ethics. For example, it would be very difficult for an employee to uphold business ethics if the management mistreats him/her.</p>

                <p>NB: Business ethics is not the same as social responsibility because social responsibility refers to relationship between organisations and the society around.</p>
                 <p>While ethics refers to set values and principles which influence how individual groups of people and society in general behave.</p>

                 <p>‚Äì Business  ethics deals with how such values and principles affect business operations. Business ethics therefore guides the business in ensuring fair play in business operations.</p>
                 <p><strong>Need For Ethic Issues in Business </strong></p>

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Creates fairness in competition </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Business ethics ensures that there is fair play as business firms compete with each other. e.g. It would be unethical to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Buy competitors products and destroy them before they reach the market</li>
                <li>Discredit competitors products with a view to reducing their sales</li>
                <li>Damage the competitors promotional materials such as bill boards</li>
                </ul>

                <ol start="2">
                <li><strong>Ensures no discrimination in business </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Business ethics ensures that there is no discrimination in areas such as recruitment, promotion training, remuneration, and assignment of duties. Everybody should therefore be equal opportunity or equal chance regardless of set of ethnicity.</p>
                <ol start="3">
                <li><strong>Ensures protection of the environment </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ethics in business prohibits business units from carrying out activities that may cause pollution and degradation of the environment.</p>

                <p>Environment degradation may be caused by human activities such as logging and unplanned cultivation.</p>

                <p>Pollution may be caused by activities like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Dumping effluents from production units into water masses thus causing water pollution. This is disastrous to human health and animal.</li>
                <li>Emitting carbon dioxide and other gases into atmosphere causing air pollution.</li>
                <li>Damping of waste materials on the land surface causing solid waste pollution.
                <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Avoid consumer exploitation</strong></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ethics ensures that consumers are not exploited by the business through:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Overcharging</li>
                <li>False advertisement</li>
                <li>Selling poor quality goods and services</li>
                <li>Selling wrong quantities</li>
                <li>Selling harmful commodities
                <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Ensures fair play in competition </strong></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ethics ensures that businesses do not engage in unfair practices while competing with others. These practices include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Destroying a competitor‚Äôs product or promotional tools such as billboards</li>
                <li>Buying and destroying competitors products before they reach the market</li>
                <li>Giving false information about a competitor‚Äôs product</li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>Ensures rights of employees are upheld </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ethics ensures that the employer does not violate the rights of employees especially as laid out in terms and conditions of employment. Such rights include payment of dues in time.</p>
                <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Eliminates use of unfair means of achieving business objectives </strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ethics ensures that business operations are carried out in a professional way. For example it is unethical to give or receive a bribe in order to win a business contract. It is also unethical to hold goods awaiting for their prices to go up.</p>

                <h3>UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES </h3>
                <p>The question of ethical business practice is a widely debatable subject.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Profit and morality are incompatible. For instance the pursuit of wealth is a barometer of success yet it is popularly believed that wealth tends to corrupt individuals.</li>
                <li>All ethical problems have simple solutions i.e. right or wrong. This is a misconception based on the assumption that there is an absolute standard for judging moral conduct.</li>
                <li>Ethics is simply a matter of compliance with laws and regulations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite these misconceptions, unethical behaviour is inherent in many entrepreneurs. This happens because of:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Greed</li>
                <li>Inability to distinguish activities at work and at home</li>
                <li>Survivalist thinking</li>
                <li>Lack of foundation in the study of ethics etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, some studies on ethical practices have shown that entrepreneurs have different concerns regarding specific business issues. Etc.</p>

                          <p><strong>Example of Mary‚Äôs Successful Business that has Benefited Community </strong></p>
                          <p>Mary is forty years old. She currently lives in Thika. Mary came to Thika when she was young. Her father worked as a cook in a restaurant. She attended Secondary School. After graduating, she did not qualify for college, but she was admitted at a Technical Institute where she enrolled in a two ‚Äìyear course in tailoring. On completion of her course, she was employed by a tailoring company in the Industrial Area of Thika.</p>
                          <p>She worked for this company for two years. Then she decided to start her own business. She obtained a loan from a commercial bank as capital for the business. From her savings, she contributed additional capital.</p>
                          <p>Mary then rented a room in the shopping centre nearest her house so that she could walk to work. She bought 4 sewing machines. She bought cloth and then employed 4 skilled tailors to do the cutting and sewing of the clothes. At first she made dresses, trousers and shirts. She displayed the products in her shop for customers to come and buy them. Later Mary visited several shops in the city square that sell uniforms in quantities. Two businesses placed orders with her to supply uniforms. To be able to meet this order, she needed to employ 5 skilled employees‚Äô full time and 2 employees on part time basis. She also needed to buy three more sewing machines. Mary was able to meet her orders and her customers were satisfied with the products.</p>
                          <p>As Marys business expanded, she needed additional space. She rented a bigger room in a popular place in town. She was also nearer to her prospective customers as well as her existing customers. She continued supplying uniforms to two same companies and at the same time made clothes to sell to other customers. At this juncture she needed to employ an account clerk to deal with the records and handle cash for the business, and a messenger to do errands. Mary was the overall manager.</p>
                           <p>Mary organised exhibitions in Nairobi to advertise her products both to local customers and to customers in foreign markets. Soon after the first two exhibitions, she started exporting some of her products to neighbouring countries. Her net income rose quickly.</p>

                            <p>Mary is friendly to her customers. They like her because of her quality products and her honesty. Her employees also like her and are loyal and committed to their work. Five of her employees have worked in the business for over ten years. The employees and the customers have nicknamed her ‚Äúfashion‚Äù. She like the name and has accepted it. Mary pays her employees reasonably well. She has also organised an insurance scheme for them. She pays them a travel allowance in addition to their monthly salaries.</p>
