          <p>Entrepreneurship was introduced by the economists of the eighteen century, and it continued to attract the interest of economists in the nineteenth century. In the present century the world has become synonymous or at least closely linked with free enterprise and capitalism. Also it is generally recognised that entrepreneurs serve as agents of change, provide creativity innovative ideas for business enterprises and help businesses grow and become profitable.</p>

          <h3>HISTORY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP GLOBALLY AND IN KENYA</h3>

          <h4><em>History of entrepreneurship globally </em></h4>
          <p>Entrepreneurship has been part of human history since records began. The bible, in the old testament, raises the idea of stewardship with regard to utility resources of the earth.( Gen. 2.15)The bible also in the new testament, reveals that  gain requires risk (the parable of talents) (Luke 17.11)</p>
          <p>Entrepreneurship is also closely linked to the protestant work ethics and capitalists</p>
          <p>(Weber 1995)</p>
          <p>Early economists in the 18<sup>th</sup>c such as Richard Cantilon and Jean Baptiste  Say  recognized  in the role of  the entrepreneur as essential to the progress of the world economic system  8 developed  early economic theories  on entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p>During the industrial revolution entrepreneurship was linked to the  creation of wealth and prosperity (long 1983)</p>
          <p>The 1920s and Schumpeter (1934)linked entrepreneurship with the dynamic  process on innovation  from the 1960s  entrepreneurial SME (s)   have played an increasingly significant role  in the economic development of the world  (Kirzner 1973)</p>
          <p>From the 1980s  government have increasingly seen  entrepreneurship as a means of creating innovative technology and services which can increase , national competitiveness fosters economic growth and  employment (stoner and Freeman1992)  Commentators suggests that two main reasons for the ascend reccefs of high   tech .</p>
           <p>Entrepreneurial SME(s)  are the difficulty of the large organizations to grow  and prosper in an increasingly  competitive  market  place .</p>
           <p>Consequently, 8<sup>th</sup> need to decentralize  despecialize and downsize the  operations (Harrell 1992) In construst in the 1980s those high growth new ventures   (SME(s))  known as  ‚Äúgazelles‚Äô  represents only  5% of new business due, but were responsible for as much as  87% of all new jobs   created (Zimmbrer&Scarbrough  1996) in the UK in the 1980s  small businesses generated more than  805% OF UNP and more than 40% of employment , more than 80 Employment growth came from newly started  companies (Burns and Dewhurst  1989)  This development has accentuated  during the 1990s and today entrepreneurs help in high on the political agenda world wide.</p>

          <h4>History of Entrepreneurship in Kenya </h4>
          <p>In Kenya the concept of entrepreneurship was embraced at the end of the 1980‚Äôs and early 1990.  This was as a result of the international labour organisation (ILO) working in conjunction with the governments and private sector institutions in the projects related to SME development and vocational education.  Entrepreneurship education was seen as an important element to develop entrepreneurial attitudes.  However, no specific trainings were available.</p>
           <p>To close this gap, funds were provided by ILO Geneva in 1996, to develop a training package for TIVET Institutions; that included entrepreneurship education and business skills.</p>

          <p>History of entrepreneurship in Kenya started as a pioneer project borne out of the collaboration among university of Illinois, International Labour Organisation (ILO), UNDP and KTTC, in 1990.  It was offered at Masters and PhD levels by the University of Illinois and KTTC provided the premises and conducive learning environment.  In 1992 the program was transferred to Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) while at KTTC started its first higher diploma class   in 1993.  The first class was sponsored by ILO.  Since 1995 students have been paying fees on  their   own without sponsorship. Otherwise it was, and still is a popular course. satisfaction especially with those students who have been attached and  apprenticed at their organisations.</p>
          <p><strong>Myths associated with entrepreneurship in Kenya </strong></p>
          <p>The following are some of the myths associated with entrepreneurship:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Entrepreneurs take wild risks at the start of their business.</strong> Even though risk is an integral part of business, the start of business is not considered the highest risk. An entrepreneur is more likely to face bigger risks at the latter stage of the business.</li>
          <li><strong>Entrepreneurs introduce break-through inventions in their start-up business.</strong> It would be easy to assume that entrepreneurs introduce new inventions, usually technological inventions. This is not true. Innovation may be important, but what makes entrepreneurship successful is the ability to execute an ordinary idea exceptionally.</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Most successful entrepreneurs have years of experience in their chosen line of business.</strong> Bill Gates was still a student when he started Microsoft with Paul Allen. This story of several inexperienced entrepreneurs starting out a new business venture is replicated over and over again in the lives of millions of other successful entrepreneurs.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>One needs a lot of money to start a business.</strong> This is not so. Money is not always an important prerequisite to be able to start a business. What sets the successful entrepreneur apart from the not-so-successful is the ability to make do with what little he or she has. For instance, they look for other sources of money such as borrowing to grow their business.</li>
          <li><strong>Start-ups use equity, not debt money</strong>. Entrepreneurs who put up equity coming from their own pocket only comprise less than 50% of the total start-ups. The majority of the companies are financed by debt.</li>
          </ol>
           <p><strong>Theories of entrepreneurship </strong></p>
           <p>These refer to the various approaches, which have been advanced to give an explanation as to why entrepreneurs behave the way they do. They are also known as the perspectives of entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p>The theories try to explain whether entrepreneurs are born or made. The born entrepreneurs inherit the entrepreneurial behaviour from their parents and grandparents while made entrepreneurs acquire entrepreneurial behaviour from the behaviour in which they live in.</p>

            <p>The following are some of the entrepreneurial theories:</p>

            <h4><em>Economic theory </em></h4>
            <p>The theory holds that entrepreneurial behaviour is determined by economic factors. Thus entrepreneurs are greatly influenced by economic activities. From an economic point of view an entrepreneur  is a person who brings together the factors of production into a combination to make their value greater than before.</p>
            <p>According to Schumpeter, entrepreneurs are innovators who bring together the various resources to produce a new product/service through new ways/methods of production, finding new markets, finding new sources of materials to create a new business.</p>

           <p>The economic theory provides basic data in the economic environment ‚Äì activities for business start-ups. Thus entrepreneurial activities take place where conditions are supportive/conducive to investment. This theory revolves around an entrepreneur being an innovator, combining the various resources/ factors of production to create new products/wealth.</p>
            <h4><em>Psychological theory  </em></h4>
            <p>The theory holds that entrepreneurs possess unique needs, values and attributes, which drive them into entrepreneurial behaviour. It holds that people have personal traits and attributes, mental desires to be independent.</p>
            <p>The main proponent of this theory is McClelland who attributed entrepreneurial behaviour to the high need for achievement. Entrepreneurs are characterised by high need for achievement, which tends to give them high desire to take personal responsibility in risks. They have little interest in routine activities, which are not challenging. According to this theory, entrepreneurial behaviour is environmentally determined and is inherent during childhood, where parents have certain high standards achievement.</p>

            <h4><em>Sociological theory </em></h4>
            <p>The sociological theory maintains that environmental factors such as values and beliefs influence entrepreneurial behaviour. (Max Weber, 1904). According too this theory, beliefs and societal aspects such as social status and recognition influence entrepreneurial behaviour.</p>

             <p><strong>Importance of Entrepreneurship theories </strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Entrepreneurship theories bring greater understanding of entrepreneurship behaviour exhibited by different entrepreneurs.</li>
            <li>They enable one to understand the need for entrepreneurship and why some people are more entrepreneurial than others.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            <li>The theories bring out various approaches and perceptions held by entrepreneurs.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
            <li>Show that the desire for entrepreneurship is innate as well as environmentally determined.</li>
            <li>Helps us to understand the role played by role models through networks that provide support.</li>
            </ol>

              <p><strong>Entrepreneurial Environment </strong></p>
              <p>The environment within which the business operate has a great influence on the attractiveness of any opportunity. By business environment, we are referring not only to the physical environment, which is important and increasingly so, but also the political, economic, geographical, legal and regulatory contexts. Political instability, for example, renders business opportunities unattractive in many countries, especially for ventures requiring high investment with a long payback period. Similarly, inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, or a week judiciary system, are not a good environment to start a business, even if the potential returns are high. The lack of infrastructure and services (such as roads, electricity, water supply, telecommunications, transportation, and even schools and hospitals) also affect the attractiveness of an opportunity in a given environment.</p>
