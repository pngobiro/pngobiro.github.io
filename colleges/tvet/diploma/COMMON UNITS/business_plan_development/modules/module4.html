            <span class="heading-text">How does Potential Lenders and Investors Evaluate the Plan</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Potential readers or evaluators should reflect on the strengths of management and personnel, the product or service and the available resources. Suppliers who may want to see a business plan before signing a contract together with customers who may want to see the business plan before buying the product or service and the available resources. Suppliers who may want to see a business plan before signing a contract together with customers who may want to see the business plan before buying the products pay more attention to the experience of the entrepreneur, Market projections. Lenders will primarily be interest in the ability of the new venture to pay back the debt of together with the interest within a designated period of time. Banks want facts with an objective analysis of the business opportunity and all the potential risks associated with a business. Lenders forcus on the 4cs of credit i.e</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cash flow</li>
            <li>Collateral</li>
            <li>Character</li>
            <li>Contribution of equity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The business plan must therefore reflect the entrepreneurs credit history, the ability of the entrepreneur to meet the debt and the interest payable ( cash flow) the collateral or tangible assets being secured for the loan and the amount of personal equity the entrepreneur has invested in the business. Investors on the other hand place more emphasis on the enterprenuers character then lenders. Investors want to make sure that the entrepreneur is complaint and willing to accept this involvement. They also demand a high rate of returns and will therefore focus on the market and financial projections. In preparing a business plan it is important for the entrepreneurs to consider the needs of external sources and not merely provide their own perspective.</p>

            <span class="heading-text">Presenting the Business Plan</span>
          </h3>
          <p>It is often necessary for an entrepreneur to orally present the business plan before and audience of potential investors ‚Äì in this case the entrepreneur is expected to provide a short presentation of the business plan. The entrepreneurs are expected to sell their business concept in this short period ‚Äì try and persuade potential investors that his is a good investment. The focus of such presentation is why this is a good opportunity ‚Äì an overview of the marketing program. Concluding remarks might reflect the recognized risks and how the entrepreneur plans to address them.</p>
          <p>Unlike oral presentation ‚Äìwritten presentation requires the entrepreneur to consult where necessary the services of lawyers <a href="https://masomomsingi.com/kasneb-certified-public-accountants-cpa-revision-kits-question-and-answer/">accountants</a>, marketing consults and engineers in preparation of the business plan. The plan must give a detailed account of the needs of the expected readers.</p>
