            <li>Travel trends and</li>
            <li>Employment trends<br>
              The next step is to assess the trends in the national food service industry- here the points of interest would be;</li>
            <li>Total food sales</li>
            <li>The commercial restaurant sales e.t.c.</li>
            <li>This first two stages focuses on the national market and the located</li>
            <li>This consists of the general local economic trends and as assessment of the local food industry</li>
            <li>The final step is an analysis of the local competitive environment by analyzing each competitors strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Once this analysis is completed, the entrepreneur is ready to clarify the product of service he/she would offer, the actual market positioning in the competitive environment and the market objectives ‚Äì in order to form the marketing plan.</li>
