          <h2 class="section-heading">PERIOD OF MANAGERIAL AWAKENING</h2>
          <p>The period around 18<sup>th</sup> century industrial revolution of management took a more defined direction as the study was geared towards maximizing production. Pioneers of this period include: ‚Äì</p>
          <ol>

          </ol>

          <p>He felt that science and mathematical methods should be used in operations of factories.</p>
          <p>He advocated for</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Factories should have data/information which is obtained through research</li>
            <li>Determine the precise cost of every process</li>
            <li>Paying workers fairly and bonus when the produce is high to motivate</li>
