          <p><strong>Control</strong> is that function of management that involves monitoring, measurement and correcting performance of employees and other organizational resources according to the plan.</p>
          <p>The aim of control is to develop a feedback and to establish any deviations from the plan so as to take corrective action.</p>
          <p>Importance of Control:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>To ensure that resources are optimally utilized</li>
            <li>To ensure the organization objectives are met</li>
            <li>It limits accumulation of error as they are corrected on time</li>

                <li><em>Measurement of actual performance</em> - The actual performance is measured against the set standard. That is comparing the performance with the standards.</li>
                <li><em>Compare the performance</em> - Deviation/gaps from the expected standards are established through comparing the results and the expected performance.</li>
                <li><em>Taking corrective action</em> - This implies taking a remedial action in order to bring back actual results in the line with the standards. This may involve review of the plan/standards or putting in place steps to prevent deviations.</li

          <h2 class="section-heading">TYPES OF CONTROL BUDGETARY CONTROL</h2>
          <p>A budget is a plan expressed in numerical terms for a specific period of time in future. There are several types of budgets. They include:-</p>
          <div class="content-card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <ul>
                <li>Sales budget ‚Äì this shows the volume of sales expected</li>
                <li>Production budgets ‚Äì shows the quantity and quality of goods to produced</li>

                <li>Labour budgets ‚Äì labour requirements</li>
                <li>Capital expenditure budgets ‚Äì capital investment in assets</li>
                <li>Overhead budget ‚Äì shows the estimates of overhead costs expected</li>
                <li>Master budget ‚Äìshows the expected expenditure for the whole</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Budgetary control is therefore the process of defining desired performance through the preparation of budgets, measuring and comparing actual results with the corresponding budget data and taking appropriate actions to correct any deviations.</p>

            <li><em>BREAK EVEN ANALYSIS</em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Break-even analysis is frequently used in business and economics to analyze the implication of various pricing and production decisions. This is an important control device as it depicts the relationship between revenue and the total costs (fixed and variable). The break-even point is the point where the sales revenue is equal to the total costs.</p>
          <p>Therefore below the break-even point losses occur and above it profits occur. The fixed and the variable costs are also indicated.</p>

          <p>Personal observation is a very important control tool as it supplements the other control devices such as budgets, audits reports etc. a manager who sits in his office and depend only on the scientific devices hardly realizes a thorough job.</p>
          <p>Personal observation allows the manager a better involvement in all the operations of the organization.</p>
          <p>However, personal observation suffers the following limitations,</p>

            <li><em>AUDITING</em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Auditing can either be external or internal, external auditing is carried out by an external chattered accountant and is enforced by law in respect to all joint stock companies and cooperatives. It ensures that the stakeholders and any interested parties are safe guarded against any manipulations and malpractices of management. The external out for certifies that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet of the firm gives a true and fair picture of profit or loss and the picture of Financial state of affairs of the company respectively.</p>
          <p>For internal audits and a member of staff is appointed specifically for this function in the organization to verify all financial transactions and records and also analyze the overall control system in the organization.</p>

            <li><em>REPORTS (Special)</em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Some complex operations in the organization require special analysis and reporting. This system of control can help supplement other control techniques especially where routine accounting and statistical reports falls to give adequate information.</p>
