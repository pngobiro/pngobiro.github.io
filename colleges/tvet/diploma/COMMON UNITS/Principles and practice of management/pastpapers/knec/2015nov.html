                                <li><strong>Time-Consuming:</strong> Setting and agreeing upon objectives requires significant time and effort from both managers and subordinates.</li>

                                <li><strong>Potential for Conflict:</strong> Divisions might compete for resources or pursue conflicting goals, hindering overall organizational objectives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Loss of Economies of Scale:</strong> Functional specialization across the entire organization might offer greater economies of scale than duplicating functions within divisions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Difficulty in Finding/Developing General Managers:</strong> Requires capable managers who can oversee all functional aspects within a product division.</li>

                            <h5>(a) Limitations of Using Money as a Motivator:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Temporary Effect:</strong> The motivational impact often diminishes over time as employees adapt to the higher pay level (Hedonic Adaptation).</li>
                                <li><strong>Diminishing Marginal Utility:</strong> Beyond a certain income level, additional money provides less satisfaction and motivation compared to other factors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Equity Concerns:</strong> Perceived unfairness in how monetary rewards are distributed can lead to demotivation, resentment, and conflict.</li>
                                <li><strong>Neglect of Intrinsic Motivation:</strong> Over-reliance on money can overshadow intrinsic motivators like achievement, recognition, interesting work, and personal growth.</li>
                                <li><strong>Entitlement Mentality:</strong> Employees may come to expect regular monetary rewards regardless of performance, reducing their incentive value.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(b) Reasons for Recommending a Price Change (Bass Ltd):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Changes in Production/Input Costs:</strong> An increase in raw material, labor, or manufacturing costs might necessitate a price increase to maintain profit margins.</li>
                                <li><strong>Competitor Pricing Strategies:</strong> Responding to price changes by competitors (either matching cuts to remain competitive or increasing prices if competitors do).</li>
                                <li><strong>Changes in Market Demand:</strong> Increasing prices if demand is high and supply is limited, or decreasing prices to stimulate demand if it's low.</li>
                                <li><strong>Product Life Cycle Stage:</strong> Adjusting price based on the product's stage (e.g., skimming price at introduction, competitive pricing at maturity, price cuts during decline).</li>
                                <li><strong>Strategic Objectives/Positioning:</strong> Changing price to align with a new strategy, such as penetrating a new market (lower price) or repositioning as a premium brand (higher price).</li>
                                <li><strong>Economic Conditions:</strong> Responding to broader economic factors like inflation (requiring price increases) or recession (potentially requiring price cuts).</li>
