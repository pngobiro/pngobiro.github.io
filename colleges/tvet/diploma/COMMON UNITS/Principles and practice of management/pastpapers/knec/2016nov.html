                                <li><strong>Employee Demotivation & Unethical Behavior:</strong> Unfair, unclear, or overly punitive control systems can lower morale, while lack of controls might encourage unethical actions.</li>

                                <li><strong>Complexity of Work:</strong> More complex, varied, and non-routine tasks require closer supervision, thus a narrower span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Subordinate Training & Experience:</strong> Highly trained, experienced, and self-motivated subordinates require less supervision, allowing a wider span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Manager's Abilities & Workload:</strong> More capable and experienced managers can handle wider spans; a heavy workload limits the span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Degree of Interaction Required:</strong> Jobs needing frequent communication and interaction between manager and subordinates necessitate a narrower span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clarity of Plans & Procedures:</strong> Well-defined goals, clear instructions, and standardized procedures enable wider spans.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geographical Dispersion:</strong> Subordinates located far apart geographically usually require a narrower span.</li>
