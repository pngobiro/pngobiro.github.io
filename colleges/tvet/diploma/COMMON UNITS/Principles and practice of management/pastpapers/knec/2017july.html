                                <li><strong>Improved Morale & Motivation:</strong> Provides clear career progression paths, motivating existing employees and fostering loyalty.</li>
                                <li><strong>Better Assessment of Candidates:</strong> Performance records, skills, potential, and cultural fit are already known, reducing hiring risks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Generally cheaper than external recruitment (less advertising, agency fees, extensive onboarding).</li>
                                <li><strong>Faster Process:</strong> Quicker to identify, assess, and place internal candidates already familiar with the organization.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Orientation/Training Time:</strong> Internal hires require less time to become productive as they know the company's policies, culture, and processes.</li>

                                <li><strong>No Universal Traits Identified:</strong> Research has failed to identify a consistent set of traits that guarantee leadership success across all situations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ignores Situational Factors:</strong> The theory largely overlooks the crucial importance of the context, followers' characteristics, and the nature of the task in determining leadership effectiveness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Subjectivity in Trait Identification & Measurement:</strong> Identifying and accurately measuring abstract leadership traits (like integrity or charisma) can be subjective and difficult.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cause vs. Effect Uncertainty:</strong> It's unclear whether possessing certain traits makes someone a leader or if the experience of leading develops those traits.</li>
