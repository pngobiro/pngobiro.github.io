                                <li><strong>Authoritarian Perception:</strong> Can be seen as overly controlling, creating a divide between managers (thinkers) and workers (doers), potentially causing resistance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ignores Group Dynamics:</strong> Fails to recognize the influence of informal groups and social interactions on worker behavior and productivity.</li>

                                <li><strong>Complexity of Subordinates' Work:</strong> More complex, non-routine tasks require closer supervision, favoring a narrower span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Subordinates' Skills & Experience:</strong> Highly skilled, experienced, and self-reliant employees need less direct supervision, allowing for a wider span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Manager's Capabilities & Workload:</strong> More experienced and capable managers can handle wider spans, but their own workload (non-supervisory tasks) limits the span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Degree of Interaction Required:</strong> Jobs requiring frequent communication and interaction between manager and subordinates necessitate a narrower span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clarity of Plans & Procedures:</strong> Well-defined goals, clear instructions, standardized procedures, and objective performance measures enable wider spans.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geographical Dispersion:</strong> If subordinates are physically dispersed, managing them requires more effort, favoring a narrower span.</li>
                                <li><strong>Level of Support for Manager:</strong> Availability of administrative assistance or support systems can allow for a wider span.</li>

                                <li><strong>Establish Standards:</strong> Define clear, measurable performance standards or benchmarks based on organizational goals and plans. (What should performance be?)</li>
                                <li><strong>Measure Actual Performance:</strong> Collect data on actual performance related to the established standards using appropriate methods (e.g., reports, observation). (What is performance?)</li>
                                <li><strong>Compare Performance Against Standards:</strong> Analyze the measured performance against the predetermined standards to identify any significant deviations (variances). (Is there a difference?)</li>
                                <li><strong>Take Corrective Action:</strong> Implement actions to correct significant negative deviations and bring performance back in line with standards. This might involve changing activities, reallocating resources, or revising the standard itself if it proves unrealistic. (What should be done about it?)</li>
