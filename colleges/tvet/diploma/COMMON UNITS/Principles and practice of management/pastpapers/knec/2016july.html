                            <h5>(a) Benefits of Bureaucratic Principles (Weber):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Efficiency & Speed:</strong> Specialization and clear procedures can enhance speed and efficiency for routine tasks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Consistency & Predictability:</strong> Standardized rules ensure tasks are performed uniformly, leading to predictable outcomes and fair treatment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rationality:</strong> Decisions are based on rules and logic, reducing subjectivity, bias, and emotional influence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clear Authority & Accountability:</strong> The hierarchical structure clearly defines who is responsible for what and who reports to whom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technical Competence:</strong> Emphasis on qualifications and expertise for positions ensures competence in roles.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(b) Precautions When Using Selection Tests:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Validity:</strong> Ensure the test accurately measures what it claims to measure and is relevant to job performance (e.g., content validity, criterion-related validity).</li>
                                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Ensure the test yields consistent results over time and across different administrations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Administer and score the test under uniform conditions for all applicants to ensure fairness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Job Relevance:</strong> Use tests that assess skills, knowledge, or abilities directly required for successful job performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> Ensure the test does not unfairly discriminate against any protected group and complies with equal employment opportunity laws. Use multiple selection methods, not just tests.</li>

                            <h5>(a) Challenges of Management by Objectives (MBO):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Time-Consuming:</strong> The process of setting mutually agreed-upon objectives can be lengthy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Overemphasis on Quantifiable Goals:</strong> May neglect important qualitative aspects of performance or long-term objectives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Potential for Conflict:</strong> Disagreements between managers and subordinates during goal setting or appraisal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rigidity/Inflexibility:</strong> Objectives set for a period might become unsuitable if the environment changes rapidly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Increased Paperwork:</strong> Can generate significant documentation and administrative overhead.</li>
                                <li><strong>"Tug of War":</strong> Subordinates might try to set easily achievable goals, while managers push for challenging ones.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Methodology Issues:</strong> The critical incident technique used is prone to bias (people attribute satisfaction to themselves and dissatisfaction to external factors).</li>
                                <li><strong>Oversimplification:</strong> The strict separation of factors into 'hygiene' and 'motivators' may not reflect reality; some factors can act as both.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ignores Individual Differences:</strong> Assumes all employees react similarly to hygiene factors and motivators, neglecting individual preferences and values.</li>
                                <li><strong>Job Satisfaction vs. Productivity Link:</strong> The theory primarily links factors to job satisfaction, but the link between satisfaction and actual productivity is not always direct or strong.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limited Sample:</strong> Original research was primarily based on accountants and engineers, potentially limiting generalizability to other occupations.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Workforce Instability & Scheduling Difficulties:</strong> Difficulty in maintaining consistent staffing levels, team cohesion, and predictable scheduling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Potential Legal & Compliance Risks:</strong> Risk of misclassification, violating labor laws regarding benefits, pay, or working conditions for casual staff.</li>
