            <p>~~Some people may use leisure to tempt others and to lead others astray. People become drug addicts through the influence of others especially through peer pressure.</p>
            <p>~~If a person spends all the income on leisure activities such as drinking and gambling. A person may also spend all the time outside the family living no time for the family i.e. time and money are spend outside the family is wrong.</p>

            <p>~~Leisure activities that cause physical harm to the body are wrong e.g. alcoholism. When a person is drunk they weak less and can engage in risk sexual behaviors which can lead to STIs, HIV and AIDS and pregnancy. They can also engage in criminal activities.
