                                <p><strong>Description of a Pure Germanium (Ge) Atom:</strong></p>
                                <p>A pure germanium atom is a semiconductor element found in Group 14 of the periodic table. Its atomic structure is key to its electrical properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> Germanium has an atomic number of 32, meaning its nucleus contains 32 protons. A neutral atom also has 32 electrons orbiting the nucleus.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electron Shells:</strong> These 32 electrons are arranged in specific energy levels or shells. The configuration is typically 2 electrons in the first shell, 8 in the second, 18 in the third, and 4 in the outermost (valence) shell.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Valence Electrons:</strong> The crucial feature is the 4 electrons in the valence shell. These electrons are relatively loosely bound and are involved in chemical bonding and electrical conduction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonding:</strong> In a pure germanium crystal, each atom forms covalent bonds with four neighboring atoms. Each atom shares one of its valence electrons with each neighbor, effectively filling its valence shell to a stable 8 electrons (octet rule).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Semiconductor Nature:</strong> At absolute zero temperature, these valence electrons are tightly bound, and pure germanium acts as an insulator. However, at room temperature, thermal energy is sufficient to break some covalent bonds, freeing electrons to move and conduct electricity, leaving behind "holes" (vacancies) that can also contribute to current flow. This ability to conduct electricity under certain conditions defines it as a semiconductor.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Sketch Description (as a sketch cannot be directly embedded here):</strong></p>
                                <p>A sketch would typically show a central nucleus labelled "Ge" or "+32". Concentric circles would represent electron shells. The innermost circle would have 2 dots (electrons), the next 8 dots, the next 18 dots, and the outermost (valence) shell would show 4 dots. Often, diagrams simplify this to just show the nucleus and the 4 valence electrons, sometimes with lines indicating potential covalent bonds to neighboring atoms.</p>

                                <p>A nibble (or nybble) is a unit of digital information equal to 4 bits, which is half of a standard 8-bit byte.</p>
                                <p>Two applications of nibbles in computers include:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Representing Hexadecimal Digits:</strong> A single hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F) can represent values from 0 to 15. Since $2^4 = 16$, exactly 4 bits (one nibble) are required to represent one hexadecimal digit. This makes conversions between binary and hexadecimal straightforward, as each nibble in a binary number corresponds directly to one hex digit. This is useful in low-level programming, memory addressing, and data representation. For example, the byte `1110 0101` can be easily read as `E5` in hexadecimal by considering each nibble separately.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Representation:</strong> BCD is a system where each decimal digit (0-9) is encoded using a fixed number of bits, typically 4 (a nibble). For example, the decimal number 97 would be represented in BCD as `1001 0111`, where `1001` is the nibble for 9 and `0111` is the nibble for 7. While less space-efficient than pure binary, BCD simplifies arithmetic operations involving decimal numbers, particularly in financial and commercial applications where exact decimal representation and rounding are critical. Early computers and calculators often used BCD extensively.</li>

                                <p>The question asks to simplify the BCD arithmetic $0001000000000111 / 0101$.</p>
                                <p>First, interpret the BCD numbers:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dividend: $0001 \, 0000 \, 0000 \, 0111$ represents the decimal number $1007$. (Each 4-bit group is a decimal digit).</li>
                                    <li>Divisor: $0101$ represents the decimal number $5$.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The problem is equivalent to performing the decimal division $1007 \div 5$.</p>
                                <p>Performing the division:</p>
                                $$ 1007 \div 5 = 201 \text{ with a remainder of } 2 $$
                                <p>Or, as a decimal fraction: $1007 \div 5 = 201.4$</p>
                                <p>The question asks to "simplify the BCD arithmetic", which usually implies performing the operation and representing the result in BCD. However, BCD division is complex and not standardly defined in the same way as addition/subtraction. Often, BCD operations are handled by converting to binary or decimal, performing the operation, and then converting back if needed.</p>
                                <p>Assuming the goal is the decimal result:</p>
                                <p>The result is <strong>201 with a remainder of 2</strong>, or <strong>201.4</strong>.</p>
                                <p>If the result needed to be in BCD, it would be:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For 201: $0010 \, 0000 \, 0001$</li>
                                    <li>For the remainder 2: $0010$</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Note: The interpretation might differ if this refers to a specific BCD division algorithm not detailed here. However, converting to decimal and dividing is the most direct interpretation.</em> (4 marks)</p>

                                <p>Binary complements are primarily used to represent negative numbers in binary systems and simplify subtraction operations.</p>
                                <p>Two main types of binary complements are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>1's Complement (One's Complement):</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The 1's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits in the number. Each 0 becomes a 1, and each 1 becomes a 0.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> The 1's complement of the 8-bit binary number `01101001` is `10010110`.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> It was used in some older computers for signed number representation and arithmetic. Subtraction can be performed by adding the 1's complement of the subtrahend to the minuend (with an end-around carry adjustment).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Drawback:</strong> It has two representations for zero: `00000000` (+0) and `11111111` (-0), which can complicate arithmetic logic.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>2's Complement (Two's Complement):</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The 2's complement of a binary number is obtained by first finding the 1's complement and then adding 1 to the result. Alternatively, starting from the rightmost bit, find the first '1', keep that bit and all subsequent zeros to its right unchanged, and invert all bits to the left of that first '1'.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> To find the 2's complement of `01101001`:
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>1's Complement: `10010110`</li>
                                                    <li>Add 1: `10010110 + 1 = 10010111`</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                So, the 2's complement is `10010111`.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> This is the most common method used in modern computers to represent signed integers and perform arithmetic. Subtraction is simplified to addition using the 2's complement of the subtrahend, without needing special adjustments like the end-around carry.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> It has only one representation for zero (`00000000`) and simplifies the hardware logic for arithmetic operations.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> LEDs convert a much higher percentage of electrical energy into visible light compared to incandescent bulbs (which lose most energy as heat) and even CFLs. This results in significantly lower power consumption for the same amount of light output, leading to energy savings.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> LEDs have a much longer operational lifespan (tens of thousands of hours) compared to incandescent bulbs (around 1,000 hours) and CFLs (around 8,000-15,000 hours). This reduces replacement frequency and maintenance costs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Relay Logic:</strong> An older method of implementing control systems using electromechanical relays. A relay uses an electromagnet to operate a switch. By connecting relays in specific configurations (series, parallel), logical functions (AND, OR, NOT) can be implemented to control processes based on input conditions. It was common before the advent of PLCs and solid-state electronics but is still used in some high-power or specific interface applications.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Integrated Circuit (IC):</strong> A miniaturized electronic circuit consisting of semiconductor devices (like transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors) fabricated on a small piece (chip) of semiconductor material (usually silicon).

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Two Reasons for Using DRAM as Primary Memory:</strong> (4 marks)</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>High Density:</strong> DRAM cells are structurally simple (typically one transistor and one capacitor per bit), allowing a very large number of memory cells to be packed into a small physical area on an IC chip. This leads to high-capacity memory modules at a reasonable cost.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Relatively Low Cost per Bit:</strong> Compared to Static RAM (SRAM), which is faster but uses more complex cells (typically 4-6 transistors per bit), DRAM offers a significantly lower cost per bit of storage, making it economically feasible for the large amounts of RAM required by modern computers.</li>
                                    <li><em>(Note: While DRAM is slower than SRAM, its density and cost advantages make it the preferred choice for main system memory, while faster SRAM is used for CPU caches.)</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Two Advantages of ROM Storage Media for Firmware:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Non-Volatility:</strong> ROM (Read-Only Memory) retains its stored information even when power is removed. This is essential for firmware (like the BIOS/UEFI in a computer), which needs to be available immediately when the device is turned on to initialize hardware and boot the system.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Security/Integrity:</strong> Since ROM is typically read-only or difficult to write to after manufacturing (depending on the specific type like PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash), the firmware stored on it is protected from accidental or malicious modification, ensuring the device's fundamental operating instructions remain intact.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(I) Determine the power dissipation ($P_D$):</strong></p>
                                $$ P_D = V_D \times I_D $$
                                $$ P_D = 1.4 \, \text{V} \times 1.75 \, \text{A} = 2.45 \, \text{W} $$
                                <p>The power dissipation is <strong>2.45 W</strong>.</p>
                                <p><strong>(II) Establish whether the diode will be destroyed:</strong></p>
                                <p>Compare the calculated power dissipation ($P_D$) with the diode's power rating ($P_{rating}$).</p>

                                <p>Since $P_D (2.45 \, \text{W}) < P_{rating} (10 \, \text{W})$, the power dissipated by the diode is less than its maximum rating. Therefore, the diode <strong>will not be destroyed</strong> under these operating conditions.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Two Power Sources of DC Circuits:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Batteries (Chemical Cells):</strong> Devices that convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions. They provide a relatively constant DC voltage. Examples include dry cells (like AA, AAA), lead-acid batteries (car batteries), and lithium-ion batteries.</li>
                                    <li><strong>DC Power Supplies (Rectified AC):</strong> Electronic circuits that convert AC voltage from the mains supply into a regulated DC voltage. They typically involve a transformer (to step down voltage), a rectifier (to convert AC to pulsating DC), a filter (to smooth the DC), and a regulator (to maintain a constant output voltage).</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Inaccurate Rating/Unreliability:</strong> The fusing current depends heavily on the gauge and type of fuse wire used, and how it's installed. Incorrect wire can lead to the fuse not blowing when it should (causing equipment damage) or blowing unnecessarily. The fusing characteristic can also degrade over time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Risk of Fire/Arcing:</strong> When the fuse wire melts, it can create a significant arc, especially under heavy fault currents. The enclosure might not safely contain this arc, posing a fire hazard.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Possibility of Incorrect Rewiring:</strong> Users might replace the fuse wire with an incorrect gauge or even a solid piece of wire, completely defeating the protective purpose of the fuse and creating a dangerous situation.</li>

                                <p>The Boolean expression (Sum of Products) is:</p>
                                $$ \text{Output} = \bar{A}BC + A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} + ABC $$
                                <p>This expression can be simplified using Boolean algebra or K-maps. Let's simplify:</p>
                                $$ = BC(\bar{A}+A) + AB(\bar{C}+C) $$  <!-- Incorrect simplification step shown for illustration, correct one below -->
                                <p>Correct Simplification:</p>
                                $$ = BC(\bar{A} + A) + AB\bar{C} + A\bar{B}C \quad \text{(Factoring out BC from 1st and 4th term)}$$

                                $$ = C(A+B) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                <p>Let's verify the last form: $C(A+B) + AB\bar{C} = AC + BC + AB\bar{C}$. This matches the K-map simplification which groups (011, 111), (101, 111), (110, 111) leading to $BC + AC + AB$.</p>
                                <p>Simplified Boolean Expression: <strong>$AB + BC + AC$</strong> (This represents a majority function - output is 1 if at least two inputs are 1).</p>

                                <p>A standard NOT gate has one input. To create a NOT gate using NAND gates, you tie the inputs of a single NAND gate together. The question asks for a construction using 3 NAND gates and implies two inputs (perhaps A and B, but only inverting one?). This is unusual. Assuming the goal is to invert input A using 3 NAND gates (which is inefficient):</p>

                                <p>If the intent was different (e.g., using two inputs A and B to somehow produce $\bar{A}$ or $\bar{B}$ using 3 gates), the question is ambiguous. The standard 1-input NOT implementation uses only one NAND gate with tied inputs.</p>
