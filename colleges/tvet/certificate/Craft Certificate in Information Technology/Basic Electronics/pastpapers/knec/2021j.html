                                <p>Gray code is a binary numeral system where consecutive values differ by only one bit. Four application areas include:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Position Encoders:</strong> Used in rotary and linear encoders to represent physical position digitally. The single-bit change property prevents errors during transitions between positions that could occur with standard binary encoding if multiple bits changed simultaneously.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Karnaugh Maps (K-maps):</strong> The ordering of rows and columns in K-maps used for Boolean logic simplification follows Gray code principles. This ensures that adjacent cells (representing adjacent input states) differ by only one variable, which facilitates visual grouping of terms for simplification.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Digital Communications/Error Correction:</strong> In some communication systems, using Gray code can minimize the effect of single-bit transmission errors, as such an error often results in a value numerically closer to the intended value than it might with standard binary.</li>
                                    <li><strong>State Machines and Digital Counters:</strong> In certain digital logic designs, using Gray code for state assignments can help prevent race conditions or glitches that might occur during state transitions if multiple state bits were changing at once.</li>

                                <p><strong>(i) Logic Gate:</strong></p>
                                <p>A logic gate is a fundamental building block of a digital circuit that performs a basic logical operation on one or more binary inputs (typically represented as 0 or 1, low or high voltage) to produce a single binary output. Common examples include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates, each implementing a specific Boolean function.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) 8421 BCD:</strong></p>
                                <p>8421 BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) is the most common type of BCD code. It is a weighted code where each decimal digit (0 through 9) is represented by its corresponding 4-bit binary equivalent. The weights of the four bit positions are 8, 4, 2, and 1 (reading from left to right, the same as standard binary place values). For example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Decimal 0 = BCD 0000</li>
                                    <li>Decimal 1 = BCD 0001</li>
                                    <li>Decimal 5 = BCD 0101 ($0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 5$)</li>
                                    <li>Decimal 9 = BCD 1001 ($1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 9$)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The 4-bit combinations 1010 through 1111 are unused/invalid in 8421 BCD as they don't correspond to single decimal digits.</p>

                                <p>A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into an electrical current. It is essentially a P-N junction designed to be sensitive to light. When photons of sufficient energy strike the junction, they can create electron-hole pairs. If the diode is reverse-biased, these charge carriers are swept across the junction by the electric field, producing a current proportional to the light intensity. Photodiodes are used in various applications like light detection, optical communication, barcode scanners, and medical imaging.</p>
                                <p><strong>Symbol:</strong></p>
                                <p>The schematic symbol for a photodiode is similar to a standard diode symbol (triangle pointing towards a bar), but with two arrows pointing towards the diode, indicating its sensitivity to incoming light.</p>

Data is stored magnetically in concentric tracks on these platters. A typical HDD contains multiple platters stacked on a central spindle.

                                        <strong>Read/Write Heads (on Actuator Arm):</strong> For each platter surface, there is a corresponding read/write head attached to the end of an actuator arm. These heads float extremely close to the platter surface (on a cushion of air generated by the spinning platters) without touching it. They are responsible for magnetizing (writing) or detecting the magnetic fields (reading) representing the data stored on the tracks as the platters rotate beneath them. The actuator arm, controlled by an actuator mechanism (usually a voice coil motor), moves the heads radially across the platters to access different tracks.

It has no net electric charge (it is neutral) and has a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. Neutrons, along with protons, contribute to the atomic mass number of an atom and play a role in nuclear stability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Conductivity ($\sigma$):</strong> An intrinsic property of a material measuring its ability to conduct electric current. It is the ratio of the current density (J) to the electric field strength (E) ($\sigma = J/E$) and is the reciprocal of resistivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$). Materials with high conductivity (like metals) allow current to flow easily, while materials with low conductivity (insulators) resist current flow. Measured in Siemens per meter (S/m).</li>

It represents the ratio of the induced voltage to the rate of change of current causing it ($V = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$). Inductance arises from the magnetic field generated by the current. Measured in Henries (H).</li>
                                    <li><strong>(iv) Impedance (Z):</strong> The total opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of alternating current (AC) at a specific frequency.

                                <p>Excess-3 code is a self-complementing BCD code, meaning the 9's complement of a decimal digit can be obtained by simply inverting the bits of its Excess-3 representation.</p>

                                        <strong>Self-Complementing Property:</strong> As mentioned, inverting the bits of an Excess-3 code word yields the Excess-3 code for the 9's complement of the original decimal digit. For example, Decimal 2 is 0101 in XS-3. Its 9's complement is 7, which is 1010 in XS-3. Inverting 0101 gives 1010. This property simplifies the hardware required for subtraction operations in BCD arithmetic, as subtraction can be performed by adding the 9's complement.

                                        <strong>No All-Zero or All-One Codes Used:</strong> The Excess-3 representations for decimal digits 0 through 9 (which are 0011 through 1100) do not include the patterns 0000 or 1111. This can be advantageous in detecting errors or certain circuit conditions, as the occurrence of 0000 or 1111 might indicate a fault. It also avoids potential ambiguity associated with these patterns in some logic systems.

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Depletion Layer of a P-N Junction:</strong></p>
                                <p>When p-type and n-type semiconductor materials are joined, free electrons from the n-side diffuse across the junction to the p-side, and holes from the p-side diffuse to the n-side. This diffusion happens due to the concentration gradient.</p>
                                <p>As electrons diffuse into the p-side, they recombine with holes near the junction. As holes diffuse into the n-side, they recombine with electrons near the junction. This recombination process eliminates free charge carriers in a narrow region on both sides of the junction.</p>
                                <p>The diffusion leaves behind uncovered positive ions (donor atoms) on the n-side and uncovered negative ions (acceptor atoms) on the p-side in this region near the junction. This region, depleted of free mobile charge carriers and containing fixed ions, is called the <strong>depletion layer</strong> or space charge region. An electric field (the built-in potential) forms across this layer, opposing further diffusion.</p>
                                <p><em>Diagram Description:</em> A diagram would show the p-type material (with circles representing holes and circled minus signs for acceptor ions) joined to the n-type material (with dots for electrons and circled plus signs for donor ions). The depletion layer would be a region straddling the junction, showing only the fixed ions (negative on the p-side, positive on the n-side) and no free carriers (holes or electrons). An arrow might indicate the direction of the built-in electric field from the n-side to the p-side.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Distinguish between Energy and Power:</strong> (3 marks)</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Energy (E or W):</strong> Represents the total capacity to do work. It is a quantity that is conserved. In electronics, it's the total amount of electrical work done or heat generated over a period. Measured in Joules (J) or often kilowatt-hours (kWh) for consumption.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Power (P):</strong> Represents the rate at which energy is transferred, consumed, or work is done. It measures how quickly energy is used. Measured in Watts (W), where 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Essentially, Energy = Power × Time.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Three Circumstances Necessitating Inductors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Inductors oppose changes in current. This property is used in LC (inductor-capacitor) or RL (resistor-inductor) filter circuits to smooth out pulsating DC (e.g., in power supplies after rectification) or to selectively pass or block signals of certain frequencies (e.g., in audio crossovers or RF tuning circuits).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Inductors store energy in their magnetic field when current flows through them. This stored energy can be released back into the circuit. This is fundamental to the operation of switch-mode power supplies (like buck or boost converters) where energy is temporarily stored in the inductor during one part of the switching cycle and released during another.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tuned Circuits / Oscillators:</strong> When combined with capacitors, inductors form resonant circuits (LC circuits) that oscillate at a specific frequency. These are essential in radio frequency (RF) applications for tuning transmitters and receivers to specific frequencies, and in creating oscillators that generate signals at a desired frequency.</li>
                                </ul>

Memory hierarchy has become more complex with multiple cache levels, different RAM types (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5), and various storage technologies coexisting.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Performance Improvements:</strong> Significant increases in memory speed and bandwidth through innovations like wider data buses, higher clock speeds, and improved interfaces.

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Limited Write Endurance:</strong> Flash memory cells can only undergo a finite number of write-erase cycles (typically 10,000 to 100,000 cycles) before becoming unreliable. This wear-out mechanism means flash memory devices have a limited lifespan, especially in applications with frequent writes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Write Speed Limitations:</strong> Writing to flash memory is significantly slower than reading from it because the write process requires erasing blocks of memory before new data can be written.
