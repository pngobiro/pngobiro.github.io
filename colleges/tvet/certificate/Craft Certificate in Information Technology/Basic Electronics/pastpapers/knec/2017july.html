<p><strong>(i) Electrode:</strong> An electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e.g., a semiconductor, an electrolyte, a vacuum, or air). In a voltaic cell, electrodes are the terminals where chemical reactions occur, leading to electron flow.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Voltaic Cell (Galvanic Cell):</strong> An electrochemical cell that converts chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions. It typically consists of two different metal electrodes immersed in an electrolyte (or separate electrolytes connected by a salt bridge), creating a potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes.</p>

<p>Two common methods used to encode decimal digits into Binary Coded Decimal (BCD):</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>8421 Code (Natural BCD):</strong> This is the most common method. Each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by its direct 4-bit weighted binary equivalent. The weights of the bits are 8, 4, 2, and 1, corresponding to the powers of 2 ($2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0$). For example, the decimal digit 7 is encoded as 0111 ($0 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 = 7$).</li>
    <li><strong>Excess-3 Code:</strong> This is an unweighted BCD code where each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent plus 3 (binary 0011). For example, the decimal digit 7 is encoded as $7+3=10$, which is $1010$ in binary. An advantage is that the 9's complement of an Excess-3 digit can be found by simply inverting its bits, which simplifies subtraction logic in some older systems.</li>

<p><strong>(i) Floating Point (as used in BCD):</strong> While standard BCD encodes integers, floating-point BCD is a representation for storing and processing decimal numbers with a fractional part, similar to scientific notation. It typically involves storing the sign, the significand (mantissa) as a series of BCD digits, and the exponent (representing the position of the decimal point) separately. This allows for a wide range of values, both very large and very small, while maintaining decimal precision, which is crucial for financial calculations where binary floating-point inaccuracies are unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Bit:</strong> A "bit" is the most fundamental unit of information in computing and digital communications. It represents a logical state with one of two possible values, typically denoted as 0 or 1. In the context of BCD, each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by a group of 4 bits.</p>

<p>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit must equal zero. This means the sum of voltage rises (from sources) must equal the sum of voltage drops (across components like resistors).</p>
<p>In Figure 1 (Q7):</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a voltage source providing a voltage rise, let's call it $V_S$.</li>
    <li>There are three resistors, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. Current $I$ flows through the circuit.</li>
    <li>According to Ohm's Law, there will be a voltage drop across each resistor: $V_1 = I R_1$, $V_2 = I R_2$, and $V_3 = I R_3$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying KVL to the single loop in the circuit:</p>
<p>Sum of voltage rises = Sum of voltage drops</p>
<p>$V_S = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$</p>
<p>Or, writing it as the algebraic sum around the loop equals zero (starting from the negative terminal of the source and going clockwise):</p>
<p>$+V_S - V_1 - V_2 - V_3 = 0$</p>
<p>This demonstrates that the voltage supplied by the source is equal to the total voltage dropped across the resistors in the closed loop, thus satisfying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.</p>

<p>Extrinsic semiconductors are intrinsic (pure) semiconductors that have been intentionally doped with impurity atoms to modify their electrical properties (conductivity). There are two types: n-type (doped with pentavalent impurities, creating excess free electrons) and p-type (doped with trivalent impurities, creating excess holes).</p>
<p>Two possible applications for extrinsic semiconductor materials:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Diodes:</strong> A fundamental component created by joining p-type and n-type extrinsic semiconductors (a p-n junction). Diodes allow current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) while blocking it in the opposite direction (reverse bias). They are used extensively in rectification (converting AC to DC), signal demodulation, voltage regulation (Zener diodes), and light emission (LEDs).</li>
    <li><strong>Transistors (BJTs and FETs):</strong> Transistors are the building blocks of modern electronics, used for amplification and switching. Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) use a sandwich structure of n-p-n or p-n-p extrinsic materials. Field-Effect Transistors (FETs), including MOSFETs, use an electric field to control the conductivity of a channel made of extrinsic semiconductor material. They are essential in integrated circuits (ICs), microprocessors, memory chips, and power electronics.</li>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Answers are AI-generated and may contain errors. Verify independently.</em></p>
<p><strong>(a) (i) Limitations of Holographic Storage:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cost and Complexity:</strong> The technology required for holographic storage (lasers, spatial light modulators, high-resolution detectors, precise alignment mechanisms) is currently expensive and complex compared to conventional storage methods like magnetic hard drives or flash memory. Mass production is challenging.</li>
    <li><strong>Material Stability and Sensitivity:</strong> The photosensitive materials used to record holograms can be sensitive to environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light exposure over time, potentially leading to data degradation or loss. Developing stable, long-lasting, and easily rewritable materials remains a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(a) (ii) Volatile vs. Non-Volatile Memory:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Volatile Memory:</strong> Requires continuous power to maintain the stored information. If the power supply is interrupted, the data is lost. Examples include RAM (Random Access Memory) like DRAM and SRAM, which are used for temporary storage of actively running programs and data due to their high speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Volatile Memory:</strong> Retains the stored information even when the power is turned off. It is used for long-term storage of data and programs. Examples include ROM (Read-Only Memory), flash memory (used in SSDs, USB drives), hard disk drives (HDDs), and optical discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) (i) Excess-3 equivalent of BCD 1001 0110 1000 0000:</strong></p>
<p>Convert each 4-bit BCD nibble to decimal, add 3, then convert back to 4-bit binary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$1001_2 = 9_{10}$. $9 + 3 = 12$. $12_{10} = 1100_2$.</li>
    <li>$0110_2 = 6_{10}$. $6 + 3 = 9$. $9_{10} = 1001_2$.</li>
    <li>$1000_2 = 8_{10}$. $8 + 3 = 11$. $11_{10} = 1011_2$.</li>
    <li>$0000_2 = 0_{10}$. $0 + 3 = 3$. $3_{10} = 0011_2$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: $1100 \, 1001 \, 1011 \, 0011_{\text{Excess-3}}$</p>
<p><strong>(b) (ii) Resistor Colour Codes:</strong></p>
<p>The values given ($75,000,000,005$ and $34,000,020$) seem unusually precise and large for standard resistor colour codes (typically 4 or 5 bands). Standard codes don't represent values with this many significant figures or such high magnitudes directly. Assuming these might be typos or require interpretation within a specific (non-standard) context or possibly relate to tolerance ranges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>(I) 75,000,000,000 ohms (75 GΩ) approx:</strong> A standard 5-band code might represent 750 GΩ (Violet-Green-Black, Multiplier: White (x1G), Tolerance). Representing exactly 75 GΩ or the given range with standard codes is problematic. If it were 7.5 GΩ, it might be Violet-Green-Gray (x100M). The extreme precision suggests this might not be a standard colour code question or there's a misunderstanding of the value intended.</li>
    <li><strong>(II) 34,000,000 ohms (34 MΩ) approx:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4-Band Code: Orange (3) - Yellow (4) - Blue (x1M multiplier) - Tolerance (e.g., Gold ±5%, Silver ±10%).</li>
            <li>5-Band Code: Orange (3) - Yellow (4) - Black (0) - Green (x100k multiplier) - Tolerance. (This gives 3.4 MΩ, not 34 MΩ). Or Orange (3) - Yellow (4) - Black (0) - Blue (x1M multiplier) - Tolerance (This gives 340 MΩ).</li>
        </ul>
        Again, the exact value 34 MΩ fits the 4-band code structure (Orange-Yellow-Blue). The range given (34,000,020 to 34,999,980) is extremely tight and doesn't correspond to standard tolerance bands (like ±1%, ±2%, ±5%, ±10%). This might imply a precision resistor or a non-standard coding. Assuming the closest standard representation for 34 MΩ: <strong>Orange - Yellow - Blue - [Tolerance Band]</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The resistor values provided are highly unusual for standard colour coding conventions, especially the precision and magnitude in (I) and the tight range in (II). The interpretation assumes the closest standard values or points out the discrepancy.</em></p>

<p><strong>(a) (i) Relationship between Voltage and Current in a Resistor (AC Circuit):</strong></p>
<p>In a purely resistive AC circuit, the voltage across the resistor ($V_R$) and the current flowing through it ($I_R$) are <strong>in phase</strong>. This means that both waveforms reach their maximum peaks, minimum troughs, and zero crossings at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Sketch:</p>
<pre class="diagram-code">
      ^ V, I
      |    / \       / \
      |   /   \     /   \     V (Voltage)

      |    \ /       \ /
</pre>
<p class="diagram-caption">Voltage (V) and Current (I) waveforms are in phase in a purely resistive AC circuit.</p>
<p>Mathematically, if the voltage is $V_R(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t)$, then the current is $I_R(t) = \frac{V_m}{R} \sin(\omega t) = I_m \sin(\omega t)$. The phase angle difference is zero.</p>

<p><strong>(a) (ii) Circuit Calculations:</strong></p>
<p>Given: Resistance $R = 60 \Omega$, Conductance $G = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Siemens.</p>
<p>Relationship: Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, $G = 1/R$.</p>
<p>Check: $1/R = 1/60 \approx 0.01667$ Siemens. This does not match the given $G = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Siemens. There seems to be an inconsistency in the provided values. Conductance and resistance should be reciprocals for a simple resistive element. Assuming the question intended these values for *different* parts of a circuit or there's a typo.</p>
<p>However, if we must proceed using the given $G$ and assume it relates to the same component (which is contradictory), we cannot directly determine V and I without more information (like power, or if V or I is applied). Ohm's Law ($V=IR$) requires knowing at least two of V, I, R. Conductance relates them as $I = VG$.</p>
<p>Let's assume the question intended to provide *either* R or G, and perhaps a voltage or current. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a voltage $V$ was applied: $I = V/R = V/60$ Amps. Or $I = VG = V \times (1.5 \times 10^{-3})$ Amps. (These give different currents due to the inconsistency).</li>
    <li>If a current $I$ was flowing: $V = IR = I \times 60$ Volts. Or $V = I/G = I / (1.5 \times 10^{-3})$ Volts. (These give different voltages).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion for (a)(ii):</strong> Cannot determine Voltage (V) and Current (I) uniquely without additional information or clarification on the inconsistent R and G values.</p>

<p><strong>(b) Decimal Operations to Binary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) $74 + 89$:</strong></p>

    <li>Sum in decimal: $74 + 89 = 163_{10}$</li>

<p><strong>(a) (i) Patterns of Current Flow in a Zener Diode:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Forward Bias Current:</strong> When forward biased (anode positive with respect to cathode), a Zener diode behaves like a normal silicon diode. A small forward voltage (typically around 0.7V) allows significant forward current to flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Bias (Zener Breakdown) Current:</strong> When reverse biased (cathode positive with respect to anode), a small leakage current flows until the reverse voltage reaches the Zener voltage ($V_Z$). At this point, Zener breakdown occurs, and a large reverse current can flow through the diode while the voltage across it remains relatively constant at $V_Z$. This is the operating region used for voltage regulation. (Note: If the reverse voltage significantly exceeds $V_Z$ without current limiting, avalanche breakdown can occur, potentially destroying the diode).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(a) (ii) Doped vs. Undoped Semiconductor:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undoped Semiconductor (Intrinsic Semiconductor):</strong> A pure semiconductor material (like Silicon or Germanium) with no added impurities. Its conductivity is relatively low and depends on temperature creating electron-hole pairs. The number of free electrons is equal to the number of holes.</li>
    <li><strong>Doped Semiconductor (Extrinsic Semiconductor):</strong> An intrinsic semiconductor to which small, controlled amounts of specific impurity atoms have been added (doping). This process significantly increases conductivity by creating an excess of either free electrons (n-type, doped with pentavalent atoms like Phosphorus) or holes (p-type, doped with trivalent atoms like Boron).</li>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Answers are AI-generated and may contain errors. Verify independently.</em></p>
<p><strong>(a) (i) Techniques for Reducing Radiation Loss in AC Circuits:</strong></p>
<p>Radiation loss occurs when electromagnetic energy escapes from an AC circuit, particularly at high frequencies. Techniques to reduce it include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> Enclosing components or the entire circuit within a conductive material (Faraday cage). The shield absorbs or reflects the electromagnetic radiation, preventing it from escaping.</li>
    <li><strong>Using Twisted Pair Wiring:</strong> Twisting the wires carrying the signal and its return path together. This causes the electromagnetic fields generated by the opposing currents in the wires to largely cancel each other out, reducing net radiation.</li>
    <li><strong>Proper Grounding and Layout:</strong> Designing the circuit layout to minimize loop areas (which act as antennas) and ensuring a solid, low-impedance ground plane can help contain fields and reduce radiation. Keeping high-frequency traces short is also important.</li>
    <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Using low-pass filters on power and signal lines where high-frequency components are not needed can suppress unwanted high-frequency signals that are more prone to radiating.</li>
</ol>
*(Note: The question asked for three techniques.)*

<p><strong>(a) (ii) Boolean Algebra Reduction Techniques (including De Morgan's):</strong></p>
<p>A term paper on De Morgan's theorem and Boolean reduction would likely include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Basic Identities/Laws:</strong> Applying fundamental rules like the Identity Law ($A+0=A, A \cdot 1=A$), Null Law ($A+1=1, A \cdot 0=0$), Idempotent Law ($A+A=A, A \cdot A=A$), Complement Law ($A+\bar{A}=1, A \cdot \bar{A}=0$), Commutative Law, Associative Law, Distributive Law.</li>
    <li><strong>De Morgan's Theorems:</strong> Applying the core theorems:
        <ul>
            <li>$\overline{A + B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}$</li>
            <li>$\overline{A \cdot B} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$</li>
        </ul>
        These are crucial for converting between AND/OR forms and NAND/NOR logic, and simplifying negated expressions.</li>
    <li><strong>Absorption Law:</strong> Using $A + (A \cdot B) = A$ and $A \cdot (A + B) = A$ to eliminate redundant terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Consensus Theorem:</strong> Applying $(A \cdot B) + (\overline{A} \cdot C) + (B \cdot C) = (A \cdot B) + (\overline{A} \cdot C)$ (and its dual) to remove consensus terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps):</strong> A graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions, particularly effective for up to 4-6 variables. It visually groups adjacent minterms (or maxterms) to find the simplest Sum-of-Products or Product-of-Sums form.</li>
    <li><strong>Quine-McCluskey Algorithm:</strong> A tabular method for Boolean simplification that is more systematic than K-maps and can be automated for a larger number of variables. It finds all prime implicants and then selects a minimal set to cover the function.</li>
</ol>
*(Note: Provided six common techniques, the question asked for five.)*

<p><strong>(b) (i) Reasons for DVD Popularity for Storing Movies:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>High Storage Capacity (compared to CD):</strong> DVDs offered significantly more storage capacity (typically 4.7 GB single-layer, 8.5 GB dual-layer) than CDs (around 700 MB). This capacity was sufficient to store a full-length feature film with good quality video (MPEG-2 compression) and multiple audio tracks/subtitles.</li>
    <li><strong>Good Video/Audio Quality and Durability:</strong> DVDs provided a substantial improvement in video and audio quality over VHS tapes. Being an optical medium, they were also more durable than magnetic tapes, less prone to wear from playback, and offered random access to scenes/chapters.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardization and Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> The DVD format became widely standardized and adopted by film studios and consumer electronics manufacturers. Mass production led to relatively low costs for both players and discs, making it an accessible and affordable medium for home video distribution.</li>
</ol>
*(Note: Provided three reasons, the question asked for two.)*

<p><strong>(b) (ii) Applications of a Potentiometer:</strong></p>
<p>A potentiometer is a variable resistor with three terminals, typically used as a voltage divider or a variable resistance.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Volume Control:</strong> Used in audio equipment (radios, amplifiers) to adjust the signal level sent to the amplifier or speakers, thereby controlling the volume.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimmer Switches:</strong> Used in lighting controls to vary the voltage or current supplied to a lamp, allowing adjustment of brightness.</li>
    <li><strong>Position Sensing/Transducers:</strong> The position of the wiper can correspond to a physical position (linear or rotational). This is used in joysticks, control surfaces in robotics, or throttle position sensors.</li>
    <li><strong>Calibration and Tuning:</strong> Used within circuits (often as trimmer potentiometers or "trimpots") to fine-tune circuit parameters like bias voltage, gain, or frequency during manufacturing or calibration.</li>
    <li><strong>Variable Voltage Divider:</strong> Used to provide an adjustable output voltage (between 0V and the input voltage) based on the wiper position, useful in power supplies or reference voltage generation.</li>
