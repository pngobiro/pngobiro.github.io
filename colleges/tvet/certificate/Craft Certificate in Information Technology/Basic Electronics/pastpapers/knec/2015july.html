                            <h4>Answer</h4>
                            <div class="answer-content">
                                <p><em>Disclaimer: Answers are AI-generated and may contain errors. Verify independently.</em></p>
                                <p>When an AC voltage $V(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t)$ is applied across a pure inductor (resistance R=0), the inductor opposes the change in current flow by inducing a back EMF. According to Faraday's law and Lenz's law, the voltage across the inductor is given by $V_L = L \frac{di}{dt}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, $L \frac{di}{dt} = V_m \sin(\omega t)$.</p>
                                <p>To find the current $i(t)$, we integrate: $di = \frac{V_m}{L} \sin(\omega t) dt$.</p>
                                <p>$i(t) = \int \frac{V_m}{L} \sin(\omega t) dt = \frac{V_m}{L} (-\frac{\cos(\omega t)}{\omega}) = -\frac{V_m}{\omega L} \cos(\omega t)$.</p>
                                <p>Since $-\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta - 90^\circ)$, we can write:</p>
                                <p>$i(t) = \frac{V_m}{\omega L} \sin(\omega t - 90^\circ)$.</p>
                                <p>The term $\omega L$ is the inductive reactance ($X_L$). So, $i(t) = \frac{V_m}{X_L} \sin(\omega t - 90^\circ) = I_m \sin(\omega t - 90^\circ)$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This shows that the current ($i$) through a pure inductor lags the voltage ($V$) across it by 90 degrees (or $\pi/2$ radians). When the voltage is at its peak, the rate of change of current is maximum, but the current itself is zero. When the voltage is zero, the rate of change of current is zero, and the current is at its peak (positive or negative).</p>

                                <p>In standard 8421 BCD, only 10 out of the 16 possible 4-bit patterns (0000 to 1001) are used to represent decimal digits 0-9. The remaining six patterns (1010 to 1111) are invalid BCD codes. Special bit patterns can refer to these invalid codes or specific valid codes used for signalling purposes.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Error Detection/Signalling:</strong> The six invalid BCD patterns (1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111) can be used to signal errors during transmission or processing. If one of these patterns is detected where a valid BCD digit is expected, it indicates a fault. Some systems might also use specific valid patterns (like 1001 for 9) or invalid patterns for special signals like end-of-record or sign indication (+/-), although this is less common in pure BCD.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Representing Signed Numbers:</strong> While not standard BCD itself, special patterns outside the 0-9 range (often using the invalid codes like 1100 for '+' and 1101 for '-') can be assigned in specific BCD implementations (like Packed BCD) to represent the sign of a number, typically in the least significant nibble.</li>

                                    <li><strong>8421 Code (Natural BCD):</strong> This is the most common method. Each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by its 4-bit weighted binary equivalent. The weights of the bits are 8, 4, 2, and 1, corresponding to the powers of 2 ($2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0$). For example, the decimal digit 7 is encoded as 0111 ($0 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 = 7$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Excess-3 Code:</strong> This is an unweighted BCD code where each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent plus 3 (binary 0011). For example, the decimal digit 7 is encoded as $7+3=10$, which is $1010$ in binary. An advantage is that the 9's complement of an Excess-3 digit can be found by simply inverting its bits, which simplifies subtraction logic in some older systems.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Signal Demodulation (AM Radio):</strong> Diodes can be used as envelope detectors to extract the original audio signal from an amplitude-modulated (AM) radio wave.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Circuit Protection:</strong> Diodes can protect circuits from reverse voltage (reverse polarity protection) or voltage spikes (flyback diodes in inductive circuits, transient voltage suppression diodes).</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Disadvantages of DRAM (Dynamic RAM):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Requires Refreshing:</strong> DRAM stores data in capacitors which leak charge over time. Therefore, it needs to be constantly refreshed (read and rewritten) every few milliseconds to retain data, consuming extra power and time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Slower Access Times:</strong> Compared to SRAM (Static RAM), DRAM generally has slower read and write access times due to the need for refreshing and the more complex addressing circuitry.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> Stores data magnetically on rotating platters coated with magnetic material. Uses read/write heads that move across the platters. Offers high capacity and relatively low cost per gigabyte. It's a mechanical device, making it susceptible to physical shock and slower than solid-state storage. Typically used as primary internal storage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Optical Disc (e.g., CD, DVD, Blu-ray):</strong> Stores data as pits and lands on a plastic disc, read by a laser. Data is accessed optically. Generally offers lower capacity than HDDs (though Blu-ray capacity is significant). Can be read-only (CD-ROM), recordable (CD-R), or rewritable (CD-RW). More portable and less susceptible to magnetic fields, but prone to scratches. Often used for software distribution, media playback, and backups/archiving.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Coping with challenges of emerging trends in electronics:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Continuous Learning & Education:</strong> Engineers and technicians need to constantly update their skills and knowledge through training, workshops, and self-study to keep up with new technologies, materials, and design methodologies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Investment in R&D and Advanced Tools:</strong> Companies need to invest in research and development to innovate and stay competitive. This includes acquiring advanced simulation software, testing equipment, and manufacturing capabilities required for complex, miniaturized components.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Standardization and Collaboration:</strong> Developing industry standards for new technologies helps ensure interoperability and reduces design complexity. Collaboration between companies, research institutions, and standards bodies accelerates progress.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Silicon vs Germanium Semiconductors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Band Gap Energy:</strong> Silicon has a larger band gap energy (~1.1 eV) compared to Germanium (~0.7 eV). This means Silicon requires more energy to excite electrons into the conduction band.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Temperature Stability:</strong> Silicon is more stable at higher temperatures. Germanium's higher leakage current increases significantly with temperature, limiting its operating range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Operating Voltage:</strong> Silicon diodes and transistors typically have a higher forward voltage drop (~0.7V) compared to Germanium (~0.3V).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> Silicon is far more abundant, cheaper to process, and forms a stable oxide (Silicon Dioxide, SiO2) which is an excellent insulator crucial for manufacturing integrated circuits. Germanium is less common and more expensive.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (i) PNP Transistor Structure and Current Flow:</strong></p>
                                <p>A PNP transistor consists of a thin layer of N-type semiconductor (the Base) sandwiched between two layers of P-type semiconductor (the Emitter and Collector).</p>

        | P |
         \ /
          |
      Collector (C)
      (Arrow indicates conventional current flow direction into Emitter)

   Current Flow (Active Region):
   - Small Base Current (Ib) flows OUT of the Base terminal.
   - Large Collector Current (Ic) flows from Emitter to Collector.
   - Emitter Current (Ie) flows into the Emitter terminal.
   - Ie = Ib + Ic
   - Conventional current flows into E, and out of C and B.
   - Hole flow is the dominant current: Holes flow from Emitter to Collector and from Emitter to Base.

                                    <li><strong>Negative Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:</strong> Unlike metals, the resistance of an intrinsic semiconductor decreases as temperature increases, because more thermal energy creates more free electron-hole pairs, increasing conductivity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Equal Electron and Hole Concentration:</strong> In a pure semiconductor, the number of free electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band, as they are generated in pairs through thermal excitation.</li>

                                    <li><strong>PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory):</strong> Can be programmed once by the user using a special PROM programmer device. Uses fuses or anti-fuses that are permanently altered during programming.</li>
                                    <li><strong>EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory):</strong> Can be erased by exposing its quartz window to strong ultraviolet (UV) light and then reprogrammed. Useful during development or for applications requiring occasional updates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory):</strong> Can be erased and reprogrammed electrically, byte by byte, without removing it from the circuit. Slower than RAM but non-volatile. Used for storing configuration data or small amounts of firmware.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flash Memory:</strong> A type of EEPROM that allows erasing and reprogramming in blocks rather than byte by byte, making it faster for larger data updates. Widely used in USB drives, SSDs, and memory cards.</li>
