                                <p>Voltage regulators are circuits designed to automatically maintain a constant output voltage level despite variations in the input voltage or changes in the load current.</p>
                                <p>Two common types are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Linear Voltage Regulators:</strong> These regulators operate by using an active pass element (like a BJT or MOSFET) controlled by a high-gain differential amplifier. The pass element acts like a variable resistor, continuously adjusting its resistance to dissipate excess input voltage as heat, thereby maintaining a constant output voltage.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em>Advantages:</em> Simple design, low output noise and ripple, fast transient response.</li>
                                            <li><em>Disadvantages:</em> Low efficiency (especially with large input-output voltage differences due to power dissipation as heat), requires heatsinking for significant power levels. Examples include the 78xx (positive) and 79xx (negative) series ICs.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Switching Voltage Regulators (Switch-Mode Power Supplies - SMPS):</strong> These regulators maintain the output voltage by rapidly switching a pass element (usually a MOSFET) ON and OFF. The resulting pulsed voltage is then filtered (typically using inductors and capacitors) to produce a smooth DC output. The duty cycle (ON-time vs. OFF-time) of the switch is adjusted by a control circuit (often using pulse-width modulation - PWM) to keep the output voltage constant under varying input or load conditions.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em>Advantages:</em> High efficiency (often 80-95%) as the switching element dissipates little power when fully ON or fully OFF, can step voltage up (boost), down (buck), or invert polarity.</li>
                                            <li><em>Disadvantages:</em> More complex design, can generate higher frequency noise (EMI) due to switching action, slower transient response compared to linear regulators.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>Given values:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>$R_1 = 5 \, \Omega$</li>
                                    <li>$R_2 = 8 \, \Omega$</li>
                                    <li>$R_3 = 7 \, \Omega$</li>
                                    <li>Voltage ($V$) = 40 V (Assuming this is the RMS voltage of the AC source)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the total resistance ($R_T$) is the sum of the individual resistances:</p>
                                $$ R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 $$
                                $$ R_T = 5 \, \Omega + 8 \, \Omega + 7 \, \Omega = 20 \, \Omega $$
                                <p>For a purely resistive AC circuit, Ohm's Law applies similarly to DC circuits, using RMS values for voltage and current. The total impedance (Z) is equal to the total resistance ($R_T$) because there is no reactance.</p>
                                $$ Z = R_T = 20 \, \Omega $$
                                <p>The current (I) in the circuit (assuming RMS value) is the voltage divided by the total impedance:</p>
                                $$ I = \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{V}{R_T} $$
                                $$ I = \frac{40 \, \text{V}}{20 \, \Omega} = 2 \, \text{A} $$
                                <p>Therefore, the current in the circuit is <strong>2 A</strong> (RMS).</p>

                                <p>Extrinsic semiconductors are pure semiconductors (like Silicon or Germanium) that have been intentionally doped with impurity atoms to significantly increase their conductivity and control the type of charge carrier (electrons or holes).</p>
                                <p>Two primary uses based on their types (n-type and p-type) are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Diodes:</strong> A fundamental use is creating a P-N junction by joining a piece of p-type semiconductor (with excess holes) and a piece of n-type semiconductor (with excess electrons). This junction allows current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) but blocks it in the reverse direction (reverse bias). This rectifying property is the basis for diodes used in power supplies (converting AC to DC), signal detection, voltage regulation, and many other electronic circuits.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Transistors:</strong> Extrinsic semiconductors are essential building blocks for transistors (both Bipolar Junction Transistors - BJTs and Field-Effect Transistors - FETs).
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>BJTs:</strong> Formed by sandwiching one type between two layers of the other (NPN or PNP). They use small changes in base current (or voltage) to control a much larger current flow between the collector and emitter, enabling amplification and switching applications.</li>
                                            <li><strong>FETs (e.g., MOSFETs):</strong> Use an electric field to control the conductivity of a channel made of extrinsic semiconductor material between a source and a drain terminal. They are crucial in digital logic circuits (like microprocessors and memory) and also used for amplification and switching.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Transistors are the fundamental components of virtually all modern electronic devices, enabling amplification, switching, and the creation of complex integrated circuits.

                                        <strong>Lower Speed and Performance:</strong> Compared to internal storage (like internal SSDs or HDDs connected via SATA or NVMe), removable media often have significantly slower data transfer rates (read/write speeds). This is due to interface limitations (e.g., USB speeds vs. internal bus speeds) and often the inherent speed of the media itself (especially for older types like CDs/DVDs or slower USB drives). This can lead to longer loading times and slower file operations.

                                        <strong>Durability and Reliability Concerns / Security Risks:</strong> Removable media are more susceptible to physical damage due to handling, dropping, or environmental factors (dust, moisture, temperature extremes). They can also wear out over time (e.g., flash memory has limited write cycles). Furthermore, their portability makes them easier to lose or steal, posing a significant security risk if they contain sensitive data. They are also a common vector for malware transmission between computers.

                                <p>The question specifies using *two* NOT gates. This is redundant for creating a NOR gate but can be shown in the diagram if required by the question's phrasing (though functionally only one NOT gate is needed after the OR).</p>

                                <p>Overflow occurs during arithmetic operations on signed binary numbers (typically using two's complement representation) when the result of the operation is too large (positive or negative) to be represented within the available number of bits.</p>
                                <p>Two circumstances where overflow can happen are:</p>

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Addition of Two Large Positive Numbers:</strong> When adding two positive numbers, if the result exceeds the maximum positive value representable by the given number of bits, overflow occurs. In two's complement, this is detected when the sign bit (Most Significant Bit - MSB) of both operands is 0 (positive), but the sign bit of the result is 1 (negative).
                                        <br><em>Example (4-bit):</em> $0101 (+5) + 0100 (+4) = 1001 (-7)$. The expected result (+9) cannot be represented in 4-bit two's complement (range is -8 to +7). The sign bits of operands are 0, but the result's sign bit is 1.

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Addition of Two Large Negative Numbers:</strong> When adding two negative numbers, if the result is more negative than the minimum negative value representable by the given number of bits, overflow occurs. In two's complement, this is detected when the sign bit (MSB) of both operands is 1 (negative), but the sign bit of the result is 0 (positive).
                                        <br><em>Example (4-bit):</em> $1011 (-5) + 1100 (-4) = (1)0111 (+7)$. The expected result (-9) cannot be represented. The sign bits of operands are 1, but the result's sign bit (ignoring the carry-out of the sign bit position) is 0.

                                <p><em>Note: Overflow cannot occur when adding one positive and one negative number, as the result's magnitude will always be less than or equal to the larger of the two operands' magnitudes.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Air Core Inductor:</strong> Consists of a coil of wire wound on a non-magnetic former (like plastic or ceramic) or simply self-supported. Used mainly in high-frequency applications (e.g., radio circuits) where low inductance values are needed and core losses must be minimized.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Iron Core Inductor:</strong> Uses a core made of ferromagnetic material (like laminated soft iron). The high permeability of the iron core significantly increases the inductance for a given number of turns. Used in low-frequency applications like power supply filters and audio circuits, but suffers from core losses at higher frequencies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ferrite Core Inductor:</strong> Uses a core made of ferrite, a ceramic material containing iron oxides. Ferrites offer high permeability like iron but have much higher electrical resistivity, reducing eddy current losses at higher frequencies. Used widely in high-frequency applications like switch-mode power supplies, RF circuits, and noise filters.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Wave Cycle Sketches:</strong></p>
                                <p><em>(Sketches described below, typically plotted with time on x-axis and amplitude on y-axis)</em></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>I. Sine Wave:</strong> A smooth, continuous, periodic wave that oscillates between a positive peak and a negative peak. One cycle starts at zero, rises to a positive maximum, falls back through zero to a negative minimum, and returns to zero. Shape follows the trigonometric sine function.</li>
                                    <li><strong>II. Square Wave:</strong> A periodic wave that abruptly alternates between two fixed voltage levels (e.g., high and low). One cycle consists of a period at the high level followed by an equal period at the low level, with near-instantaneous transitions between levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>III. Triangle Wave:</strong> A periodic wave characterized by linear ramps. One cycle starts at a minimum value, rises linearly to a maximum value, and then falls linearly back to the minimum value.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Conduction Band vs. Indirect Band Gap:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Conduction Band:</strong> In the energy band model of solids, the conduction band is the range of electron energy levels that are high enough for electrons to become mobile and contribute to electrical conduction. Electrons must gain sufficient energy (e.g., thermal or from light) to jump from the lower valence band across the band gap into the conduction band to conduct current.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Indirect Band Gap:</strong> This describes a property of some semiconductors (like Silicon and Germanium) where the minimum energy level in the conduction band and the maximum energy level in the valence band occur at different values of electron momentum (crystal momentum, k-vector). For an electron to transition across an indirect band gap (e.g., to recombine and emit light), it must change both its energy and its momentum, typically requiring interaction with lattice vibrations (phonons). This makes radiative recombination (light emission) much less efficient in indirect band gap semiconductors compared to direct band gap materials (like GaAs).</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Three Behaviours of Valence Electrons:</strong> (3 marks)</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Valence electrons are the outermost electrons and are directly involved in forming chemical bonds (covalent, ionic, metallic) with other atoms to create molecules and stable crystal structures.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Conduction:</strong> In conductors and semiconductors, valence electrons can gain sufficient energy (thermal, light, electric field) to break free from their atoms or bonds and move through the material, carrying electric current.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Determining Chemical Properties:</strong> The number and arrangement of valence electrons largely determine an element's chemical reactivity and how it interacts with other elements (e.g., its tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Quantities Required to Determine Resistivity:</strong> (4 marks)</p>
                                <p>Resistivity ($\rho$) is an intrinsic property of a material. To determine it experimentally for a conductor (usually in the form of a wire), the electrician would need to measure:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Resistance (R):</strong> The opposition the specific conductor sample offers to current flow. This can be measured using an Ohmmeter or by measuring voltage (V) across the conductor and current (I) through it and using Ohm's Law ($R = V/I$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Length (L):</strong> The length of the conductor sample through which the current flows. Measured using a ruler or measuring tape.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cross-Sectional Area (A):</strong> The area of the conductor perpendicular to the direction of current flow. For a wire, this is typically calculated from its diameter (d) or radius (r) using $A = \pi r^2 = \pi (d/2)^2$. The diameter can be measured using a micrometer screw gauge.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The resistivity is then calculated using the formula: $\rho = \frac{R \times A}{L}$. Therefore, the two fundamental quantities derived from measurements are Resistance (R) and the physical dimensions (Length L, and Area A).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Convert Binary to Gray Code:</strong></p>
                                <p>Rule: The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary number. For subsequent bits, the Gray code bit is the XOR (Exclusive OR) of the corresponding binary bit and the binary bit to its left.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Performance Bottleneck:</strong> External hard drives, especially those connected via USB 2.0 or even USB 3.0, typically have significantly slower data transfer speeds compared to internal drives (SATA/NVMe SSDs or HDDs). Running an entire operating system from such a drive leads to much slower boot times, application loading, and overall system responsiveness.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reliability and Convenience Issues:</strong> External drives are more prone to physical disconnection (accidental unplugging), which can cause system crashes or data corruption. They also require an extra device to be carried and connected, reducing portability and convenience compared to an internal OS installation. They are also more susceptible to physical damage.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>I. Joule (J):</strong> The SI unit of energy, work, or quantity of heat. It is equal to the work done when a force of one newton displaces a point through a distance of one meter in the direction of the force. In electrical terms, one joule is the energy transferred (or work done) when one ampere of current flows through a resistance of one ohm for one second, or when one coulomb of charge moves across a potential difference of one volt.</li>
                                    <li><strong>II. Power (P):</strong> The rate at which energy is transferred or work is done. Measured in Watts (W), where 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second (1 W = 1 J/s).</li>
                                    <li><strong>III. Charge Carrier:</strong> A mobile particle or quasiparticle whose movement carries electric charge through a material. In metals, the primary charge carriers are electrons. In semiconductors, charge carriers can be electrons (negative) or holes (positive quasiparticles representing the absence of an electron). In electrolytes, charge carriers are ions (positive and negative).</li>
                                    <li><strong>IV. Nucleus:</strong> The dense, positively charged central core of an atom, containing protons and neutrons (except for Hydrogen-1 which has only a proton). It contains nearly all the atom's mass.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Processing and Logic Operations:</strong> Microprocessors (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are complex ICs containing billions of transistors that perform calculations, execute instructions, and manage data flow, forming the "brain" of the computer. Logic gates, memory cells, and arithmetic units are all implemented within these ICs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Memory Storage:</strong> Both volatile memory (RAM - typically DRAM ICs) and non-volatile memory (like Flash memory ICs used in SSDs and USB drives, or ROM ICs for firmware) rely heavily on integrated circuits to store vast amounts of data compactly and allow for relatively fast access.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Two Challenges of Coping with Transforming Computer Memory Trends:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Compatibility and Interoperability:</strong> As new memory technologies (e.g., faster RAM types like DDR5, new SSD interfaces like PCIe 5.0, persistent memory) emerge, ensuring compatibility with existing hardware (motherboards, CPUs) and software (operating systems, drivers) becomes a challenge. Users and manufacturers need to manage transitions, potentially requiring hardware upgrades or facing periods where new memory benefits cannot be fully utilized due to bottlenecks elsewhere or lack of support.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cost and Manufacturing Complexity:</strong> Developing and manufacturing newer, denser, faster, or lower-power memory technologies often involves significant research and development investment and complex fabrication processes. This can initially lead to high costs for cutting-edge memory, making it inaccessible to some market segments. Scaling up production to meet demand while maintaining quality and reducing costs is an ongoing challenge for manufacturers.</li>
