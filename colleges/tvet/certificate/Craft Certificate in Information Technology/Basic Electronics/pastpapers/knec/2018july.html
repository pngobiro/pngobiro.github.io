                                <p>Acceptor elements are typically elements from Group 13 (or Group III) of the periodic table. When used to dope a Group 14 semiconductor (like Silicon or Germanium), they have one less valence electron than the semiconductor atom. This creates a "hole" (a missing electron in the covalent bond structure), which acts as a positive charge carrier, forming a p-type region.</p>

                                <p>A sketch would show a DC voltage source (e.g., a battery symbol) connected in a closed loop with three inductors represented by coil symbols, labelled $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$. These inductors are connected end-to-end, forming a series connection.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Current (I):</strong> An arrow labelled 'I' indicates the direction of conventional current flow around the loop, originating from the positive terminal of the voltage source, passing through $L_1$, then $L_2$, then $L_3$, and returning to the negative terminal. Since it's a series circuit, the current 'I' is the same through all components.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Voltages ($V_1, V_2, V_3$):</strong> Arrows or +/- signs across each inductor indicate the voltage drop across them. $V_1$ is across $L_1$, $V_2$ is across $L_2$, and $V_3$ is across $L_3$. The polarity would typically show the side where the current enters as positive and the side where it leaves as negative.</li>

                                <p>The operation is $345_8 + 43F_{16}$. To perform this, we first convert both numbers to decimal.</p>
                                <p><strong>1. Convert $345_8$ to Decimal:</strong></p>
                                $$ 345_8 = (3 \times 8^2) + (4 \times 8^1) + (5 \times 8^0) $$
                                $$ = (3 \times 64) + (4 \times 8) + (5 \times 1) $$
                                $$ = 192 + 32 + 5 = 229_{10} $$
                                <p><strong>2. Convert $43F_{16}$ to Decimal:</strong></p>
                                <p>Recall $F_{16} = 15_{10}$.</p>
                                $$ 43F_{16} = (4 \times 16^2) + (3 \times 16^1) + (15 \times 16^0) $$
                                $$ = (4 \times 256) + (3 \times 16) + (15 \times 1) $$
                                $$ = 1024 + 48 + 15 = 1087_{10} $$
                                <p><strong>3. Add the Decimal Equivalents:</strong></p>
                                $$ 229_{10} + 1087_{10} = 1316_{10} $$
                                <p>The question asks for the answer in decimal equivalent.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, $345_8 + 43F_{16} = \mathbf{1316_{10}}$.</p>

                                <p>Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry (flip-flops) to store each bit. Two key characteristics are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Speed:</strong> SRAM is significantly faster than Dynamic RAM (DRAM). Because it uses flip-flops, the data is readily available as long as power is supplied, and it doesn't require the periodic refreshing that DRAM needs. This high speed makes SRAM suitable for CPU caches (L1, L2, L3) where rapid access to frequently used data is critical for performance.

                                        <strong>Volatility (and No Refresh Needed):</strong> Like DRAM, SRAM is volatile, meaning it loses its stored data when the power supply is turned off. However, unlike DRAM which uses capacitors that leak charge and require constant refreshing cycles to maintain data, SRAM retains its data indefinitely as long as power is continuously supplied, without needing any refresh operations. This simplifies the control circuitry but contributes to higher power consumption compared to DRAM when idle.

                                <p>Read-Only Memory (ROM) is non-volatile memory, meaning it retains its data even when power is off. This makes it ideal for storing essential software that needs to be available immediately upon system startup.</p>

                                        <strong>Firmware Storage (e.g., BIOS/UEFI):</strong> ROM chips store the system's firmware, such as the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or its successor, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). This firmware contains the initial code required to start the computer, perform hardware initialization (like the Power-On Self-Test or POST), identify boot devices, and load the operating system from a storage drive (like an SSD or HDD). Because this code must be present before the main OS loads, non-volatile ROM is essential.

These embedded controllers often need their operating instructions permanently stored to manage the specific hardware functions they control, independent of the main operating system.

                                <p>Gray code, also known as reflected binary code, is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). This property is useful in preventing errors related to transitional states in digital systems.</p>
                                <p>Two application areas of Gray code in computers are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Electromechanical Switches and Position Encoders:</strong> Gray codes are widely used in rotary and linear position encoders. These devices translate physical position into a digital signal. If standard binary code were used, multiple bits could change simultaneously when moving between adjacent positions (e.g., from 0111 to 1000). Due to mechanical tolerances or timing issues, the sensor might read an intermediate, incorrect value during the transition. Gray code eliminates this problem because only one bit changes between consecutive positions, ensuring that any read value during a transition corresponds to one of the two adjacent valid positions, thus preventing spurious readings.

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Error Correction and Digital Communications:</strong> The single-bit change property of Gray codes can be advantageous in certain digital communication systems and error correction schemes. It can help minimize the impact of errors, as a single-bit error during transmission is more likely to result in a value that is numerically close to the original value compared to standard binary, where a single-bit error can sometimes lead to a large jump in numerical value. It's also used in ordering states within Karnaugh maps for simplifying Boolean logic circuits.

                                <p><strong>(a) Two Reasons for Using Hexadecimal Number System:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Conciseness and Readability:</strong> Hexadecimal provides a much shorter and more human-readable way to represent long binary numbers (which computers use internally). Each hexadecimal digit corresponds exactly to a 4-bit binary sequence (nibble), making conversion straightforward and representation compact. For example, the 16-bit binary number `1110 0101 1011 0010` is simply `E5B2` in hexadecimal, which is easier to write, read, and remember.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Direct Mapping to Binary:</strong> As mentioned, the direct 4-to-1 mapping between binary bits and hexadecimal digits simplifies debugging, memory addressing, and data representation in low-level programming and hardware design. It allows developers to easily visualize the underlying binary patterns represented by the hexadecimal code.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(i) Overcurrent:</strong> A situation in an electrical circuit where the current flowing through a conductor exceeds its rated capacity or the normal operating current of the circuit or equipment. Overcurrents can be caused by short circuits, ground faults, overloads, or design flaws. They can lead to overheating, damage to equipment, insulation breakdown, and fire hazards. Protective devices like fuses and circuit breakers are used to detect overcurrents and interrupt the circuit.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(ii) Wattage:</strong> Refers to the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or transferred in a circuit, measured in Watts (W). It represents the electrical power ($P$) and is calculated as the product of voltage ($V$) and current ($I$) in DC circuits ($P = V \times I$), or involves power factor in AC circuits. The wattage rating of a device indicates how much power it consumes during operation or how much power it can safely handle (e.g., a resistor's power rating).</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Four Examples of Read Only Memory (ROM):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Mask ROM (MROM):</strong> Programmed during manufacturing; cannot be changed afterward. Used for high-volume, stable firmware.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Programmable ROM (PROM):</strong> Can be programmed once by the user using special equipment (blowing fuses internally). Cannot be erased or reprogrammed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM):</strong> Can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet (UV) light through a quartz window on the chip, and then reprogrammed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM):</strong> Can be erased and reprogrammed electrically, byte by byte, without removing it from the circuit. Slower and less dense than Flash memory.</li>
                                    <li><em>(Flash Memory is often considered a type of EEPROM, offering block-level erasure/programming and higher density, commonly used in SSDs, USB drives, and modern firmware).</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Two Emerging Trends of Electronic Components:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Miniaturization and Integration (System-on-a-Chip - SoC):</strong> Continuously shrinking component sizes (following Moore's Law trends) allows for more functionality to be packed into smaller spaces. This leads to the integration of multiple system components (CPU, GPU, memory, controllers) onto a single chip (SoC), enabling powerful yet compact devices like smartphones, wearables, and IoT devices.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Low Power Consumption and Energy Harvesting:</strong> With the rise of mobile computing and IoT, there's a strong focus on developing ultra-low-power components. This extends battery life and enables devices to operate in energy-constrained environments. Coupled with this is the trend towards energy harvesting technologies, where components can scavenge power from ambient sources like light, vibration, or thermal gradients, potentially leading to self-powered devices.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) BCD Evaluation: $91 + 79$</strong></p>
                                <p>1. Convert to BCD:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>91: $9 \rightarrow 1001$; $1 \rightarrow 0001$. So, $1001 \, 0001_{\text{BCD}}$</li>
                                    <li>79: $7 \rightarrow 0111$; $9 \rightarrow 1001$. So, $0111 \, 1001_{\text{BCD}}$</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>2. Add the BCD numbers using binary addition:</p>
                                <pre class="code-block">
  (Carry) ->   1   1
               1001 0001

                                    <li>Right group: $1010$. This is $> 9$ (invalid BCD). Add 6 (0110): $1010 + 0110 = 1 \, 0000$. Write down $0000$, carry 1 to the next group.</li>
                                    <li>Left group: $10000$ (original sum) + carry 1 = $10001$. Split this: Left digit group is $1$, right digit group is $0001$. The group $0001$ is $\le 9$, so no adjustment needed here. The carry-out '1' forms a new BCD group.</li>
                                    <li>Final BCD groups (left to right): Carry '1' $\rightarrow 0001$; Left group result '0001'; Right group result '0000'.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Power (P):</strong> Power is the <strong>rate</strong> at which energy is transferred, used, or converted. It measures how quickly work is done or energy is consumed. In electrical circuits, it's typically measured in Watts (W). $P = \frac{Energy}{Time}$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Energy (E or W):</strong> Energy is the <strong>capacity</strong> to do work. It represents a total amount of work done or potential work that can be done over a period. In electrical terms, it's often measured in Joules (J) or kilowatt-hours (kWh). $Energy = Power \times Time$.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong> This is the predominant type of bond in common semiconductors like Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge). Atoms in these materials have four valence electrons. In the crystal lattice, each atom shares one valence electron with each of its four nearest neighbors, forming strong covalent bonds. These bonds hold the crystal together and keep the valence electrons relatively localized at low temperatures.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ionic Bonds (less common in elemental semiconductors, more relevant in compound semiconductors):</strong> While covalent bonding dominates in Si and Ge, compound semiconductors (like Gallium Arsenide - GaAs) can exhibit some degree of ionic character in their bonding. This involves the transfer of electrons between different types of atoms, creating positive and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attraction. However, for typical elemental semiconductors, covalent bonding is the primary mechanism. <em>(Note: Metallic bonds are generally not considered primary bonds within the semiconductor material itself, though they are relevant for contacts).</em></li>

                                    <li><strong>Electrical Conductivity ($\sigma$):</strong> This is an intrinsic property of a material that measures how easily electric current can flow through it. A high conductivity indicates that current flows easily. It is the reciprocal of resistivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$). The unit is Siemens per meter (S/m).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electrical Resistivity ($\rho$):</strong> This is also an intrinsic property of a material that measures how strongly the material opposes the flow of electric current. A high resistivity indicates that the material strongly resists current flow. It is the reciprocal of conductivity ($\rho = 1/\sigma$). The unit is Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot m$).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In essence, conductivity describes the ease of current flow, while resistivity describes the opposition to current flow. They are inversely related material properties.</p>

                                    <li>$R_2$ and $R_3$ are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance ($R_{23}$) is:
                                        $$ R_{23} = \frac{R_2 \times R_3}{R_2 + R_3} = \frac{60 \times 50}{60 + 50} = \frac{3000}{110} \approx 27.27 \, \Omega $$</li>
                                    <li>This parallel combination ($R_{23}$) is in series with $R_1$. Their combined resistance ($R_{123}$) is:

                                    <li>This entire branch ($R_{123}$) is in parallel with $R_4$. The total equivalent resistance ($R_T$) of the circuit is:
                                        $$ R_T = \frac{R_{123} \times R_4}{R_{123} + R_4} = \frac{37.27 \times 40}{37.27 + 40} = \frac{1490.8}{77.27} \approx 19.29 \, \Omega $$</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The total resistance is approximately $\mathbf{19.29 \, \Omega}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(II) Describe the flow of current in the resistors $R_5$ and $R_4$:</strong></p>

                                    <li><strong>Current through $R_4$:</strong> The total current ($I_T$) from the voltage source V splits at the junction before $R_1$ and $R_4$. A portion of the total current, let's call it $I_4$, flows directly through $R_4$. The voltage across $R_4$ is the source voltage V. So, $I_4 = V / R_4 = V / 40$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Current Flow Description (General):</strong> The total current $I_T$ leaves the positive terminal of V. It splits into $I_4$ (through $R_4$) and $I_{123}$ (through the other branch). $I_{123}$ flows through $R_1$, then splits again into $I_2$ (through $R_2$) and $I_3$ (through $R_3$). $I_2$ and $I_3$ recombine after $R_2$ and $R_3$, and this combined current ($I_{123}$) joins with $I_4$ to return to the negative terminal of V.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Three Circumstances for Two's Complement Use:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Representing Signed Integers:</strong> Two's complement is the standard method used by most modern computers to represent both positive and negative integers. The most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining bits represent the magnitude in a way that simplifies arithmetic.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Performing Subtraction using Addition:</strong> Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) in CPUs can perform subtraction by adding the two's complement of the subtrahend to the minuend. This allows the same adder circuitry to be used for both addition and subtraction, simplifying hardware design. (e.g., $X - Y$ becomes $X + (\text{2's complement of } Y)$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Arithmetic Operations in Digital Logic:</strong> The properties of two's complement representation (single representation for zero, easy negation, straightforward addition/subtraction) make it efficient for implementing arithmetic operations directly in digital hardware (ALUs, processors).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Distinguish between Electrode and Electrolyte:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Electrode:</strong> An electrode is a solid electrical conductor (usually a metal or graphite) through which electric current enters or leaves an electrical device, particularly an electrochemical cell (like a battery). In a battery, there are two electrodes: the anode (negative electrode, where oxidation occurs) and the cathode (positive electrode, where reduction occurs).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electrolyte:</strong> An electrolyte is a substance (usually a liquid or gel containing ions) that conducts electricity through the movement of ions. In a battery, the electrolyte is located between the two electrodes and allows ions to move between them, completing the electrical circuit internally and facilitating the chemical reactions that produce electricity. It prevents the electrons from flowing directly between electrodes internally, forcing them through the external circuit.</li>

                                <p>Impedance is the total opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of alternating current (AC) at a particular frequency. It is a complex quantity that includes both resistance (R), which dissipates energy, and reactance (X), which stores energy in electric or magnetic fields (due to capacitors and inductors). Impedance is measured in Ohms ($\Omega$) and is represented as $Z = R + jX$ (in rectangular form) or $|Z|\angle\theta$ (in polar form), where $|Z|$ is the magnitude and $\theta$ is the phase angle between voltage and current.</p>

                                <p>First, note the repeated $ABC$ terms. Using the Idempotent Law ($X+X = X$), we can simplify the expression to:</p>
                                $$ F = \bar{A}BC + A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} + ABC $$
                                <p>We can use Boolean algebra or a K-map. Using algebra:</p>
                                <p>Factor out common terms:</p>
                                $$ F = BC(\bar{A} + A) + A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} $$
                                <p>Since $\bar{A} + A = 1$:</p>
                                $$ F = BC(1) + A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} $$
                                $$ F = BC + A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} $$
                                <p>Factor out A:</p>
                                $$ F = BC + A(\bar{B}C + B\bar{C}) $$
                                <p>The term in the parenthesis is the XOR function ($B \oplus C$).</p>
                                $$ F = BC + A(B \oplus C) $$
                                <p>Alternatively, using consensus theorem or K-map simplification often leads to a simpler sum-of-products form. Let's try factoring differently:</p>

                                $$ F = C(\bar{A}B + A\bar{B} + AB) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                $$ F = C(\bar{A}B + A(\bar{B} + B)) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                $$ F = C(\bar{A}B + A(1)) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                $$ F = C(\bar{A}B + A) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                <p>Using $X + \bar{X}Y = X + Y$:</p>
                                $$ F = C(A + B) + AB\bar{C} $$
                                $$ F = AC + BC + AB\bar{C} $$
                                <p>Let's check the K-map (from Q13, we know $ABC$ is 111, $AB\bar{C}$ is 110, $A\bar{B}C$ is 101, $\bar{A}BC$ is 011):</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Three Disadvantages of Integrated Circuits (ICs):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Difficult/Impossible Repair:</strong> If a single component within an IC fails, the entire chip usually needs to be replaced. Repairing individual components on the silicon die is generally not feasible.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limited Power Handling:</strong> Due to their small size and high component density, standard ICs typically cannot handle very high power levels or high voltages compared to discrete components. High power dissipation can lead to overheating and failure.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inductors and Large Capacitors Difficult to Fabricate:</strong> While transistors, diodes, resistors, and small capacitors are easily integrated, fabricating high-value inductors or large capacitors directly onto an IC is difficult, inefficient, or costly. These often need to be implemented as external discrete components.</li>
                                    <li><em>(Other potential disadvantages: Susceptibility to static discharge, design inflexibility once manufactured, high initial design and fabrication costs for custom ICs).</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Parallel Circuit Diagram Description:</strong></p>
                                <p>A sketch would show two batteries (voltage sources, potentially shown in series or parallel depending on desired voltage/capacity) connected to three resistors ($R_1, R_2, R_3$). The key feature is the parallel connection of the resistors:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The "top" ends of all three resistors ($R_1, R_2, R_3$) are connected together to one common point (or wire).</li>
                                    <li>The "bottom" ends of all three resistors are connected together to another common point (or wire).</li>
                                    <li>These two common points are then connected across the terminals of the battery combination.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Current Flow:</strong> The total current ($I_T$) leaves the positive terminal of the battery source. It reaches the first common point and splits into three separate currents: $I_1$ through $R_1$, $I_2$ through $R_2$, and $I_3$ through $R_3$. These three currents then recombine at the second common point and the total current $I_T$ returns to the negative terminal of the battery source. The voltage across each parallel resistor is the same and equal to the source voltage.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Assuming a standard Bohr model representation:</p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li><strong>III: Electron</strong> (A negatively charged particle orbiting the nucleus).</li>
                                    <li><strong>IV: Valence Shell / Outermost Shell</strong> (The outermost energy level containing valence electrons involved in bonding).</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Explain Battery Terms:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Float Charging:</strong> A method of charging a secondary (rechargeable) battery where it is continuously connected to a charger that supplies a low, constant voltage just sufficient to counteract the battery's self-discharge rate and maintain it at a fully charged state. It's commonly used for backup power systems (like UPS batteries or emergency lighting) to ensure the battery is always ready without overcharging it significantly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Memory Effect:</strong> A phenomenon observed primarily in older Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) and, to a lesser extent, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries. If these batteries are repeatedly recharged before being fully discharged, they can appear to "remember" the point at which recharging began and subsequently only deliver the capacity used before recharging, effectively reducing their usable capacity. Modern Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries do not suffer from this memory effect.</li>
