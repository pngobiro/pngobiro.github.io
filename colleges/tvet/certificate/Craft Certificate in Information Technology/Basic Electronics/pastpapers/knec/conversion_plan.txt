## 4. Automated Verification Process

To verify HTML files:
1. Navigate to the examples directory: `cd examples`
2. Run: `python3 verify_pastpapers.py ../your-file.html`

The verification script checks:
- HTML Structure (semantic elements, nesting)
- Required Elements (headers, navigation, content sections)
- Navigation Links (working hrefs, proper text)
- CSS Styling (classes, layout)
- Images (loading, alt text)
- Sidebar (structure, links)

Example usage:
```bash
cd examples
python3 verify_pastpapers.py ../2015july.html
```
