                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Memory is the electronic holding place for instructions and data that your computer's microprocessor can reach quickly. When your computer is in normal operation, its memory usually contains the main parts of the operating system and some or all of the application programs and related data that are being used.</p>
                        <p>Memory is sometimes distinguished from storage, or the physical medium that holds the much larger amounts of data that won't fit into RAM and may not be immediately needed there.</p>

                        <h3>Characteristics of Computer Memory</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Electrical Characteristics</strong> - The voltage and current requirements depend on the manufacturing technology of the device. The voltage level is not of major concern because most of the semiconductor memory devices operate at TTL voltage levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speed</strong> - There is a finite time delay between the application of address and the availability of stable and accurate data on the data lines. This memory delay depends on the manufacturing technology and other factors such as size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Capacity</strong> representing the global volume of information (in bits) that the memory can store. Memory is small in size and hence its storage is relatively low</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Memories</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Memory is primarily of three types -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cache Memory</li>
                            <li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
                            <li>Secondary Memory</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Cache Memory</h3>
                        <p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU. The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <p>The advantages of cache memory are as follows -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
                            <li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
                            <li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
                            <li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
                            <li>It is very expensive.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h3>
                        <p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required to be processed resides in the main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.</p>

                        <h4>Characteristics of Main Memory</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are semiconductor memories.</li>
                            <li>It is known as the main memory.</li>
                            <li>Usually volatile memory.</li>
                            <li>Data is lost in case power is switched off.</li>
                            <li>It is the working memory of the computer.</li>
                            <li>Faster than secondary memories.</li>
                            <li>A computer cannot run without the primary memory.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
                        <p>This type of memory is also known as external memory or nonvolatile. It is slower than the main memory. These are used for storing data/information permanently. CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. The contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it. For example, disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Characteristics of Secondary Memory</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are magnetic and optical memories.</li>
                            <li>It is known as the backup memory.</li>
                            <li>It is a non-volatile memory.</li>
                            <li>Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.</li>
                            <li>It is used for storage of data in a computer.</li>
                            <li>Computer may run without the secondary memory.</li>
                            <li>Slower than primary memories.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Examples of Secondary Memory</h4>
                        <p><strong>Magnetic Disks:-</strong> Magnetic storage or magnetic recording is the storage of data on a magnetized medium. Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetization in a magnetisable material to store data and is a form of non-volatile memory. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads.</p>
                        <h5>Examples</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hard Disk Drive</li>
                            <li>Floppy Disk</li>
                            <li>Memory Stick</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Optical Disks:-</strong> Optical storage is the storage of data on an optically readable medium. Data is recorded by making marks in a pattern that can be read back with the aid of light, usually a beam of laser light precisely focused on a spinning optical disc.</p>
                        <h5>Examples</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>CD</li>
                            <li>DVD</li>
                            <li>Blue-ray Disk</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Solid state disk:</strong> SSD incorporates the storage technique implemented in microchip-based flash memory, where data is electronically stored on flash memory chips. An SSD is an entirely electronic storage device, and its physical assembly contains no mechanical objects.</p>
                        <h5>Examples</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pen Drive</li>
                            <li>Flash Drive</li>
                            <li>Thumb Drive</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Units of memory</h3>
