                        <p>Most students of electricity begin their study with what is known as direct current (DC), which is electricity flowing in a constant direction, and/or possessing a voltage with constant polarity. DC is the kind of electricity made by a battery (with definite positive and negative terminals), or the kind of charge generated by rubbing certain types of materials against each other.</p>
                        <p>As useful and as easy to understand as DC is, it is not the only "kind" of electricity in use. Certain sources of electricity (most notably, rotary electro-mechanical generators) naturally produce voltages alternating in polarity, reversing positive and negative over time. Either as a voltage switching polarity or as a current switching direction back and forth, this "kind" of electricity is known as Alternating Current (AC): Figure below</p>

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>In AC electrical theory every power source supplies a voltage that is either a sine wave of one particular frequency or can be considered as a sum of sine waves of differing frequencies. The neat thing about a sine wave such as <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{t})=\mathrm{A} \sin (\omega \mathrm{t}+\delta)\)</span> is that it can be considered to be directly related to a vector of length A revolving in a circle with angular velocity <span class="math-inline">\(\omega\)</span> - in fact just the <span class="math-inline">\(y\)</span> component of the vector. The phase constant <span class="math-inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the starting angle at <span class="math-inline">\(t=0\)</span>. In Figure 1, shows this</p>

                        <p>A 2D drawing of a rotating vector shows the vector inscribed in the centre of a circle as indicated in Figure 2 below. The angular frequency <span class="math-inline">\(\omega\)</span> may or may not be indicated.</p>

                        <p>When two sine waves are produced on the same display, one wave is often said to be leading or lagging the other. This terminology makes sense in the revolving vector picture as shown in Figure 3. The blue vector is said to be leading the red vector or conversely the red vector is</p>
                        <p><strong>lagging the blue vector.</strong></p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In a simple circuit that is used to light a bulb with a battery, the battery provides direct current-a current flowing in only one direction. This section is concerned with the analysis of simple direct current circuits of two types: (1) those with combinations of resistor elements and (2) those with batteries in different branches of a multiple-loop circuit.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Series and parallel resistors</h3>
                        <p>Resistance, at least to some degree, exists in all electrical elements. The resistors might be light bulbs, heating elements, or components specifically manufactured for their resistance. It is assumed that the resistance in the connecting wires is negligible.</p>
                        <p>The series connection of two resistors ( <span class="math-inline">\(R_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(R_{2}\)</span> ) is shown in Figure 1. What is the equivalent resistor for this combination?</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-11.jpg" alt="Two resistors connected in series">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Because there is only one pathway for the charges, the current is the same at any point in the circuit, that is, <span class="math-inline">\(I=I_{1}=I_{2}\)</span>. The potential difference supplied by the battery equals the potential drop over <span class="math-inline">\(R_{1}\)</span> and the potential drop over <span class="math-inline">\(R_{2}\)</span>. Thus,</p>
                        <div class="equation">\[V=V_{1}+V_{2}\]</div>
                        <p>from Ohm's law,</p>
                        <div class="equation">\[V=I R_{1}+I R_{2}\]</div>
                        <p>and</p>
                        <div class="equation">\[V=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)\]</div>
                        <p>therefore, <span class="math-inline">\(\quad R_{\text {eq }}=R_{1}+R_{2}\)</span></p>
                        <p>When resistors are in series, the equivalent resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.</p>
                        <p>Compare this result with adding capacitors in series. For series resistors, the current is the same; while for series capacitors, the charge is the same. (Note that the equivalent resistance is a simple sum, but the equivalent capacitance is given by a reciprocal expression.)</p>
                        <p>The parallel connection for two resistors ( <span class="math-inline">\(R_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(R_{2}\)</span> ) is shown in Figure 2. What is the equivalent resistance for this combination?</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-12.jpg" alt="Two resistors connected in parallel">

                        <p>At point <span class="math-inline">\(a\)</span> for the circuit diagram - see Figure (b)—the current branches so that part of the total current in the circuit goes through the upper branch and part through the lower branch. The potential drop of the current is the same regardless of which path is taken; therefore, the voltage difference is the same over either resistor ( <span class="math-inline">\(V_{\text {batti }}{ }^{G}={ }^{\circ} V_{1}=V_{2}\)</span> ). The currents sum to the total current: <span class="math-inline">\(I=I_{1}+I_{2}\)</span> from Ohm's law, <span class="math-inline">\(I=\frac{V}{R_{1}}+\frac{V}{R_{2}}\)</span>, and <span class="math-inline">\(I=V\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)\)</span> therefore, <span class="math-inline">\(\frac{1}{R_{r q}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}\)</span></p>
                        <p>Thus, the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors in the parallel combination. Compare this result with adding capacitors in parallel. For parallel resistors, the voltages across the resistors are equal, and the same is true for parallel capacitors. (Note that the equivalent resistance is a reciprocal expression, but the equivalent capacitance for parallel combination is a simple sum.)</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Kirchhoff's rules</h3>
                        <p>If a circuit has several batteries in the branches of multiloop circuits, the analysis is greatly simplified by using Kirchhoff's rules, which are forms of conservation laws:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sum of the currents entering a junction must equal the sum of the currents leaving the junction. This rule, sometimes called the junction rule, is a statement of conservation of charge. Because charge neither builds up at any place in the circuit nor leaves the circuit, the charge entering a point must also leave that point.</li>
                            <li>The algebraic sum of the drops in potential across each element around any loop must equal the algebraic sum of the emfs around any loop. This rule expresses conservation of energy. In other words, the charge moving around any loop must gain as much energy from batteries as it loses when going through resistors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When applying Kirchhoff's rules, use consistent sign conventions. Refer to the directions selected for the currents in Figure. Fewer mistakes will be made if one direction is consistently used-for example, clockwise in all loops. If an incorrect direction for one current is selected initially, the solution for that current will be negative. Use the following sign conventions when applying the loop rule:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the resistor is traveled in the direction of the current, the change in potential is negative, and if traveled opposite to the selected direction of the current, it is positive.</li>
                            <li>If a source of emf is traveled in the direction of the emf (from - to + between the terminals), then the change in potential is positive, and if traveled opposite to the direction of the emf, it is negative.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Check the equations for Figure 3.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <p>Imagine that the values of the resistances and voltage were given for this problem. Then, it would be possible to write four different equations: the junction equation, the top loop, the bottom loop, and the outside loop. Only three currents exist, however, so only three equations are necessary. In this case, solve the set of equations that are the easiest to manipulate.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Resistivity of conductors</h3>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Resitivity is a measure of the resistance to electrical conduction for a given size of material. Its opposite is electrial conductivity ( =1 / resistivity).</li>
                            <li>Metals are good electrical conductors (high conductivity and low resistivity), while nonmetals are mostly poor conductors (low conductivity and high resistivity).</li>
                            <li>The more familiar term electrical resistance measures how difficult it is for a piece of material to conduct electricity - this depends on the size of the piece: the resistance is higher for a longer or narrower section of material.</li>
                            <li>To remove the effect of size from resistance, resistivity is used - this is a material property which does not depend on size.</li>
                            <li>Restivity is affected by temperature - for most materials the resistivity increases with temperature. An exception is semiconductors (e.g. silicon) in which the resistivity decreases with temperature.</li>
                            <li>The ease with which a material conducts heat is measured by thermal conductivity. As a first estimate, good electrical conductors are also good thermal conductors.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Design issues</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Resistivity is important in any product which conducts electricity. Components which must conduct easily (called "conductors") must have low resistivity, while those which must not conduct (called "insulators") must have high resistivity.</li>
                            <li>Many products will contain both conductors and insulators, e.g. a 13A plug - the conductors take the electricity where it is wanted (the machine or appliance) and the insulators prevent it from getting where it isn't wanted (i.e. the user!)</li>
                            <li>The resistivity of insulators and conductors differ by a huge factor - typically one million, million, million! Within a given class of materials {e.g. metals), the resistivity can still vary by a factor of 1000 or more. The differences look small compared to the difference between metals and insulators like polymers, but can be very significant in choosing the metal for a conductor - 1000 times more current forthe same voltage.</li>
                            <li>Electrical and thermal conductivity are closely related. Examples of products in which good thermal conduction is required are radiators and saucepans; thermal insulation is required for pan handles and cookers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Measurement</h4>
                        <p>Observations of how the resistance varies with size of a sample suggest that resitivity obeys the relationship:</p>
                        <p><strong>Electrical resistivity = resistance * cross-sectional area / length</strong></p>
                        <div class="equation">\[R=\frac{\rho l}{A} \left\lvert\, \begin{aligned}
                         & \begin{array}{l}
                         \mathrm{R} \text { is the resistance of the conductor in Ohms } \\
                         \mathrm{A}_{\text {is the }} \text { is coss sectional area in } \mathrm{m}^{2}
                         \end{array} \\
                         & l_{\text {is the lengh of the wire in meters }} \\
                         & \text { is the esistivity of fhe material in } \mathrm{O} \text { Omm(neters) }
                         \end{aligned}\right.\]</div>
                        <p>The resistivity can therefore be calculated quite easily be measuring the resistance of a piece of wire of constant cross-section and known length.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>In practive resistivity is difficult to measure accurately because of the effect of temperature. More sophisticated techniques need to be used if accurate measurements are required, e.g. a Wheatstone bridge.</p>

                        <h4>Units & Values</h4>
                        <p>From the definition of resitivity it can be seen that it has units of ohm-metres. Giving exact values can be difficult because of the strong temperature dependence Data are usually given for room temperature.</p>
