                        <p>Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to meta-mathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Set theory</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A set can be defined as a collection of things that are brought together because they obey a certain rule.</p>
                        <p>These 'things' may be anything you like: numbers, people, shapes, cities, bits of text ..., literally anything.</p>
                        <p>The key fact about the 'rule' they all obey is that it must be well-defined. In other words, it enables us to say for sure whether or not a given 'thing' belongs to the collection. If the 'things' we're talking about are English words, for example, a well-defined rule might be:</p>
                        <p>'... has 5 or more letters'</p>
                        <p>A rule which is not well-defined (and therefore couldn't be used to define a set) might be:</p>
                        <p>'... is hard to spell'</p>

                        <h3>Requirement of a set</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A set must be well defined i.e. it must not leave any room for ambiguities e.g sets of all students- which? Where? When?</li>
                            <li>A set must be defined in terms of space and time</li>
                            <li>The objective (elements or members) from a given set must be distinct i.e each object must appear once and only once, Must appear but not more than once</li>
                            <li>The order of the presentation of elements of a given set is immaterial e.g <span class="math-inline">\(1,2,3=1,3,2=3,2,1\)</span></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Types of Sets</h3>
                        <p>In set theory, there are different types of sets. All the operations in set theory could be based on sets. Set should be a group of individual terms in domain. The universal set has each and every element of domain. We are having different types of sets. We will see about the different types of sets.</p>

                        <h4>Different Types of Sets</h4>
                        <p>There are different types of sets in set theory. They are listed below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Universal Set</li>
                            <li>Empty set</li>
                            <li>Singleton set</li>
                            <li>Finite and Infinite set</li>
                            <li>Union of sets</li>
                            <li>Intersection of sets</li>
                            <li>Difference of sets</li>
                            <li>Subset of a set</li>
                            <li>Disjoint sets</li>
                            <li>Equality of two sets</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Universal Set</h4>
                        <p>The set of all the 'things' currently under discussion is called the universal set (or sometimes, simply the universe). It is denoted by <strong>U</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The universal set doesn't contain everything in the whole universe. On the contrary, it restricts us to just those things that are relevant at a particular time. For example, if in a given situation we're talking about numeric values - quantities, sizes, times, weights, or whatever - the universal set will be a suitable set of numbers (see bełow). In another context, the universal set may be {alphabetic characters} or {all living people\}, etc.</p>

                        <h4>Singleton Set:</h4>
                        <p>A set which contains only one element is called a singleton set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(A=\{x: x\)</span> is neither prime nor composite}</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is a singleton set containing one element, i.e., 1.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(B=\{x: x\)</span> is a whole number, <span class="math-inline">\(x<1\}\)</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This set contains only one element 0 and is a singleton set.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let <span class="math-inline">\(A=\left\{x: x \in N\right.\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(\left.x^{2}=4\right\}\)</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here A is a singleton set because there is only one element 2 whose square is 4.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let <span class="math-inline">\(B=\{x: x\)</span> is a even prime number}</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here B is a singleton set because there is only one prime number which is even, i.e., 2.</p>

                        <h4>Finite Set:</h4>
                        <p>A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set. Empty set is also called a finite set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The set of all colors in the rainbow.</li>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(N=\{x: x \in N, x<7\}\)</span></li>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(P=\{2,3,5,7,11,13,17, \ldots . .\}\)</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Infinite Set:</h4>
                        <p>The set whose elements cannot be listed, i.e., set containing never-ending elements is called an infinite set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set of all points in a plane</li>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(A=\{x: x \in N, x>1\}\)</span></li>
                            <li>Set of all prime numbers</li>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(B=\{x: x \in W, x=2 n\}\)</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
                        <p>All infinite sets cannot be expressed in roster form.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p>The set of real numbers since the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern.</p>

                        <h4>Cardinal Number of a Set:</h4>
                        <p>The number of distinct elements in a given set A is called the cardinal number of A . It is denoted by <span class="math-inline">\(n(A)\)</span>.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="math-inline">\(A\{x: x \in N, x<5\} A=\{1,2,3,4\}\)</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">\(n(A)=4\)</span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>B = set of letters in the word ALGEBRA</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="equation">\[B=\{A, L, G, E, B, R\}\]</div>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">\(n(B)=6\)</span></p>

                        <h4>Equivalent Sets:</h4>
                        <p>Two sets <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> are said to be equivalent if their cardinal number is same, i.e., <span class="math-inline">\(n(A)=n(B)\)</span>.</p>
                        <p>The symbol for denoting an equivalent set is ' <span class="math-inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> '.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <div class="equation">\[A=\{1,2,3\} \text { Here } n(A)=3 B=\{p, q, r\} \text { Here } n(B)=3 \text { Therefore, } A \leftrightarrow B\]</div>

                        <h4>Equal sets:</h4>
                        <p>Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they contain the same elements. Every element of A is an element of <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> is an element of <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">\(A=\{p, q, r, s\} B=\{p, s, r, q\}\)</span></p>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">\(A=B\)</span></p>
                        <p>The various types of sets and their definitions are explained above with the help of examples.</p>

                        <h4>Empty Set</h4>
                        <p>In mathematics, empty set is a set theory related topic. A set without any elements is said to be an empty set. This article helps you understand empty set by giving a clear idea about empty set with some example problems.</p>

                        <h5>Empty Set Definition</h5>
                        <p>The other name of empty set is null set <span class="math-inline">\(\phi\)</span>. Consider two sets <span class="math-inline">\(X=\{a, b, c, d\}\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(Y=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)</span>. Consider another set <span class="math-inline">\(Z\)</span> which represents the intersection of <span class="math-inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(Y\)</span>. There is no common element for the set X and Y . So, intersection of X and Y is null.</p>
                        <p><strong><span class="math-inline">\(Z=\{ \} \quad\)</span> The representation of empty set is <span class="math-inline">\(\}\)</span>.</strong></p>

                        <h5>Empty Set or Null Set:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A set which does not contain any element is called an empty set, or the null set or the void set and it is denoted by <span class="math-inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> and is read as phi. In roster form, <span class="math-inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math-inline">\(\}\)</span>. An empty set is a finite set, since the number of elements in an empty set is finite, i.e., 0 .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example: (a) The set of whole numbers less than 0 .</p>
                        <p>(b) Clearly there is no whole number less than 0 .</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is an empty set.</p>
                        <p>(c) <span class="math-inline">\(N=\{x: x \in N, 3<x<4\}\)</span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let <span class="math-inline">\(A=\{x: 2<x<3, x\)</span> is a natural number}</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here A is an empty set because there isaio natural number between 2 and 3 .</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let <span class="math-inline">\(B=\{x: x\)</span> is a composite numbor less than 4}.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> is an empty set because there is no composite number less than 4.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">\(\emptyset \neq\{0\} \therefore\)</span> has no element.</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> is a set which has one element 0 .</p>
                        <p>The cardinal number of an empty set, i.e., <strong><span class="math-inline">\(n(\emptyset)=0\)</span></strong></p>

                        <h5>Cardinality of Empty Set:</h5>
                        <p>Since we know that the cardinal number represents the number of elements that are present in the set and by the definition of an empty set, we know that there are no element in the empty set. Hence, the cardinal number or cardinality of an empty is zero.</p>

                        <h5>Properties of Preparation for Empty Set:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Empty set is considered as subset of all sets. <span class="math-inline">\(\phi \subset X\)</span></li>
                            <li>Union of empty set <span class="math-inline">\(\phi\)</span> with a set X is X . <span class="math-inline">\(A \cup \phi=A\)</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Intersection of an empty set with a set X is an empty set.</p>

                        <h5>Solved Examples</h5>
                        <p>Question 1: <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span> is a set of alphabets and <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> is a set of numbers. What is the intersection of <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> ?</p>
                        <p>Solution: <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B}=\{ \}\)</span></p>
                        <p>Question 2: Write the set A which is a set of goats with 10 legs.</p>
                        <p>Solution: A = \{ \}</p>

                        <h5>Power Set of the Empty Set</h5>
                        <p>A set is called the power set of any set, if it contains all subsets of that set. We can use the notation <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{S})\)</span> for representing any power set of the set. Now, from the definition of an empty set, it is clear that there is no element in it and hence, the power set of an empty set i.e. <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{P}(\phi)\)</span> is the set which contain only one empty set, hence <span class="math-inline">\(P(\phi)=\{\phi\}\)</span></p>

                        <h5>Cartesian Product Empty Set</h5>
                        <p>The Cartesian product of any two sets say A and B are denoted by A X B. There are some conditions for Cartesian product of empty sets as follows:</p>
                        <p>If we have two sets A and B in such a way that both the sets are empty sets, then <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B}=\phi \times \phi=\phi\)</span>. It is clear that, the cartesian product of two empty sets is again an empty set.</p>
                        <p>If <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span> is an empty set and <span class="math-inline">\(B=\{1,2,3\}\)</span>, then the e cartesian product of <span class="math-inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span> is as follows: <span class="math-inline">\(\mathrm{A} \mathrm{XB}=\{\phi\} .\{1,2,3\}=\{\phi \mathrm{X} 1, \phi \mathrm{X} 2, \phi \times 3\}=\{\phi, \phi, \phi\}=\{\phi\}\)</span></p>
                        <p>So, we say that if one of the set is an empty set from the given two sets, then again the Cartesian product of these two sets is an empty set.</p>

                        <h5>Examples of Empty Sets</h5>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1850, George Boole, an English mathematician developed rules and theorems that became Boolean algebra.</p>
                        <p>Boole's work was an outcrop of work in physiology called LOGIC.</p>
                        <p>Logic can be used to break down complex problems to simple and understandable problems.</p>
                        <p>The binary nature of logic problems was studied by Cloude Shannon of MTI in 1938. Shannon applied Boolean algebra to relay logic switching circuits as means of realizing electric circuits.</p>
                        <p>Electric circuits used for digital computers are designed to generate only two voltage levels</p>
                        <p>Eg - high level ( ≈ 5V ) and low level ( ≈ 0V )</p>
                        <p>The binary number system requires two symbols hence its logical to identify a binary symbol with each voltage level. If we interpolate the high level as a binary 1and low level as a binary 0 , then we are using a positive logic system.</p>

                        <h3>Terminologies in Boolean Algebra</h3>
                        <!-- Note: MMD had 'logic function and logic gates' here, but it seems redundant with the h2 above. Keeping the h3 for structure. -->

                        <p>Logic circuit - A computer switching/électronic circuit that consists of a number of logic gates and performs logical operations on data</p>
                        <p>A logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs, and produces a single binary output. A logic gate is a small transistor circuit, basically a type of amplifier, which is implemented in different forms within an integrated circuit. Each type of gate has one or more (most often two) inputs and one output.</p>
                        <p>Boolean operation is any logical operation in which each of the operands and the result take one of two values, as "true" and "false" or "circuit on" and "circuit off."</p>
                        <blockquote> <!-- Using blockquote for the abstract -->
                            <p>A Boolean Function is a description of operation (logic operation) on algebraic expression called Boolean expression which consists of binary variables, the constants 0 and 1, carried out in digital/electronic circuits and the logic outputting there off. The logic operation is well expressed in truth tables.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>Truth tables</h3>
                        <p>A truth table is a breakdown of a logic function by listing all possible values the function can attain. Such a table typically contains several rows and columns, with the top row representing the logical variables and combinations, in increasing complexity leading up to the final function.</p>

                        <h3>Theorems of Boolean Algebra</h3>
                        <p>Boolean algebra deals with algebraic expressions between Boolean variables. Boolean algebra is a mathematical style dealing in logic. A fundamental rule relating to Boolean variables is called Boolean theorems.</p>

                        <p>The theorems are useful in simplifying expressions in which a product or sum of variables is complimented or inverted.</p>
                        <p>The two theorems are</p>
                        <p>a) <span class="math-inline">\((A+B)^{\prime}=A^{\prime} B^{\prime}\)</span></p>
                        <p>When the OR sum of two variables (A+B) is complimented, this is same as if the 2 variable's compliments were ANDed.</p>
                        <p>i.e. - compliment of an OR sum is AND product of the compliment.</p>
                        <p>b) <span class="math-inline">\((A B)^{\prime}=A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}\)</span></p>
                        <p>Compliment of an AND product is equal to OR sum of its compliment</p>

                        <h3>Karnaugh maps (K-maps)</h3>
                        <p>K-maps/ vetch diagram is a method to simplify Boolean expressions. The maps reduce the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of human pattern-recognition capability.</p>
                        <p>In K—map, the Boolean variables are transferred (generally from a truth table) and ordered according to the principles of gray code in which only one variable changes in between squares.</p>
                        <p>Once the table is generated and the output possibilities transcribed, the data is arranged into the largest possible groups containing <span class="math-inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> cells ( n=0,1,2,3... ) and the minterms generated through the axiom laws of Boolean algebra</p>

                        <h4>Note</h4>
                        <p>A minterm is a product (AND) of all variables in the function, in directs or complemented form. A minterm has the property that it is equal to 1 on exactly one row of the truth table.</p>
                        <p>A maxterm is a sum (OR) of all the variables in the function, in direct or complemented form. A maxterm has the property that it is equal to 0 on exactly one row of the truth table.</p>
                        <p>Don't care conditions are represented by X in the K-Map table. A don't-care term for a function is an input-sequence (a series of bits) for which the function output does not matter ( 0,1 ).</p>

                        <h4>Procedure</h4>
                        <p>K-map method may theoretically be applied to simplify any Boolean expression through works well with <=6 variable.</p>

                        <h4>Note</h4>
                        <p>Each group provides a "product" to create a "SOP" in the Boolean expression. To determine the inverse of the K-map, the 0's are grouped instead of the 1's. the two expressions are noncomplementary.</p>
                        <p>Each square in a K-map corresponds to a minterm and maxterm in the venn diagram.</p>
