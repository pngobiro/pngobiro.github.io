                        <p>Semiconductor materials are used to make a range of devices that are used in modern electronic circuits. In order to understand hôw these devices work we must first gain an understanding of the electrical properties of naturally occurring (intrinsic) semiconductors. We then need to learn about the electrical properties of extrinsic semiconductors. Extrinsic semiconductor material is just a naturally occurring pure semiconductor material that has been modified by a manufacturing process.</p>
                        <p>First we will look at the atomic structure of intrinsic semiconductors to understand their electrical properties. Then we will look at how this structure is modified to produce extrinsic semiconductor material and how this changes the materials electrical properties. Finally we will look at the construction and operation of a semiconductor diode which is the most basic semiconductor device used in electronic circuits. During this section we will consider "true" electron flow rather than conventional current flow which is used in electrical circuit analysis.</p>

                        <p>An atom can be thought of as a central positively charged nucleus orbited by negatively charged electrons. The positive charge of the nucleus is due to the positively charged protons it contains. For an atom in its natural state the total negative charge of the electrons is equal in magnitude to the positive charge of the nucleus. Therefore the atom is electrically neutral. The orbits of the electrons are arranged in shells. The first shell is closest to the nucleus and contains a maximum of two electrons. The next outer shell contains a maximum of eight electrons. The next shell also contains a maximum of eight electrons.</p>

                        <p>Semiconductors are group four elements i.e. they have four electrons in their outermost shell. (The electrons in the outer shell of an atom are called valence electrons). Note it is important to point out that the element groups refer to the number of electrons in the outermost shell of the atom, the total number of electrons in the atom can be greater ie for atoms that have inner shells that also contain electrons. Also many atoms have less electrons in their outer shell than the maximum number that the shell can hold. e.g. for group 4 materials silicon and germanium the outer shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons so the outer shell is only half full. The outer shell of the atom is more stable when the it is completely full.</p>

                        <h3>Intrinsic semiconductor materials</h3>
                        <p>The naturally occurring semiconductor materials that are used to manufacture electronic devices are Silicon and Germanium (Germanium is an older choice of material which is less used today). The following text refers to silicon but is equally applicable to germanium.</p>

                        <h4>Pure Silicon</h4>
                        <p>First a very pure crystal of silicon must be produced. The atomic structure of the silicon can be represented by the diagram below. Silicon like all semiconductors is a group 4 element and its atoms have only four electrons in the outer shell ( 4 valence electrons). It takes eight electrons to fill the outer shell and make it stable. The atoms share their valence electrons with neighbouring atoms so that each atom effectively contains eight electrons in the outer shell. This sharing of valence electrons with neighbouring atoms forms covalent bonds. It is these covalent bonds that bind the atoms together.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-22.jpg" alt="Covalent bonding in Silicon lattice">
                            <figcaption>[Covalent bonding in Silicon lattice]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The silicon atoms form a square lattice</li>
                            <li>Each silicon nucleus has four electrons in its outer shell</li>
                            <li>These electrons are paired with the corresponding electrons in adjacent atoms.</li>
                            <li>These are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are what binds the material together</li>
                            <li>The net result is that each nuclei (along with the electrons in the inner shells) are surrounded by eight outer electrons tightly bound in the atomic structure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note this is a simplified diagram showing a 2 dimensional representation of the structure of silicon. Obviously silicon has a 3 dimensional structure and the covalent bonds do not really lie in a single plane as shown in the diagram. The actual arrangement of covalent bonds forms a shape called a tetrahedron.</p>
                        <p>This diagram does give a good representation of how the electrons are bound to the atoms. This reflects the fact that there are no free electrons to produce an electrical current if a voltage is applied to the material. However an energy level diagram is better for explaining more about the electrical properties of silicon.</p>

                        <h3>Energy band diagrams</h3>
                        <p>Energy band diagrams show the energy levels of the electrons in the material. We are only interested in two of the bands, the conduction band and the valence band. The valence band is occupied by the electrons with the highest energy level of those which are still attached to their parent atoms, these are the outer most (or valence) electrons. The conduction band is occupied by electrons which are free from their parent atoms. These electrons are free to move through the material. (When a voltage is applied these electrons will drift to produce an electrical current.) In semiconductors there is an gap between the valence and conduction bands. This energy gap reflects the amount of energy that would be needed to remove an electron from it's parent atom (ie to transfer it from the valence to the conduction band).</p>

                        <h4>Energy band diagram for silicon</h4>
                        <p>The number of valence electrons in the pure silicon is enough to completely fill the valence band (so no movement of electrons can occur in the valence band). There are no free electrons, therefore the conduction band is completely empty.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Electron-Hole pair generation</h3>
                        <p>As previously stated there is an energy gap between the conduction and valence band in semiconductors. However the energy required to jump this gap can be supplied to the electrons from heat energy. (This means that if the material is heated some electrons will acquire enough energy to break free of their parent atoms to become free electrons.) At room temperature some electrons will have acquired the energy to jump into the conduction band. If the temperature is increased so will the number of electrons in the conduction band. This process is called electron-hole pair generation. This is because by supplying energy we transfer an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. This produces a free electron in the conduction band and leaves a hole (vacant electron position) in the valence band.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-25.jpg" alt="Electron-hole pair generation due to thermal energy">
                            <figcaption>[Electron-hole pair generation due to thermal energy]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The free electrons are now available to contribute to an electrical current if a voltage is applied to the material. Also the holes (the vacant electron positions) in the valence band will now allow movement of electrons in the valence band, this can also contribute to an electrical current. The net effect is that heat increases the conduction properties of a pure semiconductor.</p>

                        <h3>Holes (virtual particles!)</h3>
                        <p>The movement of electrons in the valence band is complicated and as they move to fill the vacant electron positions the position of the hole appears to move in the opposite direction to the electrons. In fact it is easier to consider the movement of the hole and we can imagine it to be a positively charged particle because of the direction it moves in (opposite to that of negatively charged electrons).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-26.jpg" alt="Concept of hole movement in valence band">
                            <figcaption>[Concept of hole movement in valence band]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>At first this may seem a strange idea but later you will see that by considering the movement of these virtual particles it is much easier to understand how semiconductor devices work. However it is important to remember that although we regard holes as positively charged particles they are not real particles and all the effects we see are actually caused by the movement of electrons in the valence baid.</p>
                        <p>When an external voltage is applieâ the negatively charged electrons in the conduction band will move towards the positive terminal and the positively charge holes in the valence band will move towards the negative terminal.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-27.jpg" alt="Movement of electrons and holes under applied voltage">
                            <figcaption>[Movement of electrons and holes under applied voltage]</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h4>Leakage current</h4>
                        <p>It is important to realise that although electron-hole pair generation in semiconductors means that there will be some current flow when a voltage is applied, this current is very small (typically millionths of an Amp) compared to the current which would flow through a conductor with the same voltage applied. This current is called leakage current.</p>

                        <h4>Comparison of Silicon and Germanium</h4>
                        <p>All of the above applies equally to both Silicon and Germanium except for the actual value of leakage current. Germanium has a smaller energy gap between the valence and conduction band. Therefore more electron hole pairs are produced in Germanium resulting in a higher leakage current at any given temperature.</p>

                        <h4>Comparison of Conductor, semiconductor and insulator energy band diagrams</h4>
                        <p>In conductors the valence band and conduction band overlap therefore electrons can move freely into the conduction band. The vast number of electrons in the conduction band drift to produce large currents when a voltage is applied. In insulators the energy gap between the valence and conduction band is very large. Therefore very few electrons manage to jump into the conduction band and leakage currents are extremely small.</p>

                        <h3>Electrical breakdown</h3>
                        <p>It is important to point out that when we are describing the conduction properties of materials we are considering fairly normal operating conditions and we are not talking about situations involving extreme voltages. Air for instance is an excellent insulator, however in thunderstorms voltages in the order of a hundred million volts can force a current through the air in the form of a lightning bolt. It would not take such an extremfe voltage to break down a small piece of silicon and force it to conduct electricity. There are two stages that occur as a material begins to breakdown due a large applied voltage. These are zener breakdown and avalanche breakdown.</p>

                        <h4>Zener breakdown</h4>
                        <p>In Zener breakdown the electrostatic attraction between the negative electrons and a large positive voltage is so great that it pulls electrons out of their covalent bonds and away from their parent atoms. ie Electrons are transferred from the valence to the conduction band. In this situation the current can still be limited by the limited number of free electrons produced by the applied voltage so it is possible to cause Zener breakdown without damaging the semiconductor.</p>

                        <h4>Avalanche breakdown</h4>
                        <p>Avalanche breakdown occurs when the applied voltage is so large that electrons that are pulled from their covalent bonds are accelerated to great velocities. These electrons collide with the silicon atoms and knock off more electrons. These electrons are then also accelerated and subsequently collide with other atoms. Each collision produces more electrons which leads to more collisions etc. The current in the semiconductor rapidly increases and the material can quickly be destroyed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To produce extrinsic semiconductor material specific amounts of impurity are added to the pure intrinsic semiconductor. This process is called doping and the impurity atoms are called donor atoms. There are two types of extrinsic semiconductor which are manufactured, P type semiconductor and N type semiconductor. The production of extrinsic semiconductor will be described for the more common silicon semiconducior material but the process is identical for germanium.</p>

                        <h3>N type semiconductor</h3>
                        <p>The pure silicon is doped with a group 5 element such as phosphorus, antimony or arsenic. These materials have atoms with five valence electrons (pentavalent atoms). Four of these electrons will form covalent bonds with neighbouring silicon atoms. As their are only four covalent bonds binding the donor atom to the neighbouring silicon atoms the fifth electron is not part of a covalent bond, and is therefore a free electron. Every impurity atom will produce a free electron in the conduction band. These electrons will drift to produce an electrical current if a voltage is applied to the material and the N type semiconductor is a much better conductor than the intrinsic pure silicon material.</p>

                        <p>Note it is important to point out that the material is called N type semiconductor because the majority of charge carriers which will contribute to an electrical current through the material are negatively charged free electrons produced by the doping process. There will be some contribution to the current flow from positively charge holes due to electron hole pair generation but these holes are the minority charge carriers in this material. The <strong>N</strong> type material itself is not negatively charged. The negative charge of the electrons of the donor atoms is balanced by the positive charge in the nucleus.</p>

                        <h3>P type semiconductor</h3>
                        <p>The pure silicon is doped with a group 3 element such as boron, aluminium or indium. These materials have atoms with three valence electrons (trivalent atoms). The three electrons will form covalent bonds with neighbouring silicon atoms. However there are not enough electrons to form the fourth covalent bond. This leaves a hole in the covalent bond structure and therefore a hole in the valence band of the energy level diagram. Every impurity atom will produce a hole in the valence band. These holes will drift to produce an electrical current if a voltage is applied to the material and the P type semiconductor is a much better conductor than the intrinsic pure silicon material.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">5. The PN junction diode & Operation</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Understanding the operation of the semiconductor diode is the basis for an understanding of all semiconductor devices. The diode is actually manufactured as a single piece of material but it is much easier to explain the operation if we imagine producing two separate pieces of N type and P type material and then "sticking" them together.</p>
                        <p>Consider a piece of N type material. It contains mobile charge carriers in the form of free electrons. These electrons will be in motion due to thermal energy. (It is important to realise that this motion does not result in an electrical current because the motion is random and there is not net movement of charge from one area of the material to another. This is similar to the way that even in a perfectly still glass of water the individual molecules will be moving randomly on a microscopic scale.) The net result is that the random motion of the electrons results in them being evenly distributed throughout the N typeđiaterial. In the P type material it is the positively charged holes that are mobile and for identical reasons to those previously described the holes are evenly distributed throughout the P type material.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-33.jpg" alt="Separate P and N type materials before joining">
                            <figcaption>[Separate P and N type materials before joining]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Now consider what will happen if these two separate pieces of <span class="math-inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math-inline">\(N\)</span> type material are joined together. The random motion of the mobile electrons in the N type material and the holes in the P type material would tend to cause an even distribution of electrons and holes throughout the semiconductor. And in fact this is what begins to happen.</p>
                        <p>Consider the electrons in the N type material. The electrons start to migrate across the junction of the two materials. When they cross into the P type material they recombine with the holes (ie they fill in the holes in the valence band by filling in the vacant electron positions around the trivalent donor atoms). This means that the number of holes near to the junction becomes depleted. Also as the electrons leave the previously neutral N type material a positive charge builds up at the junction. (This is because the positive charge from the nucleus of atoms near to the junction is now greater than the negative charge of the electrons in that region. This is due to the reduction in the number of electrons due to those which have moved across the junction.)</p>
                        <p>Similarly as holes migrate from the P to N type material they recombine with electrons (the free electron from the pentavalent atoms completes the fourth covalent bond around the trivalent atom). This leaves a depletion of free electrons near the junction in the N type material. Also a negative charge builds up near the junction in the <span class="math-inline">\(P\)</span> type material due to the loss of positively charged holes.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-34.jpg" alt="Formation of depletion region and barrier voltage at PN junction">
                            <figcaption>[Formation of depletion region and barrier voltage at PN junction]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The net result is that the migration of electrons from N to P type material and the migration of holes from P to N has two effects. It results in a depletion of mobile charge carriers near the junction ( a depletion of electrons in the N type material and a depletion of holes in the P type material). This depletion layer is typically about 1 micrometre wide ( 1 millionth of a meter!). Also a voltage is produce across the junction which is called a barrier voltage. The N type material develops a positive charge close to the junction and the <span class="math-inline">\(P\)</span> type develops a negative charge. This prevents any further migration of mobile charge carriers.</p>

                        <h4>The effect of the barrier voltage</h4>
                        <p>The positive charge at the N side of the junction repels any positively charged holes that would tend to migrate across the junction from the P type material. It also attracts free electrons and therefore to prevents them moving out of the N type material. Similarly the negative charge in the P type material close to the junction repels electrons which would tend to migrate from the N type material and it attracts the holes and prevents them moving out of the P type material. The migration of mobile charge carriers across the junction would stop when the barrier voltage had built up to a sufficient level to prevent any further migration. For Silicon this is about 0.6 to 0.7 volts for Germanium it is about 0.2 to 0.3 volts.</p>

                        <h3>Reverse Bias</h3>
                        <p>Consider applying an external voltage to the diode as shown below with the positive terminal connected to the N type material and the negative terminal connected to the P type material. The external voltage would tend to cause the movement of electrons from the negative terminal of the supply through the diode and back to the positive terminal (electron flow).</p>
                        <p>To do this the negative terminal would tend to inject electrons into the <span class="math-inline">\(P\)</span> type material causing a further depletion of holes. This would produce a widening of the depletion layer and an increase in the negative charge at the junction until it was equal in magnitude to the applied voltage. The negative charge at the junction would oppose the negative terminal of the external voltage and this would prevent any further injection of electrons into the <span class="math-inline">\(P\)</span> type material.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-35.jpg" alt="PN junction under reverse bias">
                            <figcaption>[PN junction under reverse bias]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Similarly, the positive terminal would tend to pull electrons from the N type material. This would further deplete the N type material of electrons, widening the depletion layer and increasing the positive charge at the junction until it was equal to the magnitude of the applied voltage. This would then prevent any further loss of electrons.</p>
                        <p>The net effect is that when an external voltage isconnected this way the effect of the barrier voltage opposes the external voltage. Any inifíal movement of charge due to the external voltage will just increase the barrier voltage until it is equal to the applied voltage and therefore no current will flow through the diode. When an external voltage is connected to a diode with this polarity we say that it is reverse biased.</p>
                        <p>Note as holes are the majority current carriers in P type material it is more common to consider the movement of holes rather than electrons in the P type material. Therefore we can say that the negative terminal tends to remove holes rather than injecting electrons in the same way that we considered the positive terminal removing electrons from the N type material. The effect is the same, the removal of holes from the P type material would increase the depletion layer and increase the barrier voltage.</p>

                        <h3>Forward bias</h3>
                        <p>Consider applying an external voltage to the diode as shown below with the positive terminal connected to the P type material and the negative terminal connected to the N type material. The external voltage would tend to cause the movement of electrons from the negative terminal of the supply through the diode and back to the positive terminal (electron flow).</p>
                        <p>The negative terminal would tend to inject electrons into the N type material. This would increase the number of electrons and therefore reduce depletion layer. This would reduce the positive charge at the junction. Similarly the positive terminal would tend to pull electrons from the P type material. This would increase the number of holes, reducing the depletion layer and reducing the negative charge at the junction.</p>
                        <p>The net effect is that when the external voltage is connected this way it reduces the barrier voltage and if the applied voltage is greater than the barrier voltage it will overcome it and produce a current flow through the diode. When an external voltage is connected to a diode with this polarity we say that it is forward biased.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-36.jpg" alt="PN junction under forward bias">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Note as holes are the majority current carriers inc type material it is more common to consider the movement of holes rather than electrons in the P type material. Therefore we can say that the positive terminal injects holes rather than removes electrons in the same way that we considered the negative terminal injecting electrons into the N type material. The effect is the same the injection of holes would reduce the depletion layer and reduce the barrier voltage.</p>

                        <h3>Diode Characteristic</h3>
                        <p>A diode characteristic is simply a graph of the voltage applied to a diode and the current it produces. The negative part of the voltage axis corresponds to when the diode is reverse biased and the positive part is when the diode is forward biased. The negative part of the current axis shows current flowing in the reverse direction through the diode.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/image-37.jpg" alt="Diode I-V characteristic curve">
                            <figcaption>[Diode I-V characteristic curve]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The main features of the characteristic are:</li>
                            <li>No current flows when the diode is forward biased until the barrier voltage is overcome ( <span class="math-inline">\(0.6 \mathrm{~V}-0.7 \mathrm{~V}\)</span> for silicon <span class="math-inline">\(0.2 \mathrm{~V}-0.3 \mathrm{~V}\)</span> for germanium)</li>
                            <li>The forward characteristic is non linear (not a straight line). This shows that the resistance is not constant.</li>
                            <li>the gradient of the forward characteristic quickly becomes very steep. This shows that the forward resistance is very low</li>
                            <li>The negative current axis is on a different scale (showing millionths of an amp rather than thousandths) this is so we can indicate the very small leakage current which flows due to electron hole pair generation (ie due to the natural conduction properties of the pure silicon). The leakage current flows in both directions but is too small to indicate on the current scale used on the forward part of the characteristic</li>
                            <li>If a large enough reversed bias voltage is applied the diode will eventually conduct due to zener then avalanche breakdown (ie due to the natural conduction properties of the pure silicon). The actually voltage that breakdown occurs varies for individual diodes and can be determined by the manufacturing process</li>
