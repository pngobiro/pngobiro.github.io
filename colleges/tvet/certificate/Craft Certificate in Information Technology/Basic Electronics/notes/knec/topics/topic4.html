                        <p>An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields. Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form and are not to be confused with electrical elements, which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components.</p>
                        <p>Electronic components have a number of electrical terminals or leads. These leads connect to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). Basic electronic components may be packaged discretely, as arrays or networks of like components, or integrated inside of packages such as semiconductor integrated circuits, hybrid integrated circuits, or thick film devices. The following list of electronic components focuses on the discrete version of these components, treating such packages as components in their owner right.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Classification & Application of Electronic Components</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Components can be classified as passive, active, or electromechanic. The strict physics definition treats passive components as ones that cannot supply energy themselves, whereas a battery would be seen as an active component since it truly acts as a source of energy.</p>
                        <p>However, electronic engineers who perform circuit analysis use a more restrictive definition of passivity. When only concerned with the energy of signals, it is convenient to ignore the socalled DC circuit and pretend that the power supplying components such as transistors or integrated circuits is absent (as if each such component had its own battery built in), though it may in reality be supplied by the DC circuit. Then, the analysis only concerns the AC circuit, an abstraction that ignores DC voltages and currents (and the power associated with them) present in the real-life circuit. This fiction, for instance, lets us view an oscillator as "producing energy" even though in reality the oscillator consumes even more energy from a DC power supply, which we have chosen to ignore. Under that restriction, we define the terms as used in circuit analysis as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Active components</strong> rely on a source of energy (usually from the DC circuit, which we have chosen to ignore) and usually can inject power into a circuit, though this is not part of the definition. Active components include amplifying components such as transistors, triode vacuum tubes (valves), and tunnel diodes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Passive components</strong> can't introduce net energy into the circuit. They also can't rely on a source of power, except for what is available from the (AC) circuit they are connected to. As a consequence they can't amplify (increase the power of a signal), although they may increase a voltage or current (such as is done by a transformer or resonant circuit). Passive components include two-terminal components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electromechanical components</strong> can carry out electrical operations by using moving parts or by using electrical connections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most passive components with more than two terminals can be described in terms of two-port parameters that satisfy the principle of reciprocity-though there are rare exceptions. In contrast, active components (with more than two terminals) generally lack that property.</p>

                        <p>Resistors- a device that limits the VMS applied voltage per unit VMS current flowing</p>
                        <p>-a device that measures the applied voltage per unit current, flowing in a connection terminal.</p>
                        <p>We have 2types of resistors</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>fixed resistor</li>
                            <li>variance resistors</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Fixed resistors -include wire wound carbon cofiposition, cracked carbon and tin-oxide resistors .have a fixed resistor</p>
                        <p>Variable resistors- a device with 3 terninals and resistance maybe measured at the two outer terminals and its value maybe valid</p>
                        <p>Include thermostat, meter bridges etc.</p>

                        <h4>Color coding</h4>
                        <p>The value of fixed resistors is usually indicated by color code.</p>
                        <p>The first color of this indicates the first digit of value of the resistor.</p>
                        <p>The second color the second digit and the third color indicates the number of zeros that follow the digit. A fourth color is often used to indicate tolerance limit of the resistor (if no four color, tolerance is taken as+- 20%)</p>

                        <p>Passive devices - a device that is dependant of external power supply. They do not produce their own energy. I.e. resistors, capacitors etc</p>
                        <p>A capacitor is a passive electric component consisting of a pair of conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator) phase is PF (voltage) aross the conductors a static electricity field develops in the dielectric that stores energy and produces a mechanical force between the conductors. An ideal capacitor is charácterized by a single constant value, capacitance, measured in fours. This is the ratio of the electric charge on each conductor to the PD between them.</p>

                        <h4>Application</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Electric circuits for blocking direct current, while allowing alternating current to pass.</li>

                        <p>A capacitor is assumed to be self contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field.</p>
                        <p>The conductors' turns held equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces</p>
                        <p>And the dielectric develops an electric field in SI units a capacitor of one favad means that one connomb or charges each conductor lunches a voltage of one volt across the device.</p>

                        <h4>Current voltage relationship</h4>
                        <p>The current <span class="math-inline">\(c(t)\)</span> through any component Eelectriric CCT is defined as the rate of flow of charge <span class="math-inline">\(Q(t)\)</span> passing through it but actual charges electrons can not pass through it but actual charged, electrons cumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate ,resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charges on one electrode that is equal and positive to the accumulated negative charges on the other.</p>
                        <p>Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as propositional to the voltage.</p>

                        <p>An inductor/reactor is a passive electrical component that can store energy in a magnetic field created by the electric current passing through it. An inductor's ability to store magnetic energy is measured by its inductance, in units of henries.</p>
                        <p>An inductor is a conducting wire shaped as a coil, the loops helping to create a strong magnetic field inside the coil that induce a voltage that apposes the change in current. The current and voltage in an inductor change in time.</p>

                        <h4>Operation:</h4>
                        <p>Inductance (L) is an effect resulting from the magnetic field that forms around a current-currying conductor which tends to resist change in the current.Electric current through the conductor creates a magnetic flux proportional to the current and a change in this current creates a corresponding change in magnetic flux which in turn generates an electromotive force (EMF) that oppose this change in current.</p>
                        <p>Inductance is a measure of the amount <span class="math-inline">\(\rho\)</span> EMF generated per unit Change in current.</p>
                        <p>i.e. - an inductor with inductance of 1henry produce an EMF of 1 V when the current through the inductor change at the rate of <span class="math-inline">\(1 \mathrm{amp} / \mathrm{sec}\)</span></p>

                        <h4>Types of inductors</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Air core coil</strong> - the term refers to a coil wound on plastic, ceramic or other non magnetic forms as well as those that actually have air inside the wounding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radio frequency inductor</strong> - RF, mostly are air core types but with specialized construction to minimize power loss</li>
                            <li><strong>Ferro magnetic core</strong> - iron core, inductors using a magnetic core of ferromagnetic material such as iron or ferrite to increase inductance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laminated core inductor</strong> - the core is made of stacks of thin steel sheets or laminations oriented parallel to the filed, with an insulating coating on the surface to avoid power loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ferrite core inductor</strong> - ferrite is a ceramic ferromagnetic material that is non conductive so eddy current cannot flow within it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Steroidal coils</strong> - for higher magnetic fields and inductance, we carry out windings of a coil on a steroidal or doughnut shaped ferrite core. The magnetic field lines form crossed loops within the doughnut without leaving the core material. Since little of their magnetic flux is outside the core, they radiate less electromagnetic interference than straight coils.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variable inductor</strong> - a variable inductor can be constructed by making one of the terminals of the device a sliding spring contact that can move along the surface of the coil, increasing/decreasing the number of turns of the coil in the circuit. An alternative construction method is to use a movable magnetic core which can slide in or out of the coil; moving the core further into the coil increase permeability thus inductance</li>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">4. Transformer</h3>
                        <p>A device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors - the transformer coils.</p>
                        <p>A varying current in the first(primary winding) creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core, and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electrical force (EMF) or voltage in the secondary winding. This effect is called induction.</p>
                        <p>Note If in the secondary coil, there develops a magnetic field that will induce a voltage to appose the change in current, then the effect is called self induction.</p>

                        <p>If the secondary coil is attached to a load, that allows current to flow , electrical power is transmitted from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit.</p>
                        <p>Ideally, the transformer is perfectly efficient; all the incoming energy is transformed from the primary circuit to the magnetic field and into the secondary circuit. If this condition is met, the incoming electric power must equal to outgoing power.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, normally silicon. The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper, and faster than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability and buildingblock approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Merits and Demerits of ICs</h3>

                        <h4>Advantages of Integrated Circuits</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Miniature in size. As fabrication process is used for the integration of active and passive components on to a silicon chip, the IC becomes á lot smaller. When compared to a discrete circuit, it may be at least a thousand times smaller.</li>
                            <li>Due to small size, the weight of the IC also reduces, when compared to the discrete circuit.</li>
                            <li>To produce hundreds of discrete circuits on a PCB for the same logic takes more time and increase the cost factor. But for the production of hundreds of IC's the cost of production will be very low and less time consuming.</li>
                            <li>The PCB consisting soldered joints will be less reliable. This problem is omitted in IC's because of no soldered joints, with fewer interconnections, and thus highly reliable.</li>
                            <li>The small size of IC's causes lesser power consumption and lesser power loss.</li>
                            <li>In a discrete circuitry, if a single transistor becomes faulty, the whole circuit may fail to work. This transistor has to be desoldered and replaced. It is difficult to find out which component has failed. This problem can be omitted in an IC by replacing an entire IC as it is low in cost.</li>
                            <li>Increased operating speed because of absence of parasitic capacitance effect.</li>
                            <li>As the IC's are produced in bulk the temperature coefficients and other parameters will be closely matching.</li>
                            <li>Improved functional performance as more complex circuits can be fabricated for achieving better characteristics.</li>
                            <li>All IC's are tested for operating ranges in very low and very high temperatures.</li>
                            <li>As all the components are fabricated very close to each other in an IC, they are highly suitable for small signal operation, as there won't be any stray electrical pickup.</li>
                            <li>As all the components are fabricated inside the chip, there will not be any external projections.</li>

                        <h4>Disadvantages of Integrated Circuits</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Some complex IC's maybe costly. If such integrated circuits are used roughly and become faulty, they have to be replaced by a new one. They cannot be repaired as the individual components inside the IC are too small.</li>
                            <li>The power rating for most of the IC's does not exceed more than 10 watts. Thus it is not possible to manufacture high power IC's.</li>
                            <li>Some components like transformers and inductors cannot be integrated into an IC. They have to be connected externally to the semiconductor pins.</li>
                            <li>High grade P-N-P assembly is not possible.</li>
                            <li>The IC will not work properly if wrongly handled or exposed to excessive heat.</li>
                            <li>It is difficult to achieve low temperature coefficient.</li>
                            <li>It is difficult to fabricate an IC with low noise.</li>
                            <li>It is not possible to fabricate capacitors that exceed a value of 30 pF . Thus, high value capacitors are to be connected externally to the IC.</li>
                            <li>There is a large value of saturation resistance of transistors.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Fan out:</strong> Fan out specifies the number of standard loads that the output of the gate can drive without impairment of its normal operation</li>
                            <li><strong>Power dissipation:</strong> Power dissipation is measure of power consumed by the gate when fully driven by all its inputs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Propagation Delay:</strong> Propagation delay is the average transition delay time for the signal to propagate from input to output when the signals change in value. It is expressed in ns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Noise Margin:</strong> It is the maximum noise voltage added to an input signal of a digital circuit that does not cause an undesirable change in the circuit output. It is expressed in volts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fan In:</strong> Fan in is the number of inputs connected to the gate without any degradation in the voltage level.</li>
                            <li><strong>Operating temperature:</strong> All the gates or semiconductor devices are temperature sensitive in nature. The temperature in which the performance of the IC is effective is called as operating temperature. Operating temperature of the IC vary from 00 C to 700 c .</li>
                            <li>Power supply requirements</li>
