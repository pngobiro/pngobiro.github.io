                        <p>It is a process of devising new idea or a thing or improving on the existing ideas. Innovation is the process of doing a new thing, bring new idea into fruition. Innovation is therefore the transformation of creative ideas in to useful application but creativity is a prerequisite for innovation. Innovation turn new ideas into reality. It disrupts the existing status quo. It transforms new ideas into useful application by combining resources in a new or unusual ways to provide the value to the society for the improved products, technology or services.</p>

                        <p>Peter Drucker (1986) Identified seven sources of innovation. They include:</p> <!-- Corrected Drunker, seem -->

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>The expected /unforeseen</strong><br>Whatever is foreseen whether good or bad presents an opportunity for innovation. Innovation may come from the unexpected failure or success of the product which is called the unexpected occurrences for example IBM (The International Business Machines) in the 1990’s developed machine for accounting for the products which were meant for the banks but the banks would not use it for this. Later the company in 1930’s developed a computer for business use this is an example of unexpected success. Unexpected event in the business would present the opportunity for the business to innovate for example the post-election violence.</span>

This is especially the industry and the market structure were relatively stable for several years and they start to disintegrate. This would be as a result of extensive rivalry, threats of new entrants and the development of the substitute products. New entrants may bring the substitute products and this may force the business to innovate.</span>

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Creativity</h3>
                        <p>This is the process which leads to new ideas and knowledge. Creativity is the ability to bring something new into existence. It is about new ideas. This is where the imaginative people generate the ideas then they develop them successful. Creativity is a process of coming up with the business idea. Creativity is a requisite for innovation. Innovation is the commercial exploitation of the idea.</p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">Creative process</h4>
                        <p>Ideas usually evolve through a creative process whereby imaginative people germinate the ideas, nurture them and develop them successfully. David Holt (1991) identified the following stages in the creative process:</p>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Idea generation</strong><br>This is where an individual become curious about a specific problem or area of study.

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Preparation</strong><br>This is about getting the mind to be ready to think.
