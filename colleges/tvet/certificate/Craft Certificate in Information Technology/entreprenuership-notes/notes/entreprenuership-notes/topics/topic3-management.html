                                <p>This is the grant of the property rights that is given by the government for an invention. It gives exclusive rights to an inventor to exploit an invention within an agreed period of time. Patents have been distinguished as assets of commercial value because they can be sold, transferred or used as collateral in case of a loan. The patent law stipulates what can be patented and what cannot be patented. According to the statutes any person who innovates or discovers something new or useful can apply for the patent right. For anything to be patentable it must be new, useful and it has a demonstrated function.</p>
