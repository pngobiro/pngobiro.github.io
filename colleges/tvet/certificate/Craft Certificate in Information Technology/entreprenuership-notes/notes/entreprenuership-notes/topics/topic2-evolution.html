Although there were attempts by the government to develop the entrepreneurship the main impetus come from the ILO (The International Labor Organization report). The report centered on the potential of the informal sector and suggested that the bulk of Kenyan‚Äôs urban workers were self-employed in the small enterprise.

An entrepreneur is a person which a foresight and competence to operate in conditions of uncertainty. An entrepreneur exercises judgment in the face of uncertainty. He argued that they normally lease land, employ labor and the inputs and to produce the output for the market for the produce and the prices of the output to be above the costs of production. Cantillon contributed to the contention that the entrepreneur is a person with foresight and the confidence to operate in the conditions of uncertainty. He associates the risks and the uncertainty with the administrative decision of the entrepreneur. He viewed the origin of entrepreneurship as there been no foresight. He emphasized the function and not the person whose social standing was irrelevant.</p>

An entrepreneur coordinates and combines the factors of production. He redeploys resources and make them more productive and gives them value. In addition to tackling risks against uncertainty the entrepreneur must surmount abundant of obstacles, suppress the uncertainties, repair the misfortunes and devise expedients. The results is the entrepreneur accommodates the unexpected and overcomes the problems successfully in their dealing with the input and the output market. He concludes that the entrepreneur is an allocator of resources in the adjustment process during the disequilibrium to equilibrium. He gives three roles of the entrepreneur in the entrepreneurship process:</p>

                                        <p>One of the concentrated school of thought is the Chicago school of thought spearheaded by Frank Knight. The school borrows from the early thinking of an entrepreneur by Cantillon (1755 - Corrected date based on context) and J B Say (1803). It describes the entrepreneur as a risk taker whose motivation is profit maximization. However it does not draw a clear line between entrepreneurship and capitalist.</p>

                                        <p>The school was spearheaded by Israel Kirzner (1973 - Corrected date based on context). Kirzner thought that the market was already at equilibrium and the entrepreneur role was to intervene to bring them to equilibrium. They argued that the entrepreneur needs information to be able to make the correct decision in allocating the resources. According to Kirzner one of the key qualities of the entrepreneur was alertness. Alertness was seen as function of the vision of the market and the entrepreneur had superior knowledge which enabled them to identify feasible opportunities. They gain those superior knowledge through participation into the market and the investment into information. Form this point of view he emphasized the application of arbitraging (buying low and selling high).</p>

He introduced the notion that the entrepreneur is not only the allocator or the director of the resources but combine the input in untried combination (innovator). Schumpeter asserted that the entrepreneur only remained an entrepreneur for has long as he is innovative and losses that characters when the business fall into the routine management of the business.</p> <!-- Corrected 'man agreement' -->
