The report proposed the development of the sector could

\section*{Theories of entrepreneurship}

\section*{ECONOMIST SCHOOL OF THOUGHT}

The economists have debated the role of entrepreneurship and as resulted into the classical and the neo classical schools of thought

\section*{a)Classical economists}

\section*{i)Richard cantillon}

Richard Cantillon defined(1680-1734) three economic agents namely the land owners entrepreneurs and the laborers who engage in the market exchange in order to make a profits while assuming the accompanying risks in the entrepreneurship.An entrepreneur is a person which a foresight and competence to operate in conditions of uncertainty An entrepreneur exercises judgment in the face of uncertainty .He argued that they normally lease land ,employ labor and the inputs and to produce the output for the market for the produce and the prices of the output to be above the costs of production .Cantillon contributed to the contention that the entrepreneur is a person with foresight and the confidence to operate in the conditions of uncertainty. He associates the risks and the uncertainty with the administrative decision of the entrepreneur. He viewed the origin of entrepreneurship as there been no foresight He emphasized the function and not the person whose social standing was irrelevant

\section*{ii) John Baptiste}

John Baptiste defined an entrepreneur as one who consciously moves resources form one area pf lower productivity to an area of higher productivity .An entrepreneur coordinates and combines the factors of production. He redeploys resources and make them more productive and gives them value. In addition to tackling risks against uncertainty the entrepreneur must surmount abundant of obstacles, suppress the uncertainties, repair the misfortunes and devise expedients .The results is the entrepreneur accommodates the unexpected and overcomes the problems successfully in their dealing with the input and the output market. He concludes that the entrepreneur is an allocator of resources in the adjustment process during the disequilibrium to equilibrium. He gives three roles of the entrepreneur in the entrepreneurship process
i) Entrepreneurship role- involves the generating of ideas for a profit
ii) Investment role- put in capital for dividend and capital gains
iii) Management roles -require skills and supervision for the income

\section*{b) Neo classical economist}

Neo classical economic thought is more explicit about the role of entrepreneurship to the economic development and can be categorized as

\section*{The Chicago school}

One of the concentrated school of thought is the Chicago school of thought speared headed by Frank knight. The school borrows from the early thinking of an entrepreneur by Cantillon (1975) and J Bsay (1803).It describes the entrepreneur as a risk taker whose motivation is profit maximization .However it does not draw a clear line between entrepreneurship and capitalist

\section*{c) The Austrian school}

The school was speared by Israel kirnzer (1978) .Kirzner thought that the market was already at equilibrium and the entrepreneur role was to intervene to bring them to equilibrium They argued that the entrepreneur needs information to be able to make the correct decision in allocating the resources.According to kirnzer one of the key qualities of the entrepreneur was alertness. Alertness was seen as function of the vision of the market and the entrepreneur had superior knowledge which enabled them to identify feasible opportunities. They gain those superior knowledge through participation into the market and the investment into information. Form this point of view he emphasized the application of arbitraging (buying low and selling high)

\section*{d)The Schumpeterian school}

\section*{Joseph Schumpeter}

He is the early $20^{\text {th }}$ century provided perhaps one of the most comprehensive analysis of entrepreneurship within the context of economic development .He introduced the notion that the entrepreneur is not only the allocate or the director of the resources but combine the input in untried combination (innovator).Schumpeter asserted that the entrepreneur only remained an entrepreneur for has long as he is innovative and losses that characters when the business fall into the routine man agreement of the business

\section*{e) Psychological school of thought}

\section*{McClelland (A function of achievement)}

According to McClelland the characteristic of the entrepreneur has two features .First doing thing in better way and the second making things under uncertainty. He emphasizes achievement orientation as the most important factors for the entrepreneur .Thls includes the following
i) Individuals with high achievement orientations are influenced by the considerations for money and the other external incentives are merely a yardstick for measurement of the success of the entrepreneurs with a high achievement orientation.Achievement orientation can be taught and be increased by deliberate efforts
ii) He observed that the individual with high achievement orientation take calculated risks and they make decisions where there is complete information and they have a tolerance for ambiguity

\section*{f) The social cultural school of thought}

Max Webber theory implied that entrepreneurship was a merely response of the static nature of the dynamic economic conditions but very much a historical sociocultural product In addition to the need for achievement Abraham Maslow and others identified need for the affliction, autonomy and power as the driving force behind behavior and in this case entrepreneurship

\section*{g) The modern day thinkers}

Modern thinkers have defined entrepreneurship in a similar manner .Herbert and link (1980)defined an entrepreneur as a person who specializes in talking responsibility and making of judgment that will affect the location ,the form and the use of the goods ,resources or institutions.Their focus was on the person and what he can do. He takes charge in the creating of change .Kuratko(2016) defined entrepreneur as dynamic process of vision ,change and the creation .It requires the application of energy and the passion towards the creation and the implementation of new ideas and creative solution. Essential ingredients includes the willingness to take calculated risks in terms of time , equity or the career opportunity to formulate effective venture time ,the creative ability to marshal the required resources and the fundamental ability of building a solid business plan and finally the vision to recognize the opportunity where others see chaos, contradictions and confusion

All these definitions of the entrepreneurship highlights some key aspects of an entrepreneur as
i) Value creator
ii) An innovator
iii) An individual with unique psychology and personality
iv) A manager
V) A recipient of rewards for their efforts

Entrepreneurship can be defined as
VI) Multidimensional concept
