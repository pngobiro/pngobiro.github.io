\section*{Chapter 1 : Number Bases}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
* identify the different types of numbers;
* convert between denary and other base;
* convert between binary, octal and hexadecimal;
* understand the column system and number bases;
* understand modular arithmetic;
* hexadecimal, octal addition.

\subsection*{1.1 Introduction}

In this chapter, we start to explore arious sets of numbers which are used to represent data in real life problem. Namely, natural numbers, integers, rational, irrational, real and complex numıers. Numbers are used to represent quantities, measurement, and others in Gir surroundings. They are essential representations of data that will be processed by computer systems to produce useful information. The computer system, ysiing a digital electronic device, has to handle data in binary numbers.

In binary nurieers, each binary digit has only two states rather than ten states in decimal nuiniers. Therefore, binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems are dealt with in subsequent parts of the chapter.

\subsection*{1.1.1 Number Sets}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline $\mathbf{N}$ & Natural Positive integers Example: 3, 71 \\
\hline $\mathbf{Z}$ & Integers Whole numbers Example: 3, -71 \\
\hline $\mathbf{Q}$ & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Rational Real numbers which can be expressed as the ratio \\
of 2 integer Example: 1/2, 0.57, -3
\end{tabular} \\
\hline $\mathbf{F}$ & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Irrational Real numbers which are not rational Example: \\
$\sqrt{2}, \pi$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline $\mathbf{R}$ & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Real Can be represented by points a the straight \\
line Example: $-2.31, \sqrt{5}, 6$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline $\mathbf{C}$ & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Complex No real number that can satisfy the equation X2 \\
$=-1 \quad$ Example: $\sqrt{-1}, \sqrt{-5.75}, \sqrt{-88}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{1.2 Level of Precisions}

Some translator software have two levels of precisions in storing real numbers. Namely single-precision and double precision.

\subsection*{1.2.1 Single Precision}

The real number is calculated to 8 and displayed to 7 significant figures.
Example: $\pi \quad=\quad 3.1415926$ calculated
$=3.141593$ displayed

\subsection*{1.2.2 Double Precision}

The computer will need longer processing time to produce double precision numbers. The real number is calculated to 16 and displayed on the screen to 15 significant figures.

Example: $\pi \quad=\quad 3.141592653589793$ calculated
$=3.14159265358979$ displayed

\subsection*{1.3 Number Base}

A fundamental counting group consists of a number various symbols.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Counting Groups & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Symbols of the Group } & No. of Symbols \\
\hline Binary & 0,1 & 2 \\
\hline Octal & $0,1,2,3,4,5,7$ & 8 \\
\hline Hexadecimal & $0,1,2,3, \cdots, 9, \mathrm{~A}, \mathrm{~B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{F}$ & 16 \\
\hline Denary & $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{1.4 Column Systern}

Enable us th represent any conceivable number by combining numerals and zeros.

For e example, 423524 is derived from this column system:
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Column No } & $\mathbf{6}$ & $\mathbf{5}$ & $\mathbf{4}$ & $\mathbf{3}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ \\
\hline Value & \begin{tabular}{c}
100,00 \\
0
\end{tabular} & 10,000 & 1,000 & 100 & 10 & 1 \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Power of \\
Magnification
\end{tabular} & $10^{5}$ & $10^{4}$ & $10^{3}$ & $10^{2}$ & $10^{1}$ & $10^{0}$ \\
\hline Numerals & 4 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 2 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
$423524=4 \times 10^{5}+2 \times 10^{4}+3 \times 10^{3}+5 \times 10^{2}+2 \times 10^{1}+4 \times 10^{0}$
The Power of Magnification for each individual column is derived as,
Power of Magnification $=$ Base ${ }^{(\text {Column no -1) }}$

\subsection*{1.5 Conversion from Other Bases to Denary}

We can use this column system to convert a number in other bases to its equivalence in Denary.

Example: $\quad$ Convert $111001_{2}$ to denary
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Column No } & $\mathbf{6}$ & $\mathbf{5}$ & $\mathbf{4}$ & $\mathbf{3}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ \\
\hline \hline Value & 32 & 16 & 8 & 4 & 2 & 1 \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Power of \\
Magnification
\end{tabular} & $2^{5}$ & $2^{4}$ & $2^{3}$ & $2^{2}$ & $2^{1}$ & $2^{0}$ \\
\hline Numerals & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
$$\begin{aligned}
111001_{2} & =1 \times 2^{5}+1 \times 2^{4}+1 \times 2^{3}+1 \times 2^{0} \\
& =32+16+8+1 \\
& =57_{10}
\end{aligned}$$

Example: $\quad$ Convert $4 \mathrm{BEEF8}_{16}$ to denary
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Column No } & $\mathbf{6}$ & $\mathbf{4}$ & $\mathbf{3}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $\mathbf{1}$ \\
\hline Value & \begin{tabular}{c}
104857 \\
6
\end{tabular} & 6553 & 4096 & 256 & 16 & 1 \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Power of \\
Magnification
\end{tabular} & $15^{5}$ & $16^{4}$ & $16^{3}$ & $16^{2}$ & $16^{1}$ & $16^{0}$ \\
\hline Numerals & 4 & B & E & E & F & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

4BEEF816 $=415+11 \times 16^{4}+14 \times 16^{3}+14 \times 16^{2}+15 \times 16^{1}+8 \times 16^{0}$
$$=9: 976496_{10}$$

\subsection*{1.6 Conversiun from Denary to Other Bases}

To convert a denary number to other bases, we do a repeated division by the desired base until a quotient 0 is obtained.

Example: $\quad$ Convert $475_{10}$ to octal
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-008.jpg?height=235&width=489&top_left_y=2449&top_left_x=863)

\section*{0 remainder \\ 7}

The octal number is obtained by reading the last integer 7 and upwards to include all remainders; $475_{10}=733_{8}$

Example: Convert $475_{10}$ to binary
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-009.jpg?height=929&width=720&top_left_y=726&top_left_x=922)
$$475_{10}=111011011_{2}$$

\subsection*{1.7 Conversion Among Other Base}

We have illustrated the conversions between denary and other bases. How about converting a binary number to an octal number? Or, an octal number to a hexadecimal one?

\subsection*{1.7.1 Binary to Octal}

We know that $9_{10}=1001_{2}$ and $9_{10}=11_{8}$ so, we can conclude that $1001_{2}=11_{8}$. To convert a binary number to an octal number in this case will involve a lot of calculations.

Is there a better way to convert these numbers?
Yes. How many binary bits do we need to represent an octal digit?
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
Binary & Octal \\
000 & 0
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
001 & 1 \\
010 & 2 \\
011 & 3 \\
100 & 4 \\
101 & 5 \\
110 & 6 \\
111 & 7
\end{tabular}

No. of symbols in octal $=2^{\text {no. of binary bits }}$
We need three binary bits to represent symbols in octal! Likewise, one octal number will produce three binary bits.

To prove it, try whether $374_{8}=011111100_{2}$ ?

\subsection*{1.7.2 Binary to Hexadecimal}

Following the same argument, it is not so difficult to see why we need to have four binary bits to represent one hexadecimal numb

No. of symbols in Hexadecimal $=2^{\text {no. of binary } 011:}$
Now can you see why $110101100_{2}=1$ A $_{16}$ ?

\section*{0001 \\ 1 \\ ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-010.jpg?height=87&width=192&top_left_y=1415&top_left_x=869)}

\subsection*{1.7.3 Conversion Pativen Octal and Hexadecimal}

Since every octal nember will produce three binary bits, and every four binary bits will produre ore hexadecimal number. We can make use of the binary base as the "conversion medium" to convert a hexadecimal number to an octal number or vice verst

Example: $\quad$ Convert $733_{8}$ to a hex no.
Step 1. $\quad$ Convert $733_{8}$ to a binary number.
111011011

Step 2. Rearrange this binary number into 4-bit groups.
000111011011

Step 3. Convert this binary number to a hex.
1 D B
Hence, $733_{8}=1 \mathrm{DB}_{16}$

\subsection*{1.8 Real Number}

In real numbers, e.g. (4.75) ${ }_{10}$, the 4 is an integer part while 0.75 is a fractional part. What is the way to convert 0.75 to a binary fraction? The method is to
multiply 0.75 by 2 continuously until the fraction becomes zero or the degree of accuracy is satisfied.
$4.75=4+0.75=(100)_{2}+(0.11)_{2}=(100.11)_{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-011.jpg?height=335&width=632&top_left_y=476&top_left_x=984)

Let's look at another example.
(6.1) ${ }_{10}$ to be converted to binary places.
$6.1=6+0.1=(110)_{2}+(0.000110)_{2}$
$=(110.000110)_{2}$ correct to 6 binaly places.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-011.jpg?height=192&width=292&top_left_y=1154&top_left_x=984)
$0.1 * 2$
$0.2 * 2$
$0.4 * 2$
0.8 * 2
1.6 * 2
$1.2 * 2$
0.4

On the other rand, how can we convert $(110.000110)_{2}$ to denary real numbers?

\section*{Method:}
i. Write down the value of each bit (binary digit).
ii. Multiply the value by every bit.
iii. Take the sum of products.
$$\left.\begin{array}{lllllllll}
4 & 2 & 1 & 2^{-1} & 2^{-2} & 2^{-3} & 2^{-4} & 2^{-5} & 2^{-6} \\
1 & 1 & 0 & .0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right] \begin{aligned}
& 4^{*} 1+2 * 1+0 * 1+0 * 0.5+0 * 0.25+0 * 0.12 \\
& 0 * 0.015625
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{1.9 Octal Arithmetic}

We only cover octal addition. The sum of two octal numbers can be reduced by the usual addition algorithm to the repeated addition of two digits (with possibly a carry of 1). The following table shows the addition of Octal number.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline ++ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 10 \\
\hline 2 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 10 & 11 \\
\hline 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
\hline 4 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 \\
\hline 5 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 \\
\hline 6 & 6 & 7 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\
\hline 7 & 7 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The sum of two octal digits, or the sum of two octal digits plus 1, can be obtained by:
i. Finding their decimal sum; and
ii. Modifying the decimal, if it exceeds 7, satracting 8 and carrying 1 to the next column.

Example:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-012.jpg?height=449&width=478&top_left_y=1323&top_left_x=680)

\subsection*{1.10 Hexadecimal Arithmetic}

As with the octal system, we cover only hexadecimal addition.

The sum of two hexadecimal digits, or the sum of two hexadecimal digits plus 1 , can be obtained by:
i. Finding their decimal sum; and
ii. Modifying the decimal, if it exceeds 15 , by subtracting 16 and carrying 1 to the next column.

If the base exceeds ten, we need mentally to change each hexadecimal letter digit to its decimal form when finding the decimal sum, and each decimal difference greater than nine to its hexadecimal form when modifying the decimal sum.
1. $A=10 \quad B=11 \quad C=12 \quad D=13 \quad E=14 \quad F=15$

Example:
$$\mathrm{A}_{16}+9_{16}$$
\begin{tabular}{lc} 
& \begin{tabular}{c}
$\mathrm{A}_{16}$ \\
+ \\
$9_{16}$
\end{tabular} \\
& \\
Decimal sum \\
Modification & - \\
Octal sum & $\frac{19}{16}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{1.11 Modular Arithmetic}

In our daily life, there are many counting/measuring systems around us. We know that 100 cm is not the same as 100 inches. It's because the measuring units are different, however, we do not intend to cover the conversions of this kind.

To demonstrate how modular arithmetic works is to give a test first:
"If Peter starts work at 8 o'clock in the morning and works for 8 hours, at what time will Peter finish work?"

4 o'clock in the afternoon, right? But how you worket trat one out? Because the clock only has 12 hours, once the shorthand reache, 12 , it will restart from 0 . The numbers we see on the clock-face must be less than or equal to 12 . This is a finite set or finite arithmetics.

To show it mathematically, we add 8 hours to 8 o'clock, and divide 16 by the modules number 12, the remainder $h_{1}^{11}$ be the answer we want.
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$8+8$ & 16 \\
$(16)_{\bmod 12}$ & - & 4
\end{tabular}

\section*{Example:}
$(11+3+7+9)_{\bmod 12}$
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$30 / 12$ & $=$ & 2 remainder 6 \\
$30 \bmod _{12}$ & $=$ & 6
\end{tabular}

\section*{Points to Remember}

The various sets of numbers include:
- Natural numbers
- Integers
- Rational numbers
- Irrational numbers
- Real numbers
- Complex numbers

The higher the precision required the longer the processing time in computer systems.

\section*{4 number systems}

\subsection*{2.1 Binary Addition}

Binary addition for fixed point numbers is done as follows:
The numbers to be added are aligned by their binary points.
Starting from the least significant (rightmost) digit, a corresponding pair of digits (in the same column) are added according to the rules of binary addition.
If a column has a carry from the previous column, the carry digit has to be added also.

Repeat steps (ii) and (iii) for each column until the most significant (leftmost) digit has been added.

\subsection*{2.1.1 Rules for Binary Addition}
```
1+1 = 0 < and carry over 1 to add to next column
1+0 = 1 (i.e. 1+1 = 10)
0+1=1
0+0=0
```

\subsection*{2.5 Number Storage in the Computer Wor}

Computer storage is arranged in words. A word is defined as a unit of data for the machine. Words vary in length on different types of machines. Common word sizes are $8,12,16,24$ and 32 bits.
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline Bit & \begin{tabular}{l} 
A 'bit', shorl for binary digit, is in fact the smallest unit of \\
informati $n$ stored in a circuit element such as a 'gate' or \\
moved hiough the circuitry as a 'pulse' or 'no-pulse'. By \\
itself 'it is of course limited in its capacity to carry \\
iniormation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Byte & \begin{tabular}{l} 
8-bit string of binary bits is known as a byte. It is \\
widely used because it corresponds to one character.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Word & \begin{tabular}{l} 
A word is usually a multiple number of bytes. It is \\
machine dependent and it is the unit of data for the \\
machine. e.g. 8-bits, 16-bits, 32-bits, etc.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Character & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Characters may be represented by binary codes e.g. ASCII \\
code. Since character codes are normally no more than 8 \\
bits in length, there is a tendency to substitute "byte" for \\
"character" and "character" for "byte" rather \\
indiscriminately when describing storage capacities.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{2.5.1 16 Bit Microcomputers}

Most of the popular microcomputer based systems used in schools and colleges are "16-bit micros". In these "machines" each word in memory is 2 bytes in length (i.e. 8 -bits). Each word is sufficiently large to hold the binary code for one character but program instructions are normally too long to fit into a single word and are therefore spread over two or three words in sequence.

\subsection*{2.5.2 32 Bit Machines}

Some of the more modern microcomputers are " 32 -bit micros". Many minicomputers are also " 32 -bit machines". Each word is four bytes (32-bits) in length, i.e. the "word length" is 32 -bits.

\subsection*{2.5.3 Size Limits of Data}

Computer storage is of finite size. This limits the size of numbers which can be stored and their accuracy.

Example: 16 bit words are common and hold numbers from -32768 to 32767.

\subsection*{2.6 Storage of Numbers}

It is important to know the format of storage before interpreting the given 0 's and 1 's stored in a computer word. There are many formats of storing numbers:

Integer (using sign modulus format)
Integer (using 2's complement format)
Fraction
Mixed number
Floating point number

\subsection*{2.6.1 Storage of Integers Using Sign Modulas Method}

Types of numbers
- Even if you krow that the data is numeric, make sure you have the right format
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-025.jpg?height=152&width=363&top_left_y=1688&top_left_x=635)
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$(3)$ & $=$ & 13760
\end{tabular}$\quad$\begin{tabular}{l} 
decimal integer \\
(1) $=$ \\
(2)
\end{tabular}
and there are many other formats

\subsection*{2.6.2 Storage of Integers}

735 decimal $=1011011111$ (10 bits)
Add 2 bits "padding" in a 12 bit word
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

By convention, the first (left-hand) bit is the sign bit

Therefore only 11 bits are left for the number value
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-026.jpg?height=341&width=1211&top_left_y=366&top_left_x=568)

Small numbers stored in 12-bit words are mostly "padding" bits
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-026.jpg?height=246&width=1209&top_left_y=839&top_left_x=566)

Padding is not really wasteful, it is necessary to mak: the calculation methods work properly

The upper limit for storing a number in a $12 \cdot$ bit word is $011111111111=2047$ decimal

The range of a given computer $n$ bit whar for sign modulus is $-\left(2^{n-1}\right)$ to $\left(2^{n-1}-1\right)$ Larger numbers need double lengd
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-026.jpg?height=398&width=1231&top_left_y=1451&top_left_x=555)

22 bits can hold $4194303_{10}$

\subsection*{2.7 Storage of Fractions}

This representation is exact.
If 11 bits is not enough for exact representation:
- Truncate
- Round off
- Extend to double length (or more)

Usual convention is one word for integral part, the other for fraction

\subsection*{2.9 Storage of Number Using 2's Complement Method}

Sign-modulus method is unsuitable for calculation. Computers usually use 2 's complement method to store numbers and calculation.

In 2's complement method, no sign bit is reserved to indicate the sign of number.
However, if the leftmost bit is 0 , it indicates a positive number. If the leftmost is a 1 , then it is an implied negative number.

Stored numbers in 2's complement method can be defined in 4 stages.
Steps:
Convert absolute value of given no. into binary.
Store binary no. into given computer word.
Check if given no is positive, the steps are completed.
If given no is negative then
4.1 Invert all bits
$0 \quad \rightarrow \quad 1$
$1 \rightarrow 0$
4.2 Add 1 to the inverted no.

Example: $\quad$ Store 45 and -45 into 8 bit register
To store 45:
Steps:
1. 45 in binary : 101101
2. 45 in 8 bit: 00101101
3. Since no. (45) is positio. task is completed.

To store -45:
Steps:
4. 45 in bunary :

101101
5. 45 in 8 bits:

00101101
6. -45:

11010010
\begin{tabular}{l}
$+\quad 1$ \\
\hline 11010011
\end{tabular}
The range of number that can be stored in n-bit comp word in 2 's complement format is
$$-\left(2^{\mathrm{n}-1}\right) \text { to }\left(2^{\mathrm{n}-1}-1\right)$$

Example: in 8 bit word, the range is
$$-\left(2^{8-1}\right) \text { to }\left(2^{8-1}-1\right)=-128 \text { to } 127$$

\subsection*{2.10 Ten's Complement}
$8^{\prime}=2$ because $8+2=10$ as such
$$\begin{aligned}
& 8-2=(8+8)-10=6 \\
& 6-4=(6+6)-10=2
\end{aligned}$$

These findings have a significant impact on the arithmatics operation in computer.

\subsection*{2.11 Two's Complement}

Computers can only do addition, so subtraction is done by adding the complement of the subtrahend to the minuend.
(Using four bits to store the binary number)

\section*{Example:}
```
5 \text { convert to binary 0101}
3 convert to binary 0011
2 1100 }->\mathrm{ step 1 invert the pits of 0011
- + 1 step 2 add 1 to,he least significant bit of 1100
    1101 -> step 3 add the 2's complement of 0011 to 0101
        carry 1 +
ignored
```

\subsection*{2.12 Recomplementing Cases}

If the minuend is lasear the subtrahend then it is necessary to recomplement the answer and adda minus sign to it.

Example:
3 convert to binary 0011
-5 convert to binary 0101
$\underline{-2} \quad 1010 \rightarrow$ step 1 invert the bit of 0101
$+1 \rightarrow$ step 2 add 1 to the least significant bit of 1010
$\overline{1011} \rightarrow$ step 3 add the 2's complement of 0101 to 0011
0011
$\overline{\frac{1110}{0001}} \rightarrow \begin{aligned} & \text { step } 4 \text { recomplement } 1110 \text { and add a minus } \\ & \text { sign to the answer }\end{aligned}$
$\frac{+\quad 1}{\underline{-0010}} \rightarrow$ convert to denary is -2

\subsection*{2.13 Shift Operations}

Shifting refers to a process whereby it is possible to physically move the pattern of bits within a computer word to the left or to the right. A number of different
types of shift operations do exist. The most common are circular, logical and arithmetic shifts. We will only be interested in the arithmetic shift operation.

\subsection*{2.13.1 Shift Operations to Achieve Multiplication}

If every bit in a 12-bit word is moved one place to the left it immediately has an associated place-value which is twice that previously associated with it and so the effect of shifting one place to the left is to double the value of the quantity originally stored. If shifted two places to the left, this doubling is repeated, so that the result is now four times the original; three place shifted to the left has the effect of multiplying the quantity by eight (since $8=23$ ) and so on.

Under these circumstances the gaps which occur at the right hand end of the word as the shifting takes place are filled with zeros and anything shifted beyond the left-hand end is lost. Additionally, this process is only valid so long as the signbit remains as zero, (although techniques do exist to cope with negative quantities). But if a positive number is to be multiplied in this way and there is possible to avoid the difficulty by going into double-length.

\section*{Example:}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-030.jpg?height=932&width=1283&top_left_y=1198&top_left_x=489)

\subsection*{2.13.2 Shift Operations to Achieve Division}

Just as shifting to the left effects multiplication by the relevant power of two, so shifting to the right achieves division by the relevant power of two. In this case the gaps caused by shifting occur at the left-hand end of the word and are replaced by copies of the sign-bit to retain arithmetic significance: it is in fact more straightforward to cope with negative values here than in the case of multiplication. Any bit shifted beyond the right-hand end of the word is lost and the result is a truncated form of division.

If the last bit to be shifted beyond the right-hand end of the word were to be then added back on to the right-hand end bit the result would be a rounded form of the same division.

\section*{Chapter 3 : Floating Point Representation}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt how to:
* perform floating point arithmetic;
* perform number storage.

\subsection*{3.1 Introduction}

When working with a single-length 12 -bit word size we can cope with integral values in the range of -2048 to +2047 . Similar limitations are imposed upon mixed or fractional values. However, we do have the option of extending these ranges by the use of double-length words but this is not always convenient.

A better alternative to fixed-point representation is the floating-point representation. It is capable of holding, in a silizite-length word, a greater range of numbers. It also uses the same form for cuping with integer mixed numbers or fractions but at a cost of reduced accurasy.

Generally, the floating-point form s suitable for handling quantities of far higher values than usual, or whose values are every small.

\subsection*{3.2 Fixed Point and Fwating Point Binary}

For fixed point biraty the binary places are fixed.
0000.0000 (4 bits is reserved for integer part and the other 4 bits is reserved for fraction part)

Using such representation the numbers that can be represented are limited.
Example, if 01110.11 is to be stored using the above format only 1110.1100 could be reflected (note that most significant bit is a sign bit). To be more precise in representing number the floating-point format is used.

Using Floating Point, 01110.11 could be represented as follow:
$01110.11=0.1110110 \times 2^{100} \quad$ (Using 8 bits to store number. The power is 100 or 4 in denary as four decimal places are shifted)

Floating Point numbers are made up of three parts
- Mantissa (e.g. 0.11101102)
- Base (Radix) (e.g. 2)
- Exponent (Power) (e.g. $100_{2}$ )

\subsection*{3.3 Floating Point Storage}
$$\mathrm{m} \mathrm{x} \mathrm{~B}^{\mathrm{E}} \text { where }$$

Mantissa can be in
- Sign modulus
- 2's complement

Exponent can be in
- 2 's complements
- Excess $2^{\mathrm{n}-1}$ where n is the no. of storage bits for exponent

\subsection*{3.4 Floating Point Storage}

Storing numbers in normalised floating point form be defined with the following steps.

\section*{Steps:}

Convert given numbers into binary
Check if converted is normalised, if not nornelised it.
Store mantissa based on given format.
(which can be sign modulus or 2's compiement.)
Store exponent based on given format.
(which can be 2 's complements $(1)$ excess $2 \mathrm{n}-1$ method.)

\subsection*{3.4.1 Store Reating Point Format}

\section*{Format A}

Sign modulus mantissa and 2's complement exponent.
- Floating point numbers are stored using 16 bits. The first bit is the mantissa sign bit, next 9 are the normalised mantissa and the final six bits are the exponents in 2 's complement.

\section*{Format B}

2's complement's mantissa and 2's complement exponent.
- Floating point numbers are stored using 16 bits. The first ten bits 2 's complement mantissa followed by a six-bit 2's complement exponent.

\section*{Format C}

Sign modulus mantissa and excess $2^{n-1}$ method.
- The first bit is the mantissa sign bit, the next 9 bits are normalised mantissa, the final six bits the exponent in excess $2 \mathrm{n}-1$ form.

\section*{Format D}

2's complement's mantissa and excess $2 \mathrm{n}-1$ method.
- Given 16 bits storage. First 10 bits 2's complement mantissa followed by 6 bits exponent in excess $2^{\mathrm{n}-1}$ form.
Note: i. For mantissa stored using sign modulus form, 1 bit will be reserved to represent the sign, the absolute value of mantissa is stored without including the first bit before the decimal point.
ii. For mantissa stored using the 2's complement method, the first bit before the decimal point will be stored as it indicates the sign of the mantissa.

\subsection*{3.5 Floating Point Notation}

Scientific notation (decimal).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-036.jpg?height=153&width=549&top_left_y=1031&top_left_x=733)

Mantissa always 1 or greater, but less than 10
$$1 \leq|\mathrm{M}|<10$$

Exponent always integer.

Note: Mantissa can also be ne ${ }^{\text {radive. }}$

\subsection*{3.6 Normalised Floating Point Form (Decimal)}

Divide mantissab 10 , increase exponent by 1.
Mantissa no w llways fraction, 0.1 or bigger.
$$0.1<|\mathrm{M}|<1$$

Example: $\quad 0.93 \times 10^{8}, 0.9 \times 10^{-28}$
Normalisation gets rid of mixed numbers.
- Better for computers.

\subsection*{3.7 Normalised Exponent Form (Binary)}

Same principles as decimal.
Mantissa always fraction 0.1 (binary) or bigger.
$$0.1 \leq|\mathrm{M}|<1$$

Exponent is positive or negative integer.

Note: Mantissa needs a sign bit but doesn't use two's complement.

\subsection*{3.8 Storing Negative Mantissa}

The mantissa can either be positive or negative. There are two alternative conventions used for storing the mantissa:

Sign Bit
- ' 0 ' is assigned if the mantissa is positive;
- ' 1 ' is assigned if the mantissa is negative.

Two's Complement Method.
- The two's complement of the mantissa is used if it is negative.

\subsection*{3.9 Storing Negative Exponent}

Two alternative conventions also exist with respect to the storage of the exponent:

Two's complement form.
- The exponent is stored in its two's complement form if it is negative and so we do not need to allocate aseparate space to hold the sign of the exponent. Although we must always do so for that of the mantissa.

Excess $2^{n-1}$ code of form.
(where $\mathbf{n}$ is the number of hits assigned for the exponent)
- In this method, the value of $2^{\mathrm{n}-1}$ is added to the actual exponent whether positive or negatice to give the stored exponent.

Oiored Exponent $=$ True Exponent $+2^{\text {n-1 }}$
OR
True Exponent $=$ Store Exponent $-2^{n-1}$

\title{
Chapter 4 : Set Notation Representation And Probability
}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you should understand:
* the logical requirements of a set;
* how to enumerate and specify sets;
* the use of Venn diagrams;
* problem solving;
* relations between sets;
* that in real life problems, we have to cost with likelihood and not $100 \%$ certainty. Probability model allows us o evaluate the chances or likelihood;
* probability and know the valid range of values of a probability;
* Venn Diagram as probability spaced;
* and find probability $I$ cumbined events;
* and use tree diagmems to depict all possible outcomes in a program, it helps in determiniris, tre probability of relevant event.

\subsection*{4.1 Introduction}

Many real life problems can be analysed further as some collection of objects, each collection of objects may have logical relationship with another. This chapter will tell us how sets and Venn diagrams can be used to real life problems.

\subsection*{4.2 Definition of Set}

A set is a collection of objects, things or symbols, for instance, numbers, names of people, colours etc.

The individual objects in a set are called elements or members of the set. All the members of the set have a common feature, which links them in some way.

The elements in a set must be unique.

\subsection*{4.3 Notation}

To identify specific sets, we may either give tham names, or just using capital letters.

For example:
$$\begin{aligned}
& A=\{2,4,6,8,10\} \text { or }\{x: x \text { is ev en integer and } 1 \leq x \leq 10\} \\
& B=\{1,3,5,7,9\} \text { or }\{x: x \text { is cad integer and } 1 \leq x \leq 10\} \\
& C=\{\text { CAT, DOG, HOHSE, LION, RABBIT, TIGER }\} \\
& D=\{\text { BLACK, DIUE, GREEN, ORANGE, PINK, RED, YELLOW }\} \\
& E=\{x: x \text { is }
\end{aligned}$$

Take set E as on example, we know that July is a member of E, while Tuesday is not a member of E. We therefore abbreviate the phrase "is a member of" by using the Greek letter epsilon, $\in$, and $\notin$, to denote "is not a member of".

As for the above examples, we may write $\mathrm{CAT} \in \mathrm{C}$, July $\in \mathrm{E}$, but Tuesday $\notin \mathrm{E}$.

\subsection*{4.4 Venn Diagrams}

We have learn two methods of expressing a set:
By listing the elements within brackets, $\}$.
By specifying the main characteristics of the set.

Beside these two ways, we can also use diagram, Venn Diagram. Usually a rectangle is used to denote the universal set U .

For example, $U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}, A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{4,5\}$ then the Venn Diagram is

U

Figure 6-1

\subsection*{4.5 Relation Between Sets}

\subsection*{4.5.1 Universal Set}

For all problems, there exists a fixf $\mathrm{s} t$ which called the Universal Set. This is the largest set which contains all ne rated items.

The Universal Set is denoted by $\cup$ or $\xi$.

\subsection*{4.5.2 The Null or Eorpty Set}

The sets that wo drocussed above contain at least one element. There are some sets that do not sontain any element at all. We call them the null or empty set.

The Empty Set is denoted by $\varnothing$ or a pair of empty brackets $\}$.
Examples of null set are:
The set of pupils in your class who are less than 12 years old.
The set of months with 12 days.
The set of cats in Singapore with four tails.
The set of cars with 68 doors.

\subsection*{4.5.3 The Finite and Infinite Set}

Question: How many elements are there in the set of English Letters?
Answer: 26 letters i.e. a..z
If we let E be the set of all English Letters, then the number of element in this set E is 26 , and we write as $\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{E})=26$.

In most of the cases, we are able to tell the number of elements in a set, but however, there might have cases which we cannot give an exact figure. For example, the set of even number, the set of prime number that are more than 10 etc.

Definition: A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set.

A set which has infinite number of elements is called an infinite set.

\subsection*{4.5.4 Subset}

A set P is a subset of a set Q if every eleme ats of P is also element of Q , we write $\mathrm{P} \subseteq \mathrm{Q}$.

\section*{Example:}
$$\begin{aligned}
& U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,89,10,11,12\} \\
& A=\{2,4,6,8,18\} \\
& B=\{1,2,3,4,55,7,8,9,10\}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{So, $A \subseteq B \subseteq D$}

\section*{U}

Figure 6-2

\section*{Facts}
- $\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{B} \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{A} \subset \mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{A} \supset \mathrm{B}$
- The empty set is a subset of every set.

\subsection*{4.5.5 Complement}

The complement of the set A is the set of elements which are not in A, denoted by $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-047.jpg?height=478&width=680&top_left_y=503&top_left_x=782)

Figure 6-3

\section*{Examples:}

If $U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$, and $A=\{1,3,5,7\}$
then $\mathbf{A}=\{2,4,6,8,9,10\}$
If $U$ is the set of real numbers, and $A$ is the set of all negative real numbers then $A$ is the set of all positive real numbers.

\section*{Facts}
- The complement of the universal set is the empty set.
- The complenent ef the empty set is the universal set.
- The comprment of $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$ is A
i. $A=(A)=A$

\subsection*{4.5.6 Union}

The union of two sets, A and B, is the set of all elements of A and/or B we write. i.e. $A \cup B=\{x: x \in A$ and $/$ or $x \in B\}$

\subsection*{4.6 Properties}

Commutative Property
$$\begin{aligned}
& A \cap B=B \cap A \\
& A \cup B=B \cup A
\end{aligned}$$

Associative Property
$$\begin{aligned}
& (A \cap B) \cap C=A \cap(B \cap C) \\
& (A \cup B) \cup C=A \cup(B \cup C)
\end{aligned}$$

Distribution Property
$$\begin{aligned}
& A \cap(B \cup C)=(A \cap B) \cup(A \cap C) \\
& A \cup(B \cap C)=(A \cup B) \cap(A \cup C)
\end{aligned}$$

Example: If $A=\{1,3,5,7\}, B=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $C=\{3,4,7\}$ then
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { i. } \quad A \cap(B \cup C) & =\{1,3,5,7\} \cap\{1,2,3,4,7\} \\
& =\{1,3,7\} \\
\text { ii. } \quad(A \cap B) \cup(A \cap C) & =\{1,3\} \cup\{3,7\} \\
& =\{1,3,7\}
\end{array}$$

Prove the second distribution property law.

\subsection*{4.7 Applications}

Use of Venn diagrams in Solving Problems

\section*{Example:}

In a group of 40 boys, 27 like to play basketball, 25 like tennis while 17 like both. Deduce the number of boys who play neither game.

\section*{Solution:}

Let B represent the set of boys who play basketball and T represents those playing tennis. We are told that 17 like both, that means $n(B \cap T)=17$.

Let the number of boys who play neither game be x .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-051.jpg?height=460&width=692&top_left_y=969&top_left_x=773)

Tigure 6-10
We are given $\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{U})$
therefore, 40
40
$10+17+8+x$
$35+x$
$x=40-35$
$=5$

\subsection*{4.8 Other Logical Relation}

Venn diagrams in set theory can also be used to describe logical relationship. Namely AND, OR, XOR and NAND, they can be illustrated clearly on the diagram.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-052.jpg?height=817&width=1206&top_left_y=568&top_left_x=519)

\section*{Figure 6-11}

In programming, logical $e x_{1} r$ ressions are often in selection statements and repetition statements.

\section*{Example:}

If Age > 21 AND height >= 1.70
Age $>21$, this condition will satisfy a set and height $>=1.70$ will form another set:

The operator AND, has produced a region that is the common region of both sets, as shown in Fig 6.11a.

\section*{Points to Remember}

A set is defined as a collection of items which share a common feature and all items are unique.
Use Venn diagram to represent various sets. It is a good model to solve some real life problem.
Relationship between sets
\begin{tabular}{lcll} 
Subset & $\subset$ & & \\

\section*{Probability}

\section*{Introduction}

Probability theory is the sclence of evaluating uncertainty. It provides the means by which a certain amount of order and predictability may be derived from the natural state of un\&itainty.

We can forecast the likelihood of an occurrence by applying probability model on statistical data collected.

\subsection*{4.10 Definition of Probability}

We can measure probability by considering how often an event occurs in relation to how often it could occur. It is normally given in terms of a ratio. An event is simply an occurrence.
$$\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{E})=\frac{\text { No. of outcomes that satisfy event } \mathrm{E}}{\text { No. of total possible outcomes }}$$

Example: Tossing a coin, throwing a dice.
If a coin, when tossed, has one chance in two of turning up a head, we say that the probability of getting a head is $1 / 2$. When many coins are tossed, it is likely that about one half of them will turn up heads. In symbols, we write this as:
$$\mathrm{P}(\text { Head })=\frac{1}{2}$$

If a dice, when tossed, has one chance in six of turning up with the face containing six dots, we say that the probability for the face with six dots to turn up is $1 / 6$. In symbols, we write this as:
$$P(6)=\frac{1}{6}$$

In arranging three letters A, D, P in a row, what is the probability that they will appear as PAD. What is the probability that they will appear either as PAD or DAP?
The letter A, D, P can be arranged as follows:

> PAD, PDA, DAP, DPA, ADP, APD

Thus, the letters may be arranged in six different ways.
Only one of them is PAD. Hence, the probablit of the letters appearing as PAD is $\frac{1}{6}$. In symbols, we write this as:
$$\mathrm{P}\left(\mathrm{PAE}=\frac{1}{6}\right.$$

The arrangement PAD and DAP are two of the total six arrangements. Thus, the probability of the letters appearing either as PAD or DAP is $2 / 6$ i.e. $1 / 3$. In symbols, we write tris as:
$$\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{PAD} \text { or } \mathrm{DAP})=\frac{1}{3}$$

Note: $\quad$ Probability can never be less than 0 or greater than 1 .

\subsection*{4.10.1 Success and Failure}

In probability theory, if an event occurs, we say we have a success. The probability of a success is defined as:
$$\mathrm{p}=\frac{\text { No. of successes }}{\text { No. of possible occurences }}$$

If the event we are concerned with does not occur, we have therefore a failure. The probability of a failure is symbolised as q.
$$\mathrm{p}=\frac{\text { No. of failures }}{\text { No. of possibleoccurences }}$$

Since we have either failure or success for an event, and the total probability is 1 , therefore
$$\mathrm{p}+\mathrm{q}=1$$

\section*{Example:}
10. What is the probability of turning up a number greater than 2 with one throw of a dice?
11. What is the probability of turning up a number greater than 0 ?

\section*{Solution:}
12. The number greater than 2 which are on the faces of the dice are $3,4,5$ and 6. Thus 4 successful events are possible i.e. $s=4$.

There are 2 possible unsuccessful events, therefore $\mathrm{f}=2$
(i.e. turning up the number 1 and 2).

Hence $P$ (number greater than 2 ) $=\frac{s}{f+8}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{4}{2+4} \\
& =\frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}$$

The numbers $1,2,3,4,5$ and 6 are all geater than 0 . Hence there are no unsuccessful events i.e. $\mathrm{f}=0$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Therefore } \mathrm{P}(\text { number rreater } 0) & =\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{f}+\mathrm{s}} \\
& =\frac{6}{6} \\
& =1
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example:}

What is the probability of drawing a clubs from a pack of 52 cards?
(There are 13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 diamonds and 13 spades in a pack.

\section*{Solution:}
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{s}=13 \\
& \mathrm{f}=13+13+13 \\
& \mathrm{n}=\mathrm{f}+\mathrm{s}=13+13+13+13=52
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore P(a club) $=\frac{13}{52}$
$$=\quad \frac{1}{4}$$
where s represents the number of ways a successful event can occur.
f represents the number of ways an unsuccessful event can occur.
n represents the number of all possible ways an even can occur.
The following list gives example of some common probability:
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Events } & Probability \\
\hline Certainty of death & $\mathrm{p}=1$ \\
Sun rising tomorrow & $\mathrm{p}=1$ \\
The card you pick is not a heart & $\mathrm{p}=\frac{3}{4}$ \\
Getting heads in tossing a coin & $\mathrm{p}=\frac{1}{2}$ \\
Newly born baby being a boy (girl) & $\mathrm{p}=\frac{1}{2}$ \\
A man living 300 years & $\mathrm{p}=0$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{4.11 Probability Spaces}

Use Venn diagram to depict all possible 1 itcenes in a problem. The number of elements in each set or subset are clearly visible, when the number of elements of the Universal set is known, probability $\begin{aligned} & \text { f an event may be obtained. }\end{aligned}$

\section*{Example:}

\subsection*{4.12 Probability of Combined Events}

\subsection*{4.12.1 Addition Law}

If the probability of n mutually exclusive events happening are $\mathrm{P}_{1}, \mathrm{P}_{2}, \mathrm{P}_{3} \ldots \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{n}}$ then the probability that one of these events will occur is:
$$\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}_{2}+\mathrm{P}_{3}+\ldots+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{n}}$$

Events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive i.e. $(P(A$ and $B)=0)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-062.jpg?height=380&width=674&top_left_y=772&top_left_x=739)

\subsection*{4.12.2 General Addition Law}

If $A$ and $B$ are two events then
$\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}$ or B$)=\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A})+\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B})-\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}$ and B$)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-062.jpg?height=423&width=666&top_left_y=1444&top_left_x=729)
$\varepsilon$

If $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}$ and B$)=0$
$\rightarrow \mathrm{A}$ and B are mutually exclusive events.
Example: What is the probability of getting a 2 or a 3 with one throw of an ordinary dice?

Solution:
Probability of getting a $2=\frac{1}{6}$
Probability of getting a $3=\frac{1}{6}$
Therefore probability of getting a 2 or a $3=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$
Example: What is the probability of getting a number not more than 5 with one throw of a dice?
Solution: \begin{tabular}{rll} 
Probability of getting a 1 & $=$ & $\frac{1}{6}$ \\
Probability of getting a 2 & $=$ & $\frac{1}{6}$ \\
Probability of getting a 3 & $=\frac{1}{6}$ \\
Probability of getting a 4 & $=\frac{1}{6}$ \\
Probability of getting a 5 & $=\frac{1}{6}$
\end{tabular}

Therefore the probability of getting a number not more than 5 with one throw $=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$

Alternatively, the probability of getting a number more than 5 (i.e. a 6 ) is $\frac{1}{6}$

Therefore the probability of getting a number not more than 5
$$=1-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$$

Example: A card is drawn 1 ror a shuffled pack of 52 cards. What is the probability of (Irawing a king or a heart?

\section*{Solution:}

$\varepsilon$
$\mathrm{P}($ king or heart)
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\quad \mathrm{P}(\text { king })+\mathrm{P}(\text { heart })-\mathrm{P}(\text { king and heart }) \\
& =\quad \frac{4}{25}+\frac{13}{52}-\frac{1}{52}=\frac{4}{13}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{4.12.3 Multiplication Law}

If the probability of $n$ independent events are $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \ldots P_{n}$ then the probability that ALL the events will occur is:
$$\mathrm{P}_{1} \times \mathrm{P}_{2} \times \mathrm{P}_{3} \times \ldots \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{n}}$$

Example: What is the probability of getting four heads in four tosses of a coin?
\begin{tabular}{llll} 
Solution: & Probability of head on 1st throw & $=$ & $\frac{1}{2}$ \\
& Probability of head on 2nd throw & $=$ & $\frac{1}{2}$ \\
& Probability of head on 3rd throw $=$ & $\frac{1}{2}$ & \\
& & $\frac{1}{2}$
\end{tabular}

Therefore probability of getting four heads in four tosses
$=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{16}$
In general, $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}$ and B$)=\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}) * \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B} \backslash \mathrm{A})$
where $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B} \backslash \mathrm{A})$ means probability of B given that A has occurred.

If $A$ and $B$ are independent then $P(B \backslash A)=P(B)$ (regardless of $A$ ) i.e. $\quad \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}$ and B$)=\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{A}) \times \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B})$

Example: What is the probability of onaing 5 's with two throws of a dice?

Solution: $\quad$ Probability of a 5 on se throw $=\frac{1}{6}$
Probability.sfia 5 on 2nd throw $=\quad \frac{1}{6}$
Therefore probability of throwing two 5 's $=\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$

\subsection*{4.12.4 Prohatility of Events that Occur Together}

Example: What is the probability of getting a sum of 7 with a toss of two dice?

Solution: Sample space:
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
$(1,6)$ & $(2,6)$ & $(3,6)$ & $(4,6)$ & $(5,6)$ & $(6,6)$ \\
$(1,5)$ & $(2,5)$ & $(3,5)$ & $(4,5)$ & $(5,5)$ & $(6,5)$ \\
$(1,4)$ & $(2,4)$ & $(3,4)$ & $(4,4)$ & $(5,4)$ & $(6,4)$ \\
$(1,3)$ & $(2,3)$ & $(3,3)$ & $(4,3)$ & $(5,3)$ & $(6,3)$ \\
$(1,2)$ & $(2,2)$ & $(3,2)$ & $(4,2)$ & $(5,2)$ & $(6,2)$ \\
$(1,1)$ & $(2,1)$ & $(3,1)$ & $(4,1)$ & $(5,1)$ & $(6,1)$
\end{tabular}

There are altogether 36 sample points.

The set of sample points which give a total of 7 is:
$\mathrm{E}=\{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)\}$
Therefore the required probability $=\frac{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{E})}{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{S})}=\frac{1}{36}$ or $\frac{1}{6}$

Example: $\quad$ Suppose we toss a coin and then a dice. What is the sample space for this experiment? What is the probability of tossing a ( $\mathrm{H}, 6$ )?

Solution: If $S$ represent the sample then
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{S}= & \begin{array}{l}
\{(\mathrm{H}, 1),(\mathrm{H}, 2),(\mathrm{H}, 3),(\mathrm{H}, 4),(\mathrm{H}, 5),(\mathrm{H}, 6),(\mathrm{T}, 1), \\
(\mathrm{T}, 2),(\mathrm{T}, 3),(\mathrm{T}, 4),(\mathrm{T}, 5),(\mathrm{T}, 6)\}
\end{array}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore $\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{S})=12$
There is only one sample point with $(H, 6)$ in the sample space.
Therefore $\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{E})=1$
Therefore $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{E})=\frac{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{E})}{\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{S})}=\frac{13}{12}$
where S (sample space) represents all possible events,
E rements the required event.

\subsection*{4.13 Tree Diagrams}

A (rooted) tree diagram augments the fundamental principle of counting by exhibiting all possible outcomes of a sequence of events where each event can occur in a finite number of ways.

\section*{Example:}

Marc and Erik are to play a tennis tournament. The first person to win two games in a row or to win a total of three games wins the tournament.

The figure below gives a tree diagram which shows how the tournament can be. The tree is constructed from left to right. At each point (a game) other than an endpoint, there originate two branches which correspond to the two possible outcomes of that game, i.e. Marx (M) winning or Erik (E) winning. Observe that there are 10 end-points corresponding to the 10 possible courses of the tournament:

MM, MEMM, MEMEM, MEMEE, MEE, EMM, FMEMM, EMEME, EMEE and EE

The path from the beginning of the tree to a narticular endpoint describes who won which game in that particular course.

\section*{Example:}

If the probability that you will use a particular spreadsheet system is $3 / 4$ and the probability that the software loads correctly is 0.9 , there are 4 possible results when you try to use that spreadsheet. Draw the appropriate probability tree to illustrate this situation and calculate the probability of each of the 4 possible outcomes.

\section*{Solution:}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-067.jpg?height=395&width=952&top_left_y=362&top_left_x=643)
$$\mathrm{P}\left(\text { use spreadsheet, load correctly) }=\frac{3}{4} \times 0.9=0.675\right.$$
$$\mathrm{P} \text { (use spreadsheet, load wrongly) }=\frac{3}{4} \times 0.1=0.075$$
$$\mathrm{P} \text { (use others, load correctly) } \quad=\frac{1}{4} \times 9.9=0.225$$
$$\mathrm{P} \text { (use others, load correctly) } \quad=\frac{1}{-} \times 0.1=0.025$$

Example: Produce a probability tree to show the eight outcomes of the experiment includirg the three events that:

The company catc base needs updating with a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$.
The dafalase manager is in a meeting with a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$.
The database maintainer is on holiday with a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$.
(Hint: Check that the probabilities of these eight outcomes as shown on the tree do indeed total 1).

\section*{Points to Remember}

Definition of probability
Probability of an event E
$$P(E)=\frac{\text { No.of outcomes that satisfy event } E}{\text { No.of total possible outcomes }}$$

Range of Probability
$0 \leq \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{E}) \leq 1$
When $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{E})=0$, it means that event E is not possible.
When $P(E)=1$, it means that event $E$ is certain.
The occurrence of an event can be treated as success, otherwise a failure.
- $\mathrm{P}($ Success $)+\mathrm{P}($ Failure $)=1$

Venn diagram from set theory, histogram or ciilulative frequency diagram from a statistical frequency distribution; innial distribution, they can form probability spaces on which probabinty or relevant events can be evaluated.
Two cases of combined events
- Probability of one of the nutually exclusive events will occur
$$=\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}_{2}+\mathrm{P}_{3}+\ldots+\mathrm{P}_{3}$$
- Probability of ALI of the independent events will occur $=\mathrm{P}_{1} * \mathrm{P}_{2} * \mathrm{P}_{2} * * \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{n}}$

Tree diagrams are 11 serul to show all possible outcomes of a sequence of events, that helps determine the probability of a combination of events.

\section*{Chapter 5 : Boolean Algebra (I)}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt:
* the importance of two-state (TRUE/FALSE) logic in computing;
* model logical relations by truth tables, Venn diagrams, switching circuits or 'gates'.

\subsection*{5.1 Introduction}

In programming, especially in selection or branching statements, we need to specify conditions. These conditions are either satisfied or not satisfied, in other words they are either TRUE or FALSE. Thus undet tanding of this two-state (TRUE or FALSE) logic is fundamental in progran aing, it will help to identify many logic errors that would be made otherwise.

In digital electronics, devices like digital omputers, calculators fundamentally work on two-state, 1 or 0 , (ON or OPR). There are tiny circuit elements which operate on the two states, they are called Logic Gates. In this chapter, we will know more about AND, OR, NOT, NAND.

\subsection*{5.2 Logic in Programniils}

Sooner or later, in ar bat the simplest of programs, we meet a situation where we have to write sontthing like "IF so-and-so THEN DO something, ELSE DO something dífurent". This means that we must be able to model the problem in two-state logical terms, i.e. outcome is YES or NO.

In many cases, we may be making several logical decisions within a single line of code. If, for example, we are sorting data into the classes which we used for our statistical distribution of the run-times, we might well do so by a line such as:
```
IF x < 7 THEN
        C1 \leftarrowC1 +1
ELSE IF X < 11 THEN
            C2}\leftarrow\textrm{C}2+
    ELSE IF X < 15 THEN
                C3\leftarrowC3+1
            ELSE C4\leftarrowC4+1
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
ENDIF
```

This involves compound decisions within which each single decision must be logically correct, without any doubt whatever.

This is the realm of two-state logic, also referred to as Binary Logic and we use ' 1 ' for true or yes and ' 0 ' for false or no.

\subsection*{5.3 Logic and Hardware}

We shall also need to know precisely how the logical two-state system maps on to a physical two-state switching system if we become involved with assembly languages or the theory and architecture of the computer, or if we need to program any process control applications.

Today such systems, from controlling traffic lights to running the cycles of a washing machine, embody the logical models in various arrangements of miniaturised transistor switches in 'chips'. In this context, 'yes' ordinarily translates as 'switch on' and 'no' as 'switch off'.

\subsection*{5.4 Language and Symbols}

A different language \& some new symbols:

\section*{STATEMENT}
- Used in two-state logic to mean any ingle proposition which can only be TRUE or FALSE.

We now venture into total certainty, which associates YES with TRUE and binary 1; NO with FALSE and bini ry 0.

Statements may be COMFCUND, when we associate two or more by the conjunction AND, or by theaisjunction OR.

We often use the netters p, q and r as the symbols for this sort of logical statement. In partip, lar, the compound statement $\mathrm{p}^{\wedge} \mathrm{q}$ means 'the consequences' of the two stat:ments in conjunction. The consequences refer to the four possible results of ar y ompound of two statements.

Similarly, p v q indicates the possible results of the disjunction of p, q. 'NOT p' is symbolised by $\sim p$.

\subsection*{5.5 Truth Tables}

Let us now use our primary tool for simplifying the NOT, AND and OR models, the truth table.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{p}$ & $\mathbf{q}$ & $\mathbf{p}^{\wedge} \mathbf{q}(\mathbf{p}$ AND q) & $\mathbf{p} \mathbf{~ q ~ q ~ ( p ~ O R ~ q ) ~}$ \\
\hline \hline False & False & False & False \\
\hline False & True & False & True \\
\hline True & False & False & True \\
\hline True & True & True & True \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

In logic, we distinguish between OR, meaning in either of the named sets or their intersection, and XOR (exclusive OR), which means in either but not both.

\subsection*{5.6 Logical Equivalence}

The use of truth tables leads also to another condition, the logical equivalence of compound statements. If the outcomes of two truth tables are identical, the statements which they represent are logically equivalent and we use the ' $=$ ' symbol to represent this state.

For example, $\sim(p \wedge q)=(p \sim v \sim q)$
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{p}$ & $\mathbf{q}$ & $\mathbf{p}^{\wedge} \mathbf{q}$ & $\sim(\mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q})$ & $\sim \mathbf{p}$ & $\sim \mathbf{q}$ & $\sim \mathbf{p} \mathbf{v} \sim \mathbf{q}$ \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The compound statements will often include racie than two propositions and the table may then become quite large.

If the compound statement were ' p $\hat{A} N \mathrm{ND}$ q OR $r$ ' we might find that the interpreter we are using automatically takes the 'AND' before the 'OR', but is often safer to use brackets whilct $w$ e are working on the model and write it as (p $\wedge \mathrm{q})$ v r and to insert result, which $\mathrm{s} \mathrm{p} \wedge \mathrm{q}$ :
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{p}$ & $\mathbf{q}$ & $\mathbf{( p \wedge \mathbf { q } )}$ & $\mathbf{r}$ & $\left(\mathbf{p}^{\wedge} \mathbf{q}\right) \mathbf{v} \mathbf{r}$ \\
\hline 0 & $\times 5$ & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

With three statements, we must ensure that the program includes all the combinations which can give rise to 8 possible results.

Example: For the boolean expression
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Z}=\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \cdot \mathrm{C} \\
& \mathrm{Z}=\mathrm{A} \text { OR } \overline{(\mathrm{B}} \text { AND (NOT) C) }
\end{aligned}$$
or

The truth table is as follows:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ & $\mathbf{C}$ & $\mathbf{C}$ & $\mathbf{B} . \overline{\mathrm{C}}$ & $\mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B} \overline{\mathbf{C}}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Example: For the boolean expression
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Z}=(\mathrm{A} . \mathrm{B})+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D} \\
& \mathrm{Z}=(\mathrm{A} \text { AND } \overline{\mathrm{B}}) \mathrm{OR}(\text { NOT C) OR D }
\end{aligned}$$

The truth table is as follows:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ & $\mathbf{C}$ & $\mathbf{D}$ & $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{R}$ & $\overline{\mathbf{C}}$ & $\mathbf{Z}=(\mathbf{A . B})+\overline{\mathbf{C}}+\mathbf{D}$ \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 1 & & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & - & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Truth Tables can be used to prove the logic equality of two different boolean expressions, as shown in the example below.

Example: To prove:
$$A \cdot(A+B)=A+A \cdot B=A$$

Truth table for A.(A + B)
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ & $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}$ & $\mathbf{A} .(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Truth table for A + A . B
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ & A.B & $\mathbf{A +} \mathbf{A . B}$ \\
\hline \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The two expressions $A .(A+B)$ and $A+A . B$ are shown to be logically equivalent, because they have the same outputs in the above truth tables.

Note also that these outputs are also exactly the sane as the inputs for A.
Therefore it is proven that
$$A \cdot(A+B)=A+A \cdot B=A$$

\subsection*{5.7 Switching Diagrams}

It has long been the practice w illustrate such possibilities, in Control Systems, by reference to diagrams showin the switching On and Off of an electric light.

The switching function is carried out, within the computer, by circuits known as Logic Gates, for wich statements have to be converted to electrical voltages, still identified as ' 1 or ' 0 ' for 'On' and 'Off' but with individual statements, or Inputs, labelied as A, B, C, and so on whilst consequences, or Outputs, are labelled X, 1, Z.

These 'gates' are represented in diagrams as shown below but, just as with a truth table, compound statements may give any number of 'inputs' and gates may be combined in many different ways.

The AND gate
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-077.jpg?height=152&width=403&top_left_y=2059&top_left_x=1237)

The OR gate

Here $A \wedge B$ is represented as A.B and $A v B$ is represented as $A+B$. So the twoinput AND gate means that to generate a voltage, indicated by ' 1 ' at the output, we must apply voltage at all inputs. For the OR gate, a voltage at the output is generated by an appropriate voltage at any one or more inputs.

If we have a statement, 'IF in A AND NOT in B THEN DO ...', then we see that we need to invert an input (or an output) to conform to our logical model.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-077.jpg?height=181&width=1431&top_left_y=2621&top_left_x=335)

\subsection*{5.7.1 AND Function (or AND gate)}

The AND gate circuit symbol is as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-078.jpg?height=147&width=420&top_left_y=720&top_left_x=886)

A basic AND gate has two inputs A and B , and one output C . All $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and C are logical and binary variables which can only be ' 0 ' or ' 1 ' i.e. A, B and C are bits in nature.

The analogy of the AND gate is as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-078.jpg?height=489&width=906&top_left_y=1206&top_left_x=672)
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline SwitiA & Switch B & Lamp C \\
\hline UFF & OFF & OFF \\
\hline OFF & ON & OFF \\
\hline ON & OFF & OFF \\
\hline ON & ON & ON \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The AND function output C is a 1 (True) only if both inputs $\mathrm{A}=1$ AND $\mathrm{B}=1$, or else, output $\mathrm{C}=0$. This can be better represented by a truth table which relates the output to all possible input conditions.

A Truth Table shows the relationship between input conditions and output.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Switch A & Switch B & Lamp C \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

When input A and B are both ' 1 ', the output will be ' 1 '.
Mathematically, this can be expressed in a boolean equation as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { or } & \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{~B}(\text { read as } \mathrm{A} \text { AND } \mathrm{B}) \\
\mathrm{C} & =\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{~B}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example: A 3-input AND gate:}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-079.jpg?height=178&width=502&top_left_y=893&top_left_x=942)
is the same as

The truth table is as follows.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ Output } \\
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ & $\mathbf{C}$ & $\mathbf{D}$ \\

\hline 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{5.7.2 OR Function (or OR gate)}

The OR gate circuit symbol is as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-079.jpg?height=158&width=392&top_left_y=2461&top_left_x=934)

The analogy of an OR gate is as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-080.jpg?height=515&width=883&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=677)
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Switch A & Switch B & Lamp C \\
\hline \hline OFF & OFF & OFF \\
\hline OFF & ON & ON \\
\hline ON & OFF & ON \\
\hline ON & ON & ON \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It can also be represented by the folloving truth table:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Switch A & Switch B & Lamp C \\
\hline \hline 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

That is, an OR gate output $\mathrm{C}=1$ if either $\mathrm{A}=1 \mathrm{OR} \mathrm{B}=1$. Otherwise $\mathrm{C}=0$
Mathematically, this can be expressed in a boolean equation as:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { or } & C=A+B(\text { read as A OR B) } \\
& C=A \cup B
\end{array}$$

\subsection*{5.7.3 NOT Function (or NOT gate)}

The NOT gate circuit symbol is as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-080.jpg?height=164&width=417&top_left_y=2413&top_left_x=976)

The action of a NOT gate is quite simple. It functions like an inverter. That is, the output is the inverted value of the input. For example, if $A=0$ then $B=1$, and if $\mathrm{A}=1$ then $\mathrm{B}=0$.

The truth table is as follows:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{A}$ & $\mathbf{B}$ \\
\hline 0 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Mathematically, this can be expressed in a boolean equation as:
$$\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{A}(\text { read as complement } \mathrm{A} \text { or bar } \mathrm{A})$$

Note: $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$ can also be represented as A'.

\subsection*{5.7.4 Other Logical Functions}

AND, OR and NOT are known as the basic gates There are other gates and logical functions used in computers which are filt from the three basic gates.

NAND function (i.e. NOT-AND function)
NOR function (i.e. NOT-OR function)
NAND and NOR gates are known as the universal building elements which are used to build more complex logic:l functions like the Adder (which we will cover later in the chapter).

Mathematically, this can be expressed in a boolean equation as:
$$\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{A} . \mathrm{B}$$

The truth table is as follows:

\subsection*{5.8 Combining Logic Gates}

Many everyday digital logic problems use several logic gates. The most common pattern of gates is shown below. This pattern is called the AND-OR pattern. The outputs of the AND gates (1 and 2) are used as inputs to the OR gate (3). You will notice that this logic circuit has three inputs ( $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and C ). The output of the entire circuit is labelled as Z.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-084.jpg?height=1608&width=1260&top_left_y=612&top_left_x=597)

Let us first determine the boolean expression that will describe this logic circuit. Begin the examination at gate (1). This is a 2-input AND gate. The output of this gate is A.B (A AND B). This expression is written at the output of gate(1) in figure (b) above.

Gate(2) is also a 2-input AND gate. The output of this gate is B.C (B AND C). This expression is written at the output of gate(2). Next the output of gate(1) and (2) are OR-ed together by gate(3). Figure (c) shows A . B being OR-ed with B .
C.

The resulting boolean expression is $\mathrm{Z}=\mathrm{A} . \mathrm{B}+\mathrm{B} . \mathrm{C}$. It is read as (A AND B) OR (B AND C). You will notice that the AND-ing is done first, followed by the OR-ing.

Example: A logic circuit is given as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-085.jpg?height=392&width=989&top_left_y=752&top_left_x=727)

The boolean expression is $Z=(\bar{A}+D) \cdot(C+D)$
Example: A logic circuit is given as follorvs:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-085.jpg?height=410&width=997&top_left_y=1325&top_left_x=732)

The boolean expression is $\mathrm{Z}=\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{B}+\overline{\mathrm{A}} \cdot \overline{\mathrm{B}}$

\subsection*{5.8.1 Analysing Circuits}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-085.jpg?height=503&width=1000&top_left_y=1989&top_left_x=642)
$$\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{~B} \cdot \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{A} \cdot \overline{\mathrm{~B}} \cdot \mathrm{C}+\overline{\mathrm{A}} \cdot \mathrm{~B}$$

From the diagram, we see that each of the outputs from the 3 AND gates will be a ' 1 ' or a ' 0 ' and they serve as the inputs to the 'OR' gate which is represented by the ' + ' sign.

Switching circuits are often over-complicated because they duplicate or even triplicate or quadruplicate functions. The results of rigorous simplification can, however, be quite startling.

$$\mathrm{X}=\overline{\mathrm{A}} \cdot \mathrm{~B}+\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{C}$$

Simplified circuit

\subsection*{5.9 The Algebra of Logic}

We shall now investigate how to achieve such results using Boolean Algebra. Note that in two-state logic, we have 4, 4 and two operators, ' + ' as in A + B for 'OR' and '.' as in A.B for 'AND'.

Using these symbols, we have
$\mathrm{A}+\overline{\mathrm{A}}=1$
A. $\overline{\mathrm{A}}=0$
$\mathrm{A}+0=\mathrm{A}$
A. $1=\mathrm{A}$
A. $0=$ ?
$\mathrm{A}+1=1$

With referere to SETS, where $\cup$ represents union and $\cap$ represents intersection.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{A} & (\mathrm{~A} O R \mathrm{~B}=\mathrm{A} \cup \mathrm{~B}=\mathrm{B} \cup \mathrm{~A}) \\
\mathrm{A} . \mathrm{B}=\mathrm{B} \cdot \mathrm{~A} & (\mathrm{~A} \mathrm{AND} \mathrm{~B}=\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{~B}=\mathrm{B} \cap \mathrm{~A}) \\
& \left(\text { NOT } \mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}^{\prime}\right)
\end{array}$$

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt:
* to analyse and simplify circuits by Boolean Algebra;
* to draw a logic circuit.

\subsection*{6.1 Introduction}

In addition to our 'ordinary' Boolean algebra, De Morgan's Laws is one tool used for simplifying complex expressions in Boolean algebra or complex switching circuits.

\mathrm{~A} \cdot(\mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{B}) & =\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{~B}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{6.3 Simplification of Expressions}

The rules given may be used to simplify Boolean expression, just as the rules of normal algebra may be used to simplify expression. Consider the expression
$$(A+B)(A+\bar{B})(\bar{A}+C)$$

The first two terms consist of $A+B$ and $A+\bar{B}$; these terms may be multiplied and, since $A+A \bar{B}+A B=A$ and $B \bar{B}=0$, reduced $A$.

The expression has been reduced now to $A(\bar{A}+C)$, which may be expressed as $A \bar{A}+A C$. And since $\bar{A} A$ is equal to 0 , the entire expression $(A+B)(\bar{A}+\bar{B})$ $(\bar{A}+C)$ may be reduced to AC.

Another expression that may be simplified is $A B C+A \bar{B} C+A B \bar{C}$. First, the expression may be written $A(B C+\overline{B C}+B \bar{C})$. Ther asdan, we may simplify to $A[B(C+\bar{C})+\overline{B C}]$; and since $C+\bar{C}=1$, we have $1(\overline{5}+\overline{B C})$.

The expression $A(B+\bar{B} C)$ may be furth recuced to $A(B+C)$. The final expression can be written in two ways: $A(5+C)$ or $A B+A C$. The first expression is generally preferable if the equation is to be constructed as an electronic circuit, because it requireon one AND circuit and one OR circuit.

\subsection*{6.4 De Morgan's Laws}

The following two rule, onstitute De Morgan's Laws:
$$\begin{aligned}
& (\overline{\mathrm{A}}+\overline{\mathrm{B}})=\overline{\mathrm{A}} \cdot \overline{\mathrm{~B}} \\
& (\mathrm{~A} \cdot \mathrm{~B})=\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}
\end{aligned}$$

The complement of any Boolean expression, or part of any expression, may be found by means by this law. Using these rules, two steps are used to form a complement:

Step 1 The + symbols are replaced with . symbols and . symbols with + symbols.

Step 2 Each of the terms in the expression is complemented.

The use of De Morgan's laws may be demonstrated by finding the complement of the expression $A+B C$. First, note that a multiplication sign has been omitted, and the expression could be written $A+(B . C)$. To complement this, the addition symbol is replaced with a multiplication symbols, and the two terms are complemented, giving $A .(B . \overline{C)}$; then the remaining term is complemented: $\quad A(B$ $\mp C)$. The following equivalence has been found: $(A+B C)=A(B+C)$

The complement of $A B+C D$ may be formed by two steps:

Step 1 The addition symbol is changed.
Step 2 The complement of each term is formed: $(\overline{\overline{A .} B})(C \bar{D})$
This become $(A+\bar{B})(\bar{C}+D)$

Since A and D were already complemented, they become uncomplemented by the laws $A=\bar{A}$.

An example of showing how DeMorgan's laws can be applied.
Show that $\overline{A \cdot B}+\overline{A \cdot B}=\overline{A \cdot B}$
L.H.S $=\bar{A} \cdot \bar{B}+(\overline{\mathrm{A}}+\overline{\mathrm{B}})$

$$=A \cdot B+A \cdot 1+B$$
$$=A \cdot B+A+B$$
$$=A \cdot B+A \cdot(B+B)+B$$
$$=\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B}+\underline{A} \cdot B+B$$
$$\begin{aligned}

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt:
* the basic concepts of different data structures;

\subsection*{7.1 Introduction}

A data structure specifies interrelationships among data. Each data structure has unique characteristics that make it different from any oth er.

The study of data structures involves learning about various interrelationships that data can have within each unique structure,

It is important for you to understand that the data maybe unchanged, while data structures do change.

\subsection*{7.3 Arrays and Spreadsheets}

It is especially easy to manipulate arrays using spreadsheets. It allows very quick calculation and re-calculation of large matrices. This allows WHAT IF' analysis to be performed. Try this out during your Lotus 1-2-3 lessons.

Arrays on paper is limited to 2 dimensional but multi-dimensional array can specify on spreadsheets and even in programming languages more than 2 dimensional arrays are required to store related variable. For example, in the analysis of aircraft movement such as pitching yaw and rolling.

How many Dimensional Array Reqrinet?
Ans: (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 )
Another use of the array is the storing numbers and string arrays respectively. String arrays can be oporated on by concatenation of the elements in the respective arrays.

Array addresses, in the computer can be assigned by having two bytes for each number. For areredy size of $4 * 7$, the total number of bytes $4 * 7 * 2=52$, the first quarter 14 bres are the first row and next 14 bytes for the next row and so on.

\subsection*{7.4 Lists}

A record consists of different data items stored in an array.
Below is a list consisting of four data items that are not linked. An example is given below.

Four lists which must stay 'linked'.

\subsection*{7.5 Linked List}

A linked list, or one-way list, is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where the linear order is given by means of pointers. That is, each node is divided into two parts : the first part contains the information of the element, and the second part, called the link field or next pointer field, contains the address of the next node in the list.

\section*{Example: Linked list with 3 nodes}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-104.jpg?height=390&width=1248&top_left_y=747&top_left_x=512)

A more useful application of a list is a linked list. The Invoice Number, Customer Number, Date and Amount are linked by a trou way pointer.

Accessing any of the data items allows the access to the others

\section*{Example:}

Program Lists with pointers

\subsection*{7.6 Queues}

The queue is yet another data structure which differs in a number of ways from the stack. It may be used in real-time processing, fol scheduling of jobs in the context of an operating systems or in other simil s applications such as data transfer.

It is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure which means that the first item to enter the queue is the first item to leave ancra items always get added to the end of the queue.

As with the stack we can represent a queue by a one-dimensional array with the need for two pointers. The first to indicate the front of the queue and the other to indicate the next space capate of holding an element joining the queue, these being the head and tail poiniers respectively.

A method of inserting and retrieving data is similar to a stack but on 'FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-106.jpg?height=452&width=775&top_left_y=1795&top_left_x=686)
1. 'POP'
2. 'LIST'
3. 'PUSH'

The queue operation is awkward because the elements are pushed to the front and new elements are added from the bottom, sometimes referred to as a PUSHUP STACK or LIST.

Other types of queues can be the DEQUE (or DOUBLE - ended - Queue) and the WRAP - AROUND - STACK.

\subsection*{7.6.1 DEQUE}

Data are push and pop (add and delete) from both ends.

\subsection*{7.6.2 Wrap-Around-Stack (Circular queue)}

In this type the tail pointer cannot be pushed out but moves in a circular manner ahead of the head pointer.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-107.jpg?height=738&width=966&top_left_y=687&top_left_x=633)

\subsection*{7.7 Stacks}

The stack is an exampic a data structure found quite commonly in computing which is especially ased in system software. They may by used to carry out stages of a calculation ter handling interruptions in translation programs or to pass information from a main program to a subprogram.

The main physical characteristic of a stack is that it is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure. It can be likened to a pile of plates in which it is easy (if sometime a little unstable) to add extra plates to the top. Plates can also be easily removed from the top of the pile, but not by extrication from the bottom of the pile.

We can represent a stock as a one-dimensional array with two pointers, one pointing to the base of the stack (to identify the first element) and the other pointing to the position of the first available element, this being called the stack pointer. These are only two possible operations that can be done with a stack, namely adding an item to the top of the stack (called stacking or pushing) and the other is that of popping, or taking an item off the stack.

An example of Stack Operation.
DIM S(50)
REM **PUSHING SEQUENCE**
IF P <= 50 THEN 120
PRINT "STACK FULL"
STOP
LET $S(P)=E$
LET $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}+1$
GOTO 90

\subsection*{7.7.1 Corruption by Machine}

Machines and computers fot 'clean up'!
A 'POP' operation Erecly copies a datum from a memory location to another leaving the previcts uatum intact.

For a pusi, make sure the location is empty else 'Invoice'; into a location previously iold a longer string 'calendar' on retrieving gives 'Invoicer'.

Hence Corruption of Data!!

\section*{Points to Remember}

An array is a storage area in primary memory. Each data entry stored in an array is accessed with a single subscript or index value.
Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional.
Arithmetic operations applied to a two-dimensional table result in a matrix.
Linked list is data structures that permit records in a file or entries in an array to be maintained in logical order without remaining in physical order.

Linked list uses a pair of pointers: the head (list) pointer for the start of the list and tail pointer for the last entry.

Stacks are data structures which exhibit behaviour known as LIFO (last in, first out).
Additions to a stack are 'PUSHED' onto the top of it and deletion are 'POPED' singly off the top.
Stacks use a pair of pointers: the head and the tail poirttr.
Queues are data structures that exhibit FIFO (first in, tirst out) behaviour.
Queues use a pair of pointers: the head poiner, ind the tail pointer which indicate the next available location.

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt:
* how to acquire the ability to manipulate or to use the different types if data structures;
* how to construct and traverse a binary tree;
* comparison of data structures.

\subsection*{8.1 Introduction}

So far, we have been studying mainly linear types ct data structures: strings, arrays, lists, stacks and queues. This section defire: a non-linear data structure called a tree. This structure is mainly use(1) to represent data containing a hierarchical relationship between elements. E.z. records, family trees and tables of contents.

First we investigate a special kind f tee, called a binary tree, which can be easily maintained in the compure flthough such a tree may seen to be very restrictive, we will see later in the section that more general trees may be viewed as binary trees.

Question: Can you understand the logic of the binary tree?

\subsection*{8.3 Tables}

In tables, there are basically 4 types of pointers:
i. Left Pointer;
ii. Right Pointer;
iii. Back Pointer/Parent Pointer;
iv. Trace Pointer.

The Pointers point to the left, right of the tree trace where they come from or to the next node of the tree. This to preserve the structure of the tree.

The node number takes positive integers and ' -1 ' has special meaning.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline NODE & DATUM & LP & RP \\
\hline 1 & Malaysia & 4 & 2 \\
\hline 2 & Namibia & 3 & 6 \\
\hline 3 & Mauritius & -1 & -1 \\
\hline 4 & Bahrain & -1 & 5 \\
\hline 5 & Hong Kong & 8 & 10 \\
\hline 6 & Pakistan & -1 & 7 \\
\hline 7 & Sri Lark & 9 & -1 \\
\hline 8 & Botswana & -1 & -1 \\
\hline 9 & Sirdapore & -1 & -1 \\
\hline 10 & India & -1 & -1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The above tree is mapped into to give the following:
$\left[\begin{array}{r}\text { Malaysia } \\ \text { Namibia } \\ \text { Mauritius } \\ \text { Bahrain } \\ \text { Hong Kong } \\ \text { Pakistan } \\ \text { Sri Lanka } \\ \text { Botswana } \\ \text { Singapore } \\ \text { Indin }\end{array}\right] \quad\left[\begin{array}{rr}4 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 \\ -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 5 \\ 8 & 10 \\ -1 & 7 \\ 9 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 \\ -1 & -1\end{array}\right]$

Using the full set of pointers, the final tree can be represented below:
$\left[\begin{array}{c}\text { Malaysia } \\ \text { Namibia } \\ \text { Mauritius } \\ \text { Bahrain } \\ \text { Hong Kong } \\ \text { Pakistan } \\ \text { Sri Lanka } \\ \text { Botswana } \\ \text { Singapore } \\ \text { Indin }\end{array}\right] \quad\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}4 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\ 3 & 6 & 1 & 6 \\ -1 & -1 & 2 & 2 \\ -1 & 5 & 1 & 8 \\ 8 & 10 & 4 & 10 \\ -1 & 7 & 2 & 9 \\ 9 & -1 & 6 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 & 5 & 5 \\ -1 & -1 & 7 & 7 \\ -1 & -1 & 5 & 1\end{array}\right]$

\subsection*{8.4 Binary Tries}

A binary tree T is defined as finite set of elements, called nodes such that:
T is empty (called the null tree or empty tree), or
T contains a distinguished node R , called the root of T , and the remaining nodes of T form an ordered pair of disjoint binary trees $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{2}$.

If $T$ does contain a root $R$, then the two trees $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are called, respectively, the left and right subtrees of R . If $\mathrm{T}_{1}$ is non-empty, then its root is called the left successor of $R$; similarly, if $T_{2}$ is non-empty, then its root is called the right successor of R.

\section*{Example: Software}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-115.jpg?height=443&width=977&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=565)

A binary tree T is frequently presented by means of a diagram. Specifically, the diagram above represents a binary tree T as follows.

T consists of 8 nodes, represented by the letters sthrough e.
The root of T is the node s at the top of the diagram.
A left-downward slanted line from a node sindicate a ieft successor of $s$ and a right-downward slanted line from s indicates a ight successor of s .

Observe that:
O is a left successor and t is a right successor of the node s.
The left subtle of the root s consists of the nodes $\mathrm{o}, \mathrm{f}, \mathrm{r}, \mathrm{a}$ and e , and the right subtree of $s$ consists of the nodes $t$ and $w$.

\subsection*{8.5 Traversing of Bina-y Erees}

There are three stà aed ways of traversing a binary tree T with root R . These three algorithms raliled preorder, inorder and postorder, are as follows:

Preorder:
1. Process the root R.
2. Traverse the left subtree of R in preorder.
3. Traverse the right subtree of R in preorder.

Inorder: $\quad 1 . \quad$ Traverse the left subtree of R in inorder.
2. Process the root R.
3. Traverse the right subtree of R in inorder.

Postorder 1. Traverse the left subtree of R in postorder.
2. Traverse the right subtree of R in postorder.
3. Process the root R.

\section*{A simple example of Binary Tree}

\subsection*{8.5.1 Preorder Traversal}

The preorder traversal of T processes A, traverses LT and traverses RT. However, the preorder traversal of LT processes the root B and then D and E , and the preorder traversal of RT processes the root C and then F . Hence ABDECF is the preorder traversal of T .

\subsection*{8.5.2 Inorder Traversal}

The inorder traversal of T traverses LT, processes A and traverses RT. However, the inorder traversal of LT processes D, B and then E, and the inorder traversal of RT processes C and then F . Hence DBEACF is the inorder traversal of T.

\subsection*{8.5.3 Postorder Traversal}

The postorder traversal of $T$ traverses $L T$, traverse: $R T$, and processes $A$. However, the postorder traversal of LT processes $\mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}$ and then B , and the postorder traversal of RT processes F and then C. EFcordingly, DEBFCA is the postorder traversal of T.

\subsection*{8.6 Binary Search Trees}

This section discusses one of the most important data structures in computer science, a binary search tree. Thics structure enables one to search for an element. It also enables one to easil insert and delete elements. This structure contrasts with the following structires:

\section*{Binary Search Tree}

\subsection*{8.7 Searching and Inserting in Binary Search Trees}

Suppose T is a binary search tree. This section discusses the basic operations of searching and inserting with respect to T . In fact, the searching and inserting will be given by a single search and insertion algorithm.

Suppose an ITEM of information is given. The following algorithm finds the location of ITEM in the binary search tree T, or inserts ITEM as a new node in its appropriate place in the tree.
a. Compare ITEM with the root node N of the tree.
i. If ITEM $<N$, proceed to the left subtree of $N$.
ii. If ITEM $>\mathrm{N}$, proceed to the right subtree of N .
b. Repeat Step (a) until one of the following occurs:
i. We meet a node N such that ITEM $=\mathrm{N}$. In this case the search is successful.
ii. We meet an empty subtree, which in incates that the search is unsuccessful, and we insert ITEM ir. place of the empty subtree.

In other, proceed from the root R down thougla the tree T until finding ITEM in T or inserting ITEM as a terminal node in T.

\section*{Example:}

Consider the binary seanci: tree T below. Suppose ITEM $=20$ is given. Simulating the above $a^{1} g$ ri.hm, we obtain the following steps:

Compare ITEM $=20$ with tine root, 38 , of the tree T. Since $20<38$, proceed to the left child of 38 , which is 11

Compare ITEM $=$ ? 0 with 14 . Since $20>14$, proceed to the right child of 14 , which is 23 .
Compare ITEM $=20$ with 23. Since $20<23$, proceed to the left child of 23 , which is 18 .
Compare ITEM $=20$ with 18 . Since $20>18$ and 18 does not have a right child, insert 20 as the right child of 18 .

\section*{Points to Remember}

Binary trees are non-linear data structures in which the root and each node on the tree contain a maximum of two children.
A binary tree can be created within an array using left and right child pointers similar to linked list concepts.
Additions, changes and deletions of a left node are fairly easy.
The 4 types of pointers in a binary can be represented in a form of a table.

* to define a matrix and the types of matrix;
* to understand the order of a matrix;
* to perform simple algebra on matrix;
* to relate shapes and their movements in space through matrices;

\subsection*{9.1 Introduction}

Here, we exploit the ability te emulate and to manipulate entities in spatial terms. Ultimately these basic ideas tend to controlling machine and its tools.

Some of us may haveseen this in computer applications such as DTP, CAD or CAM.

\subsection*{9.2 Definitions}

A matrix is a rectangle array of $m$ rows and $n$ columns, where $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers. Such a matrix is said to be of order mx n .

\section*{Example:}
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4 \\
5 & 6
\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{lll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} & \mathrm{c} \\
\mathrm{~d} & \mathrm{e} & \mathrm{f}
\end{array}\right) \text { and }\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-9 & 0 \\
-1 & 2
\end{array}\right) \text { are matrices. }$$

Their orders are $3 \times 2,2 \times 3$ and $2 \times 2$ respectively.
An m x 1 matrix is known as a column vector or column matrix.
An nx n matrix is known as a square matrix.
A $1 \times \mathrm{m}$ matrix is known as a row matrix.

The matrix $\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$ is called the unit matrix. It is usually represented by the symbol I. When any matrix is multiplied by the unit matrix. The matrix remains unchanged. That is I.A = A.I = A where A is a matrix

\section*{Example:}
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} \\
\mathrm{c} & \mathrm{~d}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} \\
\mathrm{c} & \mathrm{~d}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} \\
\mathrm{c} & \mathrm{~d}
\end{array}\right)$$

An matrix whose elements are all zeros is called a zero matrix.

\section*{Example:}
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{lll}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right) \text { and }\binom{0}{0} \text { are all zero matrices. }$$

When any matrix is multiplied by the zero matrix. The result is a zero matrix.

\section*{Example:}
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} \\
\mathrm{c} & \mathrm{~d}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{a} & \mathrm{~b} \\
\mathrm{c} & \mathrm{~d}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)$$

The zero matrix is sometimes written simply as 0 so that if $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ is multiplied by 0 , we could write it as: $0 . \mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A} .0=0$

\subsection*{9.3 Rules/Matrix Algebra}

Two matrices can be added only if they are of the same order. The rule for addition is shown by the following example.

\section*{Example:}
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c \\
b & d
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{ll}
e & f \\
g & h
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a+e & c+f \\
b+g & d+h
\end{array}\right)$$

\section*{Example:}
$$\begin{aligned}
& \left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{ll}
7 & 8 \\
1 & 9
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4+7 & 9+8 \\
3+1 & 5+9
\end{array}\right) \\
& = \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
11 & 17 \\
4 & 14
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Two matirics can be subtracted only if they are of the same order. The rule for subtraction is shown by the following example.

Example:
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c \\
b & d
\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{ll}
e & f \\
g & h
\end{array}\right) & =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c \\
b & d
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-e & -f \\
-g & -h
\end{array}\right) \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a-e & c-f \\
b-g & d-h
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example:}
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{ll}
7 & 8 \\
1 & 9
\end{array}\right) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
4-7 & 9-8 \\
3-1 & 5-9
\end{array}\right) \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-3 & 1 \\
2 & -4
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

The rule for multiplying matrices is:
$$\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c \\
b & d
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
e & f \\
g & h
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a e+c g & a f+c h \\
b e+d g & b f+d h
\end{array}\right)$$

Multiplying other matrices is done in the same manner but the number of columns of the first matrix must be the same as the number of rows of the second matrix.

\section*{Example:}
$$\begin{aligned}
& \left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & c \\
b & d
\end{array}\right)\binom{e}{f}=\binom{d f+c f}{b e+d f} \\
& \left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
c & d \\
e & f
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
g & h \\
i & j \\
j
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example:}
$$\text { Niultiply }\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)\binom{6}{2}$$

Solution:
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)\binom{6}{2} & =\binom{4 \times 6+9 \times 2}{3 \times 6+5 \times 2} \\
& =\binom{24+18}{18+10} \\
& =\binom{42}{28}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example:}
$$\text { Multiply }\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 4 \\
1 & 3
\end{array}\right)$$

Solution:
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 & 9 \\
3 & 5
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 4 \\
1 & 3
\end{array}\right) & =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
4 \times 2+9 \times 1 & 4 \times 4+9 \times 3 \\
3 \times 2+5 \times 1 & 3 \times 4+5 \times 3
\end{array}\right) \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
8+9 & 16+27 \\
6+5 & 12+15
\end{array}\right) \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
17 & 43 \\
11 & 27
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

If $A$ and $B$ represent two matrices, then
$\mathrm{AB} \neq \mathrm{BA}$
i.e. in matrices, the order of multiplication is not commutative.

Two matrices are equal if and onty of their corresponding elements are equal.
Thus, if $\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & c \\ b & d\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}e & 1 \\ d & h\end{array}\right)$
then it follows trata $=\mathrm{e}, \mathrm{b}=\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{c}=\mathrm{g}$ and $\mathrm{d}=\mathrm{h}$.
If $\binom{x}{y}=\binom{2}{3}$ then it follows that $x=2$ and $y=3$.

When a matrix is multiplied by a constant, every element in the matrix is enlarged by the constant.

Thus, $c\left(\begin{array}{cc}p & q \\ r & s\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}c p & c q \\ c r & c s\end{array}\right)$

If $A$ and $B$ are any two matrices, $A B=0$ does no necessarily imply that either $A$ $=0$ or $\mathrm{B}=0$.

\section*{Example:}

If $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right) \quad$ and $B=\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$
$$A B=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right)$$

Unlike ordinary algebra, the fact that $\mathrm{AB}=\mathrm{AC}$ does not necessarily imply that B $=\mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Example:}

If $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{array}\right) \quad$ and $B=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{array}\right) \quad$ and $C=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$
then $\mathrm{AB}=\mathrm{AC}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{array}\right)$

But $B \neq C$ and $A \neq 0$

\section*{Example:}

Given $A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 3 \\ 4 & -1\end{array}\right) \quad$ and $B=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}2 & 0 & -4 \\ 3 & -2 & 6\end{array}\right)$

\section*{Solution.}

Since $A$ is $2 \times 2$ and $B$ is $2 \times 3$, the product matrix $A B$ is defined and is a $2 x$ 3 matrix. To obtain the elements in the first row of the product matrix $A B$, multiply the first row (13) of A by the columns.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \binom{2}{3},\binom{0}{-2} \text { and }\binom{-4}{6} \text { of B respectively. } \\
& \left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
2 & -1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 0 & -4 \\
3 & -2 & 6
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Step 1:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad(1 \times 2+3 x 3 \quad 1 \times 0-3 x(-2) \quad 1 x(-4)+3 x 6) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad(11-614)
\end{aligned}$$

To obtain the elements in the second row of the product matrix $A B$, multiply the second row $(2,-1)$ of $A$ by the columns of $B$ respectively.
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
2 & -1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 0 & -4 \\
3 & -2 & 6
\end{array}\right)$$

Step 2:
$$\begin{aligned}
& 11 \quad-6 \quad 14 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad(2 x 2+(-1) x 3 \quad 2 x 0+(-1) x(-2) \quad 2 x(-4)+(-1) \times 6) \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
11 & -6 & 14 \\
1 & 2 & -14
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Matrix multiplication does not obey the commutative law, i.e. the products AB and BA of matrices need not be equal.

\subsection*{9.4 Equivalent Matrices}

Two matrices are equal if and only if their consponding elements are equal. For instance, if
$A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5\end{array}\right), \quad$ and $B=\left(\begin{array}{ll}2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5\end{array}\right)$
then matrix $\mathrm{A}=$ matrix B .

\section*{Example:}

Given $\mathrm{A}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{x} & 2 \\ 1 & \mathrm{y}\end{array}\right), \quad \mathrm{B}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}3 & -5 \\ 4 & 2\end{array}\right) \quad$ and $\mathrm{C}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}8 & -3 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right)$
ddddddd. Find the values of x and y if $\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{C}$.
eeeeeee. Is $\mathrm{BC}=\mathrm{CB}$ ?
fffffff. Evaluate 3B.

\section*{Solution:}
$$\left.\begin{array}{rl}
\text { ggggggg. } & A+B \\
& =\left(\begin{array}{ll}
x & 2 \\
1 & y
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -5 \\
4 & 2
\end{array}\right) \\
1+4 & y+2
\end{array}\right) .$$

Since A $+B=C$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad\left(\begin{array}{cc}
x+3 & -3 \\
5 & y+2
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
8 & -3 \\
5 & 0
\end{array}\right) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad X-3=8 \text { and } y+2=0
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore $\mathrm{x}=5, \mathrm{y}=-2$
hhhhhhh. $\quad \mathrm{BC}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}3 & -5 \\ 4 & 2\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}8 & -3 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right)$
$=\left(\begin{array}{cc}24-25 & -9-6 \\ 32+10 & -12+0\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}-1 & -9 \\ 42 & -12\end{array}\right)$
$\mathrm{CB}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}8 & -3 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}3 & -5 \\ 4 & 2\end{array}\right)$
$=\left(\begin{array}{ll}24-12 & -40-6 \\ 15+0 & -25\end{array}\right)$
$=\left(\begin{array}{ll}12 & -46 \\ 15 & -25\end{array}\right)$
Thus $B C \neq C F$
iiiiii. $3 \mathrm{~B}=3\left(\begin{array}{cc}3 & -5 \\ 4 & 2\end{array}\right)$
$=\left(\begin{array}{cc}3 \times 3 & 3(-5) \\ 3 \times 4 & 3 \times 2\end{array}\right)$
$=\left(\begin{array}{cc}9 & -15 \\ 12 & 6\end{array}\right)$

Example: (A typical examination question)
A company makes two microcomputers, named SOLAR and GEM, using three main components $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z

SOLAR is made of 3 X components and 2Y components.
GEM is made of 2 X components and 3 Z components,
i. Express this information as a 2 by 3 array Q.

The company receives an ORDER for 100 SOLAR and 50 GEM microcomputers.
ii. Express the ORDER as a row matrix (array) P.
iii. Find the product PQ and interpret its meaning.
iv. If it takes 2 hours to produce the component $X, 1$ hour to produce $Y$ and 3 hours to produce Z , represent this information as a coloumn matrix R.
v. Calculate PQR and interpret its meaning?

A second order for 50 solar and 100 gem microcomp ter is subsequently received but by then New Production Techniques have resulted in the time needed to produce X cut by $20 \%$, and the time to produce Z cut by a third. The time taken to produce Y is unchanged.
vi. Use matrix (array) technques to determine the COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS for the Second Order.
vii. Determine the HOURS nreded to produce the SECOND ORDER.

For the FIRST QRDER labour costs were 3 units per hour, but had INCREASED $b_{y} 10 \%$ for the SECOND ORDER.
viii. Determine uthether these LABOUR COSTS are greater or smaller than those for the FIRST ORDER.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Solution:} & i. & Matrix Q: & SOLAR
GEM & \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{$\left(\begin{array}{ccc}\text { X } & \mathrm{Y} & 7 \\ 3 & 2 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 3\end{array}\right)$} \\
\hline & ii. & \begin{tabular}{l}
Matrix P: \\
ORDER
\end{tabular} & $$\begin{aligned}
& \text { SOLAR } \\
& (100
\end{aligned}$$ & $$\begin{gathered}
\text { GEM } \\
50)
\end{gathered}$$ & \\
\hline & iii. & $P Q$ is & $$\begin{gathered}
X \\
(400
\end{gathered}$$ & $$\begin{aligned}
& Y \\
& 200
\end{aligned}$$ & $$\begin{aligned}
& Z \\
& 150)
\end{aligned}$$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

This means that the ORDER requires 400 of $\mathrm{X}, 200$ of Y and 150 of Z .
iv. $R$ is a $3 \times 1$ matrix.
v. $\quad \mathrm{PQR}$ is a $1 \times 1$ matrix (1450)

This means that the order will require 1450 hours To produce (i.e. total time required to produce all $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z components to fulfil the order).
vi. A second order requires
$(50100)\left(\begin{array}{lll}3 & 2 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 3\end{array}\right)=(350100300)$
Hence it requires 350 of $\mathrm{X}, 100$ of Y and 300 f Z .
vii. Hours to produce the second order is ziven by:
$(350100300)\left(\begin{array}{c}1.6 \\ 1 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$
i.e. $560+100+600=1260$ hours
viii. Cavour costs for first order $=3 \times 1450=4350$

Labour costs for second order $=3.3 \times 126=4158$

Hence the labour costs for the second order are smaller than those for the first order.

\subsection*{9.5 Transformations}

A transformation is an operation which transforms a point or a figure into another point or figure.

\subsection*{9.5.1 Translation}

A translation is a transformation which moves all points in a plane through the same distance in the same direction.
E.g. The triangle ABC has been transformed onto the triangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ by a translation $\binom{3}{2}$ i.e. 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up in the plane of the paper.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-133.jpg?height=629&width=826&top_left_y=770&top_left_x=592)

Point A is mapped onto A' by a $a_{2}^{3}$, denoted by $T$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \binom{x}{y}+51 \\
\Rightarrow \quad\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{array}\right)+\binom{3}{y^{\prime}} & =\binom{4}{3}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{9.5.2 Enlargement (E)}

An enlargement with centre O , scale factor k is a transformation which enlarges a given figure by k times the original size.

If $\mathrm{k}>\mathrm{O}$, the given figure and its image are on the same side of the centre of enlargement O .

If $\mathrm{k}<\mathrm{O}$, the given figure and its image are on opposite sides of O .

The figure and its image after an enlargement are similar. The scale factor
$$\mathrm{k}=\frac{\mathrm{OA}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{OA}}=\frac{\mathrm{OB}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{OB}}=\frac{\mathrm{OC}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{OC}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-134.jpg?height=374&width=893&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=684)

Under an enlargement, $\frac{\text { Area of Image }}{\text { Area of Figure }}=\mathrm{k}^{2}$

If the image of a point ( $x, y$ ) under a transformation is the point itself i.e. ( $x, y$ ), the point $(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})$ is called an invariant point of the transformation.

If a line is mapped onto itself under a transformetion, the line is said to be an invariant line under the transformation.

\subsection*{9.5.3 Reflection}

A reflection is a transformation whici reflects all points of a plane in a line (on the plane) called the mirror line.

DABC is mapped onto $\mathrm{D} A^{\prime} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ under a reflection in the line XY which is the perpendicular bisector of $A^{\prime} \mathrm{BB}^{\prime}$ or $\mathrm{CC}^{\prime}$.

Under a reflection, the figure and its image are congruent.

\section*{Example:}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-134.jpg?height=529&width=774&top_left_y=1808&top_left_x=732)

\subsection*{9.5.4 Rotation (R)}

A rotation is a transformation which rotates all points on a plane about a fixed point known as the centre of rotation, through a given angle in anti-clockwise of clockwise direction.

The angle through which the points are rotated is called the angle of rotation.
The triangle ABC is rotated about the origin O through $90^{\circ}$ in the anti-clockwise direction, and mapped onto triangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-135.jpg?height=549&width=723&top_left_y=499&top_left_x=752)

$\Delta \mathrm{OBC}$ is mapped onto $\Delta \mathrm{OB}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ under a shear along the x -axis with factor k .
$$\mathrm{k}=\frac{\mathrm{OC}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{OC}}=\frac{6}{3}=2$$

A shear parallel to the y -axis is a transformation which moves a point ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) parallel to the y -axis through a distance kx where k is the shear factor.
$$\mathrm{k}=\frac{\text { difference in } \mathrm{y} \text { - coordinates of corresponding points }}{\mathrm{x} \text { - coordinate of original point }}$$

\subsection*{9.5.6 Stretching (S)}

One-way stretch.
- A stretch parallel to the $x$-axis is a transformation which move a point ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) parallel to the x -axis, through a distance kx , where k is the stretch factor.
- A stretch parallel to the y-axis is a transforration which moves a point ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) parallel to the y -axis through a disteree ky, where k is the stretch factor.
$\mathrm{k}=\frac{\text { difference in } \mathrm{x} \text {-coordinates of corresponding points }}{\mathrm{y} \text {-coortinate of original point }}$
i. In the case of $s$ retcing parallel to the $x$-axis, the invariant line is the x -axis.
ii. In the cas of stretching parallel to the $y$-axis, the invariant line is the $y$-axs.

\section*{Two Way Stretch}

If a figure is stretched parallel to the $x$-axis as well as parallel to the $y$-axis, then the stretch is called a two-way stretch.

Under a two-way stretch with h and k as constants of stretch parallel to the x -axis and y -axis respectively a point ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) is mapped onto ( $\mathrm{hx}, \mathrm{ky}$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-137.jpg?height=586&width=515&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=913)

Example: Matrix $\left(\begin{array}{rr}1 & 3 \\ 2 & -5\end{array}\right)$ represents a transformation T.

Given ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) is the image of the point ( $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$ ) under the transformation T , find x and y in cras of a and b .

Solution: Write the ordered pairs, (a) and ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$ ) as column vectors:
$\binom{a}{b}$ and $\binom{x}{y}$.
Premultinly $\binom{a}{b}$ by the matrix $\left(\begin{array}{rr}1 & 3 \\ 2 & -5\end{array}\right)$, we get
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\left(\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 3 \\
2 & -5
\end{array}\right)\binom{a}{b} \\
& =\binom{1 \times a+3 \times b}{2 x a+(-5) x b} \\
& =\binom{a+3 b}{2 a-5 b}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $\mathrm{x}=\mathrm{a}+3 \mathrm{~b}, \mathrm{y}=2 \mathrm{a}-5 \mathrm{~b}$
The matrix $\left(\begin{array}{rr}1 & 3 \\ 2 & -5\end{array}\right)$ defines a transformation $T$ which maps the point $(a, b)$ onto $(a+3 b, 2 a-5 b)$.

Example: Find the co-ordinates of the image of the point $(-3,2)$ under the transformation represented by the matrix $\left(\begin{array}{rr}3 & -1 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right)$.

Solution: $\quad$ Let the image of the point $=(x, y)$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\binom{x}{y} & =\left(\begin{array}{rr}
3 & -1 \\
5 & 0
\end{array}\right)\binom{-3}{2} \\
& =\binom{3 \times(-3)+(-1) \times 2}{5 \times(-3)+0 \times 2} \\
& =\binom{-9-2}{-15+0}=\binom{-11}{-15}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore the image of the point $=(-11,-15)$
Example: Find the matrix of the transformation which maps $(1,0)$ onto $(4,1)$ and $(0,1)$ onto $(3,2)$.

Solution: $\quad$ Let the matrix of transformation $=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$
$(1,0) \rightarrow(4,1)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \binom{4}{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}\right)\binom{1}{0} \text { becouse }(4,1) \text { is the image of }(1,0) \\
& \binom{4}{1}=\binom{a+0}{c}
\end{aligned}$$

Tinerefore $\mathrm{a}=4, \mathrm{c}=1$

\section*{Points to Remember}

Definition of a matrix.
- A matrix is a rectangle array of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

Order of matrix.
- A matrix is said to be of order $m^{*} n$ if it has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

Algebra of matrix.
- Addition/subtraction.

This can be carried out provided the matrices are of the same order. The resultant matrix will have the same order as well.
- Scalar product.

A matrix can be multiplied by a constant (scalar).
Each element in the matrix will be multipied by that constant.
- Product of matrices.

This can be done provided the number of columns of the first matrix corresponds to number of rows $f$ fune second matrix.
If $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{A} * \mathrm{~B}$

Let $\quad a_{i, j}$ denote he element in matrix A, $\mathrm{b}_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{n}}$ deate the element in matrix B ,
and $\quad \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{q}}$ denute the element in matrix C , where ( $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$, (m, n) and ( $\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{q}$ ) denote the row and column number respectively.

The (1) $C_{p, q}=\sum_{r=1}^{N} a_{p, r} * b_{r, q}$
where $\mathrm{N}=$ number of columns in matrix A
$$=\text { number of rows in matrix } B$$

For example,
$C_{3,2}=a_{3,1} b_{1,2}+a_{3,2} b_{2,2}+a_{3,3} b_{3,2}+\ldots+a_{3, N} b_{N, 2}$

Chapter 10 : Representation Of Instruction
}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
* understand instruction word format;
* describe the differences between addressing techniques;
* have an understanding of instruction types.

\subsection*{10.1 Introduction}

The principles of architecture extend through almot every aspect of computer organisation. Included are the lengths of the (In ctruction words, whether or not length is variable, and how many addresses ;iin memory are referenced by an instruction word.

Other architectural considerations ©acein the number of bits in each memory word, whether numbers are handied in 1's or 2's complement form or in BCD or some combination of these. What are the instructions provided, how are the memories organised, and hoy are input/output devices interfaced? As can be seen, computer architect iry is a large and rich subject that deals with most aspects of computer design and organisation.

\subsection*{10.2 Construciten of an Instruction Word}

A computer word is an ordered set of characters handled as a group. Basically all words consist of a set of binary digits, and the meaning of the digits depends on several factors. For instance, the bits 01000100 could represent the decimal number 68 in a pure binary computer, and the decimal number 44 in a BCD computer that uses an $8,4,2,1$ code. Thus, the meaning of a set of digits is determined by its usage.

Other interpretations are possible, for instruction words are stored just as data words are, and the digits could represent an instruction to the computer. Since memory locations can store either instruction words or data words, the programmers and system operators must see that the instruction words are used to determine the sequence of operations that the computer performs, and that the computer performs, and that reasonable meanings are assigned to the words.

\subsection*{10.3 Instruction Word Formats}

\subsection*{10.3.1 Numbers of Addresses}

The number of divisions in the basic instruction word is determined primarily by the number of addresses referred to. The single-address instruction has been covered. Most current computers however, have two-address instruction words with three sections; the first section consists of the op code and the second and third sections generally each contain the address of an operand. Different computers used addresses differently.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Operation Code & Address of operand \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{ Single-address instruction } \\
\hline Operation Code & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Address of \\
operand (A)
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Address of \\
operand (B)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

In many computers, instead of a single accumulator, there are two or more registers called either multiple or general-purpose registers, or simple general registers. Instruction words with two addresses can operate in one of the following modes:

Memory, memory. Both addresses refer to memory locations. For two memory address A and B, the instruction ADD A, B would cause the operation.
$$M E M[A] \leftarrow M E M[A]+M E M[B]$$

Note: MEM[A] means "The contents o a datess A in memory".
Example: Add the numbers in memery 10 cations 963 and 492, and store into memory location $9 € 3$.
\begin{tabular}{|cc|c|}
\hline Add & 963 & 492 \\
\hline MEM & MEM \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

General register, memery. Address $A$ in the instruction word specifies the general register to de ised, and the second address indicated the location in memory. A LCAD ACCUMULATOR instruction (LOAD A, B) would cause the corionts at location B in memory to be transferred into the general register $d$-neted A. In symbols, $\boldsymbol{G R}_{A} \leftarrow \operatorname{MEM}[B]$.

Examule. Add the number at memory location 492 into the operand in $\mathrm{GR}_{3}$ and store into $\mathrm{GR}_{3}$.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Add & 3 & 492 \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ GR } & MEM \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Memory, general register. The memory address A gives the location of the operand in memory, and the general register code B is the register involved. An instruction might be a STORE instruction (STO A, B), which would move the contents of the general register into memory: $\boldsymbol{M E M}[A] \leftarrow \boldsymbol{G} \boldsymbol{R}_{\boldsymbol{B}}$.
Example: Add the value in GR4 into the value address at 1738 and store into address 1738.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Add & 1738 & 4 \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ MEM } & GR \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{10.4 Representation of Instruction and Data}

Important features of a computer's architecture are the number of bits in instruction words, the size of memory words, and the way data is represented in the computer.

Business data processing involves much manipulation involving character strings (names, addresses, text, etc.). The desire to create computer architectures that conserve on instruction word length and also permit efficient storage of character strings of arbitrary length has led to a number of computer architectures with:
only 8 bits at each address in memory, so that a single alphanumeric character an be stored at each address, and
instruction words with variable lengths (each word length is some multiple of 8 bits).

As a result, most computers now have memories where addresses are 8-bits bytes. Instruction words are variable length, with each being some multiple of 8 bits. Data words are also multiples of 8 bits, with many compu ers having 8-, 16-, 32-, and even 64-bit data word lengths.

\subsection*{10.5 Addressing Techniques}

There are several techniques used to $5^{\circ}$ c fy a memory address. The use of any of these techniques is generally moty ate by one of the following considerations:

Desire to shorten address section
Programmer convenience
System operation facitites
The basic addressing techniques now in use: direct addressing, indirect addressing and indexed addressing.

\subsection*{10.5.1 Direct Addressing}

By simply giving the complete binary memory address is the most direct way to locate an operand or to jump. As a result, most computers provide for some form of direct addressing.

Example: MOV AX, TABLE
This instruction loads the contents of data memory location TABLE into the AX register.

\subsection*{10.5.2 Indirect Addressing}

Another widely used addressing variation is called indirect addressing where the instruction word gives the address not of the operand to be used, but the address of the address of the operand.

For example, if we ADD 302 and the instruction is a conventional directaddressing instruction, the number at location 302 will be added to the word currently in the accumulator. If the addition instruction is indirectly addressed, and we write IAD 302 (indirect ADD), then the number stored at address 302 will give the address of the operand to be used. As an example, when the instruction word at address 5 in the following memory is performed, it will cause the number 164 to be added to the current contents of the accumulator.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Memory 5 : : 302 : : 49 5 & $$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Contents IAD } \\
& 302:: 495: 164
\end{aligned}$$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{10.5.3 Indexed Addressing}

There is a variation on conventional direct memory addressing that facilities programming, particularly the programming of instruction sequences that are to be repeated many times on a set of data distributed throughout the machine. This technique is called indexing.

\subsection*{10.6 Instruction Types}

The instruction set can be classified undei 4 main groups:

Data Transfer
Arithmetic
Control Transfer
String Instructions

\subsection*{10.6.1 Data Transier Instructions}

Data transite instructions move data and addresses between register and a memory location or I/O ports.

Example: Move [MOV]
The general form is: MOV destination, source
The fundamental general-purpose instruction is move[MOV]. It can transfer byte or word data between register and a memory location or between two registers. The source can also be a numeric value. It can also transfer an immediate data value into a register or memory location.

However, the following must be noted:
data cannot be moved between two memory locations directly.
cannot load an immediate value. E.g. load the offset address of a segment into a segment register.

\subsection*{10.6.2 Arithmetic Instructions}

These instructions perform arithmetic operations on binary or BCD numbers. Three are instructions for the four standard arithmetic functions namely:
addition
subtraction
multiplication
division
logical

\subsection*{10.6.3 Control Transfer}

These are instructions that can transfer program execution from one part of memory to another. These instructions can be divided into 3 groups:

Unconditional transfers
Conditional transfers
Iteration controls

\subsection*{10.6.3.1 Unconditional Transfers}

It is generally used to skip over grove of instructions that executed from some other part of the program.

Example: Call Procedure-nain?

\subsection*{10.6.3.2 Contitional Transfer}

In the condition Transfer instructions, if the condition is satisfied, the instrution will be executed, otherwise it will continue on to the next instruction in the program.
All conditional transfer instructions occupy two bytes in memory. The first byte holds the operations code and the second bytes holds the relative displacement.

\subsection*{10.6.3.3 Iteration Controls}

The general form is LOOP target.
The iteration control instructions are conditional transfer, but have a very special purpose. They set up repetitive loops.

\subsection*{10.6.4 String Instructions}

The string instructions enable us to operate on blocks of bytes or words in memory. These blocks, or strings, may be up to 64 K bytes long, and may consist of numeric values (either binary or BCD), alphanumeric values (such as ASCII text characters) or, for that matter, any kind of information that can be stored in memory as binary patterns.

\subsection*{10.7 Exercises}

Briefly describe what is direct, indirect and indexed addressing.

Describe the difference between direct and indirect addressing.
Briefly describe three instruction types.

\section*{Chapter 11 : Errors And Accuracy}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
* identify different types of errors;
* calculate absolute and relative error;
* estimate maximum absolute error;
* generate check digit.

\subsection*{11.1 Introduction}

In building a system, measures must be takel ázainst possible human mistakes. Procedures must be set up to help people to delect any mistakes. The role of data preparation or data entry are pron to errors, therefore they must not be overlooked as the ill effect may affect the entire system seriously.

\subsection*{11.2 Mistakes}

At the man/machine infa- interface, i.e. when a person wants to enter data into a computer system, te common mistakes are:

Lose track of tiee source documents.
Enter data wrongly.
Invalid datatype.
e.g. enter alphabets instead of numeric data.

Out of the valid data range.
e.g. enter 102 while the valid range is 1 to 100 .

Transposition of characters.
e.g. enter 23322 while the actual data is 23223 .

Interference in data transmission from a remote site.
e.g. 00100101 is transmitted along a cable and on the way due to voltage surge, the data becomes 10100101 .
and many more.

Mistakes are due to human carelessness.
Parity bit check.

\section*{Example:}

If ' $B$ ' is represented as 1000010 , we can use even parity conversion to produce a parity bit.
\begin{tabular}{lcc} 
IF odd number of 1's THEN & \\
parity bit & $\leftarrow$ & 1 \\
ELSE & & \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{ parity bit } & $\leftarrow$
\end{tabular}

The parity bit may be appended to the left of the 1000010 , ' $B$ ' is represented as 01000010 . Suppose the data is received as 01100010 , there are three 1 's which should give 1 in the parity bit, then the mistake is detected.

Check digit method.
- A Check digit is derived from the true data before transmission, which is then appended to the right of the true data for validation.

Step 1: $\quad$ A true data 445, each of the diriis is assigned a weight,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-157.jpg?height=332&width=703&top_left_y=1184&top_left_x=856)

Step 2: Tin ram of 38 is to be divided by a modulus.
It this example, 11 is used as it can detect most of the mistakes).

38/11 gives quotient 3 and the remainder 5 .
Sup 3: $\quad$ Remainder 5 is subtracted from the modulus (11) to obtain the check digit ' 6 '.
$11-5=6$

Step 4: $\quad$ The check digit can be appended to the right of 445, to give 4456, which could be validated.

In order to verify the correctness of 4456 , we could just multiply 4456 by the set of weight, 6 is assigned the weight of 1 ,
\begin{tabular}{llll}
4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
4 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
$(4 * 4)$ & $+\left(4^{*} 3\right)$ & $+\left(5^{*} 2\right)$ & $+(6 * 1)=44$
\end{tabular}

44 is divisible by 11 , thus conclude that 4456 is received correctly.
It has been tested that MOD 11 is most efficient in detecting mistakes, reason being 11 is a prime number. Though bigger number is better, the
small increase in efficiency is overwhelmed by large increase in processing.

\section*{Check point}

List five types of mistakes which may occur during the data preparation and data entry stages of the processing cycle.

Give one other example each of the appropriate use of the hash and batch totals. Describe the principle of a parity check and how even and odd parity differ.

Using mod 7 and weighting 2,3,4,5..., append appropriate check digits to:
v. 439
W. 1058535

Using the same mod 7, determine whether the following are valid:
x. 1794
y. 10545722

\subsection*{11.3 Errors}

\subsection*{11.3.1 Inherent Error}

It is error that already exist by itse!f in the measurement scale. E.g. Take a ruler of measurement, though there are many small divisions, there is still the smallest division that is not sub-divided further. Thus there is uncertainty in reading the length as mentioned above.

If the length fall between 5.1 cm and 5.2 cm , the smallest division is 0.1 cm , then the reported readirg may be 5.15 cm and the inherent error is 0.05 cm .

\subsection*{11.3.2 Induced Error}

It is the error which is brought in from 'outside' due to external factors.
Example: In a fixed point 8-bit register in computer, the implied point is to the right of 5 bits.

If a data 1010.01110 is to be stored, rounding or truncation is necessary.
Rounding the above data is stored as
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus the error is brought in due to the limitation of computer.

\section*{Check point}

What is the difference between error and mistakes?

\subsection*{11.4 Measurement of Error}

\section*{Absolute error}
- If a true value 2.5 is reported to be 3 (round to full number) an error of 0.5 is induced. This error is called the absolute error.
- Absolute error
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}=\mid$ reported value - true value $\mid$
| | means the absolute value is taken, the sign is not considered at all.

\section*{Relative error}
- Another more meaningful measurement of error is relative error, because it expresses the absolute error as a proportion of the true value (if the true value is not available, the reported value is used.)
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}} & =\quad \mid \text { absolute error } / \text { True Value } \mid \\
& =\quad \mid \text { absolute errer } \text { Rrue Value } \mid * 100 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Maximum relative error between any TWE values reported as
$$\mathrm{R}=100 * \text { (enor bound } / \mathrm{R} \text { ) }$$

Example: $\quad 3.6$ is rounded (10 1D, the Maximum error between 3.55 and $3.05=100 *(0.1 / 3.6)=2.78 \%$

Check point
What is the error bound of the value eported as:
a. $\quad 3.5 \mathrm{~cm}$
z. 45.3 serconis

Calculate the maxirum relative error on:
aa. 13.5
bb. 130.5
cc. 1300.5

\subsection*{11.5 Error Propagation}

Inherent errors in data values, may produce further errors as they are operated on arithmetically, these errors may be termed as Induced errors. This spread of errors is called the Error Propagation.

\section*{Addition}

Example: 5+7, each of the data values are rounded to whole number.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 5.5+7.5=13 \\
& 4.5+6.5=11 \\
& \\
& E_{r}=100 *(1 / 12)=8.33 \% \\
& E_{r} \text { of } 5=10 \% \\
& E_{r} \text { of } 7=7.1 \%
\end{aligned}$$

You may try $13+6$, a conclusion may be derived.
Conclusion: Relative error of the sum is between the relative error of the individual reported values.
$$\begin{aligned}
& E_{a}=\text { absolute error of } \\
& E_{a}(A+B)=E_{a}(A)+E_{a}(B)
\end{aligned}$$

Subtraction
Example: 8-4, each rounded to whole numl or.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 8.5-3.5=5 \\
& 7.5-4.5=3 \\
& \left.\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(8-4)=1-\mathrm{M}=13\right)+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(4) \\
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}=100 *(1 / 4)=25 \% \\
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}} \text { of } 8=100 *(0.5 / 8)=6.25 \% \\
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}} \text { of } 4=100 *(0.5 / 4)=12.5 \%
\end{aligned}$$

You may try 3-2

Conclusi n: Relative error of the subtraction is more than the relative error of the individual reported values.
$$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{B})=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{~A})+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{~B})$$

Multiplication
Example: $\quad 3 * 4 * 5$, each rounded to whole number. $3 * 4 * 5=60$, $3.5 * 4.5 * 5.5=86.625, \quad$ Max $2.5 * 3.5 * 4.5=39.375, \quad$ Min

Error bound $=86.625-39.375=47.25$
This error bound is very big indeed, and it is not symmetrical about 60 (the result of multiplying 3,4 and 5). If we quantify the relative error, it would be as follow:

Take half of the error bound,
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}=100 *(23.625 / 60)=39.375 \%$
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}$ of $3=100 *(0.5 / 3)=16.667 \%$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}} \text { of } 4=100 *(0.5 / 4)=12.5 \% \\
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}} \text { of } 5=100 *(0.5 / 5)=10 \%
\end{aligned}$$

You may try $3 * 3 * 3$, what conclusion you may draw?
Conclusion: Relative error of the multiplication is approximately the sum of the relative errors of the individual reported values.
$$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}\left(\mathrm{~A} * \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{C}\right)=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{~A}) / \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{~B}) / \mathrm{B}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{C}) / \mathrm{C}$$

Induced error in multiplication is the sum of the inherent error in each reported value.

\section*{Division}

Example: 7.5/5.3, each is rounded to 1D
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$7.55 / 5.25=1.438$, & \\
7.45/5.35 $=1.393$, & \\
Min
\end{tabular}

Error bound $=1.438-1.393=0.045$
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}=0.045 / 2=0.0225$
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}$ of $(7.5 / 5.3)=100 *(0.52 \mathrm{~s} / 1.415)=1.59 \%$
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}$ of $7.5=100$ * $(0.05 / 7.5)=0.667 \%$
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}$ of $5.3=100 *(0.55 / 5.3)=0.943 \%$
Try 3.5/1.5
Conclusion: Relative tror of the division is approximately the sum of the relative erors of individual reported values.
$\left.\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{D}} \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{B}\right)=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A}) / \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{B}) / \mathrm{B}$
Finally, ty a combination of arithmetic operation, multiplying and division.
Exampie: $\quad\left(3.5 * 13.5^{*} 1.5\right) /(7.0 * 4.5 * 40.5)$
In what ways the error propagated is maximised?
Multiply the top row and bottom row respectively, then divide the numerator by the denominator.

In what ways the error may be minimised?
(3.5/7.0) * (13.5/4.5) * (1.5/40.5), the individual divisions will produce values which are relatively small, overflow error may be reduced.

\section*{Rounding}
- Rounding errors frequently occur when doing manual decimal arithmetic. They occur with even greater frequency in computer arithmetic.

Example: If 0.0056 is rounded to 3 decimal places the answer is 0.006 .
A rounding error of $0.006-0.0056=0.0004$ is therefore induced.

If 0.0055 is rounded to 3 decimal places, we may use the following rule:

If the third decimal place is odd, do nothing;
else add 1 to the third decimal place.
0.0055 is rounded to 0.005 .

If 0.0045 is rounded to 3 decimal places, the reported value is 0.005 .

\section*{Truncation}
- If a storage space that can only accommodate 4 digits is used to store a number 67890, the least signification digit ' 0 ' will be chopped off giving 6789 as the number stored.
- If 1010.0010111 is to be stored in 12-bit register with 4 bits to the right of the implied point. The stored data will be
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-162.jpg?height=161&width=1140&top_left_y=1024&top_left_x=635)

Implied point

\section*{Overflow}
- Overflow is different from tration error in that the most signification digit will be drop-out ins ea the least significant. Storing 67890 in 4 digits, the most signif can digit ' 6 ' is chopped off.
- This error is ve serious in computer programming, thus many compilers and interpreters are written such that they can deliver 'overflow error' nessage.

\section*{Significant figures}
- Aitimes, we can only take a certain number of significant figures. Take to: example the population of Singapore, we may say there are 3,500,000 people taking only 2 significant figures. Even though we may have found the population to be $3,547,893$, as the less significant digits 47,893 is small compared to $3,500,000$.
- A real number 2.03452355 may be expressed in 5 significant figures, as 2.0345 .

Converting from one number system to another
- To convert 0.7 decimal to binary number will induce an error as shown below:
\begin{tabular}{rll}
.7 & $*$ & 2 \\
1.4 & $*$ & 2 \\
0.8 & $*$ & 2 \\
1.6 & $*$ & 2 \\
1.2 & $*$ & 2 \\
0.4 & $*$ & 2 \\
$0.8 \ldots$ & &
\end{tabular}

The series of multiplication is recurring, if we to stop at 7 binary places, we have to accept that an error is induced.
$$0.7=(0.1011001)_{2}$$

Rounding, truncation, overflow, significant figures and change of number system will all lead to induced errors in data.

\section*{Check point}

What is the effect on error if $3.5 * 7.25$ is:
dd. Calculated to integer precision;
ee. Cut to 1D;
ff. Rounded to 1D;
gg. Calculated to 3 significant figures;
hh. Worked out 'in full', with no cut or rounding.

\subsection*{11.6 To Control Errors}

We want to calculate the volume of a sphere of radius 5.5 cm , the formula below can be used:
$$\mathrm{V}=(4 / 3) * \pi \mathrm{r} 3$$

Take $\pi=3.1-1$, and $r=5.5$
\begin{tabular}{llll} 
& 5.5, & $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}$ & Inherent \\
r & $5.5,5$ & $0.91 \%$ & Induced
\end{tabular}

This means the $V$ has an absolute error of $(2.73 / 100) * 696.7785=19.02$.
This means that range of Volume is $696 \pm 19$ cubic centimetres.
The decimal places are not significant.
To reduce the induced error, we should, if possible, take ' $r$ ' to 5 D and do the same for $p$. Raise ' $r$ ' to the third power, multiply by $n$, multiply by 4 and finally divide by 3 . Only by taking such precautions, could we minimise the errors.

\section*{Answers to check points}

Mistakes are made due to human carelessness in handling data. Errors arise from the data itself, i.e. Inherent error; it may be brought in due to external factors like rounding, limit of computer systems, i.e. Induced error.

\section*{Points to Remember}

To distinguish mistake from error.
To be aware of how to reduce mistakes.
The methods are hash total, batch total, parity-bit method and check digit method.

Inherent error.
- It is error that exist by itself in the measurement scale.

Induced error.
- It is error that is brought in from 'outside' by external factors. Usually, induced error is the result of propagation of inherent errors.

To measure error using two quantities.
- Absolute error $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}=$ 'reported value - true value'
- Relative error $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}$ True value

Error can spread, or propagate.
- $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B})=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A})+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{B})$

As a result of addition, the ©absolute error of $(\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B})$ is the sum of absolute error of A and nat of B.
- $\quad \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B})=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A})+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{B})$
- $\quad \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}\left(\mathrm{A} * \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{C}\right)=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{A})\left(\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{B}) / \mathrm{B}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{C}) / \mathrm{C}\right.$
- $\quad \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{r}}(\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{B})=\mathrm{E}\left(\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{Z} / \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{a}}(\mathrm{B}) / \mathrm{B}\right.$

Types of errors.
- Rourding; Truncation; Overflow; Conversion

Divide a number by another, before multiplying them, is a method to reduce possible overflow error.

\section*{Chapter 12 : Statistics}

\section*{Chapter Objectives}

At the completion of this chapter, you would have learnt:
* to understand why statistics are used to solve real life problem;
* to use general guidelines to organise data into Frequency Table;
* to use various charts and graph to display data, e.g. Histogram Cumulative Frequency Diagram;
* to calculate Standard Deviation, Variance as measures of central tendency;
* to calculate Standard Deviation, Variance as measures of spread or dispersion.

\subsection*{12.1 Introduction}

An addition to our ordinary; Booie an agebra, De Morgan's Laws is one tool used for simplifying complex expressions in Boolean algebra or complex switching circuits.

Process that entails des rysen of products if physical testing is carried.
- E.g. To cmistantiate the life span of light bulbs from a factory.

Situations are teo large and too complicated if physically counting were carried out.
- E.g. The number of people suffering from AIDS in Asia.

Situations where forecast or predictions are to be made based on past information.
- E.g. The weather forecasting.

Statistics involve the process of collecting data from a sample, make appropriate deductions from the sample. In this chapter, we will look at now to organise data into frequency table, display data in proper charts and calculate relevant quantities.

\subsection*{12.2 Raw Data}

Raw data, once collected has to be organised numerically. An example is the set of names of male students obtained from an alphabetical listing of a public school records.

\subsection*{12.2.1 Arrays}

An array is an arrangement of raw numerical data in ascending or descending order of magnitude. The difference between the largest and smallest numbers is called the range of the data. For example, if the heaviest weight of 100 male students is 74 kg and the lightest weight is 60 kg , then the range is $74-60$ which gives 14 kg .

\subsection*{12.3 Grouped Data}

\subsection*{12.3.1 Frequency Distributions}

When summarising large masses of raw data it is often useful to distribute the data into classes or categories and to determine the number of individuals belonging to each class, called the class frequency. A tabular arrangement of these data by classes together with the corresponding class frequencies is called a frequency distribution or frequency table. The table below shows a frequency distribution of weights (recorded to the nearest kg ) $2 \times 100$ male students at Informatics Computer School.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Mass (Kilogram) & \\
\hline $60-62$ & \\
\hline $63-65$ & \\
\hline $66-68$ & \\
\hline $69-71$ & 42 \\
\hline $72-74$ & 27 \\
\hline 2 & 8 \\
\hline & Total $=100$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The first class, for example, consists of weights from 60 to 62 kg . Since 5 students have weights falling between this class, the corresponding class frequency is 5 .

Data organised and summarised as in the above frequency distribution are often called grouped data.

\subsection*{12.3.2 Class Intervals and Class Limits}

A range of values defining a class such as $60-62$ in the above table is called a class interval. The end numbers, 60 and 62 , are called class limits. The smallest number 60 is the lower limit and the larger number 62 is the upper class limit.

\subsection*{12.3.3 Class Boundaries}

If weights are recorded to the nearest kg , the class interval 60-62 theoretically includes all measurements from 59.5 kg to 62.5 kg . These numbers, indicated briefly by the exact numbers 59.5 and 62.5 , are called class boundaries or true class limits. The smaller number 59.5 is the lower class boundary and the larger number 62.5 is the upper class boundary.

Sometimes, class boundaries are used to symbolise classes. For example, the various classes in the first column of the previous table could be indicated by 59.5-62.5, 62.5-65.5, etc.

\subsection*{12.3.4 The Size of a Class Interval}

The size of a class interval is the difference between the lower and the upper class boundaries and is also referred to as the class width, class size or class strength. For instance, the class interval for the above example is 62.5-59.5 $=3$.

\subsection*{12.3.5 The Class Mark}

The class mark is the midpoint of the class interval and is obtained by adding the lower and upper class limits and dividing by two. Thus the class mark of the interval $60-62$ is $\frac{(60+62)}{2}=61$. The class mark is also known as the class midpoint.

General rules for forming frequency distributions:
- Determine the largest and smallest rambers in the raw data and thus find the range.
- Divide the range into a convenient number of class intervals having the same size.
- Determine the number of obervations falling into each class interval.

\subsection*{12.4 Presentation of Statistical Data}

A graph is a pictorial representation of the relationship between variables. Many types of graphs $m^{\circ}$ omployed in statistics, depending on the nature of the data involved and the rarpose for which the graphs are intended. Among these are bar graphs, pie giqphs, pictographs, etc. These graphs are sometimes referred to as charts or diagrams.

\subsection*{12.4.1 Histogram and Frequency Polygons}

There are two graphical representations of frequency distributions.
A histogram of a frequency distribution consists of a set of rectangles having
- Bases on a horizontal axis with centres at the class marks and lengths equal to the class interval sizes; and
- Areas proportional to class frequencies.

A frequency polygon corresponding to the above frequencies plotted against class marks. It can be obtained by connecting midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in the histogram.

The histogram and frequency polygon corresponding to the above frequency distribution of weights are shown on the same set of axes in the graph below. It is necessary to add the extensions PQ and RS to the next lower and higher-class marks which have corresponding class frequency of zero.

\subsection*{12.4.2 Cumulative Frequency Distributions}

The total frequency of all values less than the upper class boundary of a given class interval is called the cumulative frequency up to and including the class interval. For example, the cumulative frequency up to and including the class interval $66-68$ is $5+18+42=65$, signifying that altogether 65 students have weights less than 68.5 kg .

A graph showing the cumulative frequency less than any upper class boundary plotted against the upper class boundary is called a cumulative frequency polygon. (Ogive)

\subsection*{12.5 Three Statistical Quantities of Central Tendency}

\subsection*{12.5.1 The Arithmetic Mean}

The arithmetic mean or the mean of a set of n numbers $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, \ldots, X_{N}$ is denoted by X and is defined as
$$\bar{X}=\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}+\ldots+X_{N}}{N}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} X_{j}}{N}=\frac{\sum X}{N}$$

\section*{Example:}

The arithmetic mean of the numbers $8,3,5,12,10$ is
$$\bar{X}=\frac{8+3+5+12+10}{5}=\frac{38}{5}=7.6$$

If the numbers $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{N}$ occur $f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{N}$ tir.es respectively the arithmetic mean is given by:
$$X=\frac{f_{1} X_{1}+f_{2} X_{2}+f_{3} X}{f_{1}+f_{2}+.+f_{N}}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j} X_{j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j}}=\frac{\sum f X}{\sum f}$$

\section*{Example:}

The arithmetic mean the numbers $5,8,6$ and 2 which occurs $3,2,4$ and 1 time respectively is:
$$X=\frac{(3)(5)+(2)(8)+(4)(6)+(1)(2)}{3+2+4+1}=\frac{15+16+24+2}{10}=5.7$$

\subsection*{12.5.2 The Median}

The median of a set of numbers arranged in order of magnitude (i.e. in an array) is the middle value or the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.

\section*{Example:}

The set of numbers $3,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,10$ has a median of 6 .

\section*{Example:}

The set of numbers $5,5,7,9,11,12,15,18$ has a median $=\frac{1}{2}(9+11)=10$.
For a grouped data, the median, obtained by interpolation is given by

Median $=\mathrm{L}_{1}+\left(\frac{\frac{\mathrm{N}}{2}-\left(\sum \mathrm{f}\right)_{1}}{\mathrm{f}_{\text {median }}}\right) \mathrm{x} \mathrm{c}$
where
$\mathrm{L}_{1} \quad=$ Lower class boundary of the median class (i.e. the class containing the median).
$\mathrm{N}=$ Number of items in the data (i.e. total frequency).
$(\Sigma \mathrm{f})_{1}=$ Sum of frequencies of all classes lower than the median class.
$\mathrm{f}_{\text {median }}=$ Frequency of median class.
c $\quad=$ Size of median class inteval.

Median of grouped data may also be obtained graphically using cumulative Frequency Diagram.

\section*{Example:}

By first creating a cumurative frequency table and then a cumulative frequency diagram, estimate the nedian of the following survey of the examination marks of 80 students on a paricular computer course.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Marks (\%) & No. of students \\
\hline $0-20$ & 3 \\
\hline $21-40$ & 19 \\
\hline $41-60$ & 35 \\
\hline $61-80$ & 22 \\
\hline $81-100$ & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Median is the mark below which $50 \%$ of the students' score, and therefore above which another $50 \%$ of the student score.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Marks (less than or =) & Cumulative Frequency \\
\hline 20 & 3 \\
\hline 40 & 22 \\
\hline 60 & 57 \\
\hline 80 & 79 \\
\hline 100 & 80 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Cumulative Frequency Table

Figure 12-1
From the above Figure 12-1, there are 40 students who score 52 marks or less and the other 40 score more than 52 marks. The median is 52 marks.

In Figure 12-1, 39 mark is the lower quartile, which is the mark below which $25 \%$ of the population of students score (or 20 out of 80 ). 61 marks is the upper quartile below which $75 \%$ of the student score, (or 60 out of 80 ). The range of $(61-39)=22$ is the Inter-quartile range.

\subsection*{12.5.3 The Mode}

The mode of a set of number is that value which occurs with the greatest frequency, i.e. it is the most common value. The mode may not exist, and even if it does exist, it may not be unique.

\section*{Example:}

The set $2,2,5,7,9,9,9,10,10,11,12,18$ has a mode $=9$.

\section*{Example:}

The set $3,5,8,10,12,15$, 16 has no mode.
A distribution having only one mode is called uni-modal.
In the case of a grouped data where a frequency curve has been constructed to fit the data, the mode will be the value (values) of X with the highest frequency.

From a frequency distribution or histogram the mode ran be obtained using the following formula.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Mode } \quad=\mathrm{L}_{1}+\left(\frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta_{1}-\Delta_{2}}\right) \times \mathrm{c} \\
& \text { where } \\
& \mathrm{L}_{1} \quad=\text { ewer class boundary of modal class } \\
& \text { (i.e. class containing the mode) } \\
& \Delta_{1}=\text { Excess of modal frequency over frequency of } \\
& \text { previous lower class. } \\
& \Delta_{2} \quad=\text { Excess of modal frequency over frequency of next } \\
& \text { higher class. } \\
& \text { c } \quad=\text { Size of modal class interval. }
\end{aligned}$$

Mode of grouped data may be estimated from Histogram as shown in Figure 121.

\section*{Example:}

Estimate the mode of the following distribution of salaries of employees in a computer company:
\begin{tabular}{|cc|c|}
\hline Salary (\$) & No. of people \\
\hline 4000 & - & 2 \\
\hline 5000 & - & 12 \\
\hline 6000 & - & 19 \\
\hline 7000 & - & 25 \\
\hline 8000 & - & 36 \\
\hline 9000 & - & 17 \\
\hline 10000 & - & 9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
iii. By graphical means; and
jjj. By calculation means.

Figure 12-2 : Histogram

The category 8000-9000 has the highest frequency, it is called the modal class. The estimated mode is in this category (or class). It can be estimated as shown in Figure 12-2.
kkk. Mode can be estimated using the formula.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Mode } & =\mathrm{L}_{1}+\left(\frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta_{1}+\Delta_{2}}\right) \times \mathrm{c} \\
\mathrm{~L} 1 & =8000 \\
\Delta_{1} & =11 \\
\Delta_{2} & =19 \\
\text { c } & =1000 \\
\text { Mode } & =8000+\frac{11}{11+19} \times 1000=8366.67
\end{array}$$

\subsection*{12.6 Dispersion and Variation}

The degree to which numerical data tend to spread adout an average value is called the variation or dispersion of the data. Yarious measures of dispersion or variation are available.

\subsection*{12.6.1 Mean Deviation}

The mean deviation or average deviation of a set of $N$ numbers $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{N}$ is defined by:/*
$$\text { Mean Deviaion }=\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{\mathrm{j}=1}^{\mathrm{N}}\left|X_{j}-\bar{X}\right|}{N}$$

\section*{Example:}

Find the mean deviation of the set of numbers $2,3,6,8,11$.

\section*{Solution:}

Arithmetic Mean $=\bar{X}=\frac{2+3+6+8+11}{5}=6$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Mean Deviation (MD) } & =\frac{|2-6|+|3-6|+|6-6|+|8-6|+|11-6|}{5} \\
& =\frac{|-4|+|-3|+|0|+|2|+|5|}{5} \\
& =\frac{4+3+0+2+5}{5}=2.8
\end{aligned}$$

If $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{K}$ occur with frequencies $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}, \ldots, f_{k}$ respectively, the mean deviation can be written as :

Mean Deviation $=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{K} f_{j}\left|X_{j}-\bar{X}\right|}{N}$
where $N=\sum_{j=1}^{K} f_{j}=\sum \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{j}}$

This form is useful for grouped data where the $X_{j}$ 's represent class marks and the $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{j}}$ 's are the corresponding frequencies.

\subsection*{12.6.2 The Standard Deviation}

The standard deviation of a set of N numbers $\mathrm{X}_{1}, \mathrm{X}_{2}, \ldots, \mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{K}}$ is denoted by SD and is defined by
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} f_{j}\left(X_{j}-\bar{X}\right)^{2}}{N}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X-\bar{X})^{2}}{N}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{\sum X}{N}-\bar{X}^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

If $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{K}$ occur, ith irequencies $f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{K}$ respectively, the standard deviation can be written as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { SD } & =\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K} f_{j}\left(X_{j}-\bar{X}\right)^{2}}{N}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{\sum f(X-\bar{X})^{2}}{N}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{\sum f^{2}}{N}-\bar{X}^{2}} \\
\text { where } N & =\sum_{i=1}^{K} f_{i}=\sum f
\end{aligned}$$

This form is useful for grouped data.

\subsection*{12.6.3 The Variance}

The variance of a set N numbers $\mathrm{X}_{1}, \mathrm{X}_{2}, \ldots, \mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{K}}$ is defined as the square of the standard deviation and is thus given by
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Var } \quad & =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(X_{j}-\bar{X}\right)^{2}}{N} \\
& =\frac{\sum(X-\bar{X})^{2}}{N}-\bar{X}^{2} \\
& =\frac{\sum X^{2}}{N}-\bar{X}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

If $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots$, XK occurs with frequencies $f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{K}$ respectively, the variance can be written as:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_05_01770157832e86793986g-182.jpg?height=181&width=675&top_left_y=1148&top_left_x=613)
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\sum f(X-\bar{x})}{N} \\
& =\frac{\leq-X^{2}}{N}-\bar{X}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\text { where } N=\sum_{i=1}^{K} f_{i}=\sum f$$

This form is useful for grouped data.

\section*{Example:}

Find the standard deviation and variance of the following set of numbers:
$12,6,7,3,15,10,18,5$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Arithmetic mean } & =\bar{X}=\frac{\sum X}{N} \\
& =\frac{12+6+7+3+15+10+18+5}{8} \\
& =\frac{76}{8}=9.5
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{SD} & =\sqrt{\frac{\sum(\mathrm{X}-\overline{\mathrm{X}})^{2}}{\mathrm{~N}}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{(12-9.5)^{2}+(6-9.5)^{2}+(7-9.5)^{2}+(3-9.5)^{2}+(15-9.5)^{2}+(10-9.5)^{2}+(18-9.5)^{2}+(5-9.5)^{2}}{8}} \\
& =\sqrt{23.75} \\
& =4.87 \\
\mathrm{Var} & =(4.872)^{2} \\
& =23.75
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Example:}

Find the standard deviation of the weights of the 100 male students at Informatics Computer School as shown in the table below.

\section*{Points to Remember}

To use some guidelines to organise data into frequency distribution table (grouped data).

Use line graph, bar chart, piotogram, pie chart, histogram and cumulative frequency diagram to display data in graphical form.
Calculate mean, median and mode as measures of central tendency.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline & Raw Data & Grouped Data \\
\hline Mean & $\frac{\sum \mathrm{x}}{\mathrm{N}}$ & $\frac{\sum \mathrm{fx}}{\sum \mathrm{f}}$ \\
\hline Median & Take the middle data from a sorted list. & \begin{tabular}{l}
1. Use cumulative frequency diagram. \\
2. Use formula.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Mode & Take the data that appear most frequency. & \begin{tabular}{l}
1. Use histogram. \\
2. Use formula.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Calculate standard deviation and variunce as measures of spread or dispersion.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Standard \\
Deviation
\end{tabular} & $\sqrt{\frac{\sum \mathrm{x}^{2}}{\mathrm{~N}}-\left(\frac{\sum \mathrm{x}}{\mathrm{N}}\right)^{2}}$ & $\sqrt{\frac{\sum \mathrm{f}(\mathrm{x})^{2}}{\sum \mathrm{f}}-\left(\frac{\sum \mathrm{fx}}{\sum \mathrm{f}}\right)^{2}}$ \\
\hline Variance & $($ Standard Deviation) & $($ Standard Deviation) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Use time series graph to observe the trend of a variable over time.
Use scatter diagram to observe the correlation between two variables.
