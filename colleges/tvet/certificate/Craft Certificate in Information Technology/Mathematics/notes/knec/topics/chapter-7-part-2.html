                        <p>A linked list, or one-way list, is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where the linear order is given by means of pointers. That is, each node is divided into two parts : the first part contains the information of the element, and the second part, called the link field or next pointer field, contains the address of the next node in the list.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example: Linked list with 3 nodes</strong></p>

                        <p>The queue is yet another data structure which differs in a number of ways from the stack. It may be used in real-time processing, for scheduling of jobs in the context of an operating systems or in other similar applications such as data transfer.</p> <!-- MMD typos: fol, simil s -->
                        <p>It is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure which means that the first item to enter the queue is the first item to leave and new items always get added to the end of the queue.</p> <!-- MMD typo: ancra -->
                        <p>As with the stack we can represent a queue by a one-dimensional array with the need for two pointers. The first to indicate the front of the queue and the other to indicate the next space capable of holding an element joining the queue, these being the head and tail pointers respectively.</p> <!-- MMD typos: capate, poiniers -->
                        <p>A method of inserting and retrieving data is similar to a stack but on 'FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT'</p>

                        <p>The queue operation is awkward because the elements are pushed to the front and new elements are added from the bottom, sometimes referred to as a PUSHUP STACK or LIST.</p>

                        <p>The stack is an example of a data structure found quite commonly in computing which is especially used in system software. They may by used to carry out stages of a calculation, for handling interruptions in translation programs or to pass information from a main program to a subprogram.</p> <!-- MMD typos: exampic, ased, ter -->
                        <p>The main physical characteristic of a stack is that it is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure. It can be likened to a pile of plates in which it is easy (if sometime a little unstable) to add extra plates to the top. Plates can also be easily removed from the top of the pile, but not by extrication from the bottom of the pile.</p>
                        <p>We can represent a stack as a one-dimensional array with two pointers, one pointing to the base of the stack (to identify the first element) and the other pointing to the position of the first available element, this being called the stack pointer. These are only two possible operations that can be done with a stack, namely adding an item to the top of the stack (called stacking or pushing) and the other is that of popping, or taking an item off the stack.</p> <!-- MMD typo: stock -->
