                        <p>In probability theory, if an event occurs, we say we have a success. The probability of a success is defined as:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ p = \frac{\text{No. of successes}}{\text{No. of possible occurrences}} $$</div> <!-- MMD typo: occurences -->
                        <p>If the event we are concerned with does not occur, we have therefore a failure. The probability of a failure is symbolised as q.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ q = \frac{\text{No. of failures}}{\text{No. of possible occurrences}} $$</div> <!-- MMD typo: p=, possibleoccurences -->
                        <p>Since we have either failure or success for an event, and the total probability is 1, therefore</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ p + q = 1 $$</div>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What is the probability of turning up a number greater than 2 with one throw of a dice?</li>
                            <li>What is the probability of turning up a number greater than 0?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The number greater than 2 which are on the faces of the dice are 3, 4, 5 and 6. Thus 4 successful events are possible i.e. s = 4.</li>
                            <li>There are 2 possible unsuccessful events, therefore f = 2 (i.e. turning up the number 1 and 2).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Hence P(number greater than 2) = <span class="math-inline">$\frac{s}{f+s}$</span></p> <!-- MMD typo: f+8 -->
                        <div class="equation">$$ = \frac{4}{2+4} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} $$</div>
                        <p>The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all greater than 0. Hence there are no unsuccessful events i.e. f = 0</p> <!-- MMD typo: geater -->
                        <p>Therefore P(number greater than 0) = <span class="math-inline">$\frac{s}{f+s}$</span></p> <!-- MMD typo: rreater -->
                        <div class="equation">$$ = \frac{6}{0+6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 $$</div>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <p>What is the probability of drawing a club from a pack of 52 cards? (There are 13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 diamonds and 13 spades in a pack.)</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>s = 13 (number of clubs)</p>
                        <p>f = 39 (number of non-clubs)</p>
                        <p>n = f + s = 39 + 13 = 52 (total cards)</p>
                        <p>Therefore P(a club) = <span class="math-inline">$\frac{s}{n} = \frac{13}{52}$</span></p>

                        <p>Example: What is the probability of getting a number not more than 5 with one throw of a dice?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Events (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are mutually exclusive.</p>
                        <p>P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 1/6, P(3) = 1/6, P(4) = 1/6, P(5) = 1/6</p>
                        <p>Therefore P(not more than 5) = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 5/6</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, the probability of getting a number more than 5 (i.e. a 6) is 1/6</p>
                        <p>Therefore P(not more than 5) = 1 - P(more than 5) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6</p>

                        <p>P(Head on 1st throw) = 1/2</p>
                        <p>P(Head on 2nd throw) = 1/2</p>

                        <p>P(four heads) = P(H1) * P(H2) * P(H3) * P(H4) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16</p>

                        <p>P(5 on 1st throw) = 1/6</p>
                        <p>P(5 on 2nd throw) = 1/6</p>
                        <p>Throws are independent.</p>
                        <p>Therefore P(throwing two 5's) = P(5 on 1st) * P(5 on 2nd) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36</p>

                        <p>A (rooted) tree diagram augments the fundamental principle of counting by exhibiting all possible outcomes of a sequence of events where each event can occur in a finite number of ways.</p>

                        <p>Marc and Erik are to play a tennis tournament. The first person to win two games in a row or to win a total of three games wins the tournament.</p>
                        <p>The figure below gives a tree diagram which shows how the tournament can be. The tree is constructed from left to right. At each point (a game) other than an endpoint, there originate two branches which correspond to the two possible outcomes of that game, i.e. Marc (M) winning or Erik (E) winning. Observe that there are 10 end-points corresponding to the 10 possible courses of the tournament:</p>
                        <p>MM, MEMM, MEMEM, MEMEE, MEE, EMM, EMEMM, EMEME, EMEE and EE</p> <!-- MMD typo: FMEMM -->
                        <p>The path from the beginning of the tree to a particular endpoint describes who won which game in that particular course.</p> <!-- MMD typo: narticular -->
