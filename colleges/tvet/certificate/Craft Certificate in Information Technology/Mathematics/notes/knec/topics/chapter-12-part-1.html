The difference between the largest and smallest numbers is called the <strong>range</strong> of the data. For example, if the heaviest weight of 100 male students is 74 kg and the lightest weight is 60 kg, then the range is 74 - 60 which gives 14 kg.</p>

                        <p>When summarising large masses of raw data it is often useful to distribute the data into classes or categories and to determine the number of individuals belonging to each class, called the <strong>class frequency</strong>. A tabular arrangement of these data by classes together with the corresponding class frequencies is called a <strong>frequency distribution</strong> or <strong>frequency table</strong>. The table below shows a frequency distribution of weights (recorded to the nearest kg) of 100 male students at Informatics Computer School.</p> <!-- MMD typo: 2 x 100 -->

                        </div>
                        <p>The first class, for example, consists of weights from 60 to 62 kg. Since 5 students have weights falling between this class, the corresponding class frequency is 5.</p>
                        <p>Data organised and summarised as in the above frequency distribution are often called <strong>grouped data</strong>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12.3.2 Class Intervals and Class Limits</h3>
                        <p>A range of values defining a class such as 60-62 in the above table is called a <strong>class interval</strong>. The end numbers, 60 and 62, are called <strong>class limits</strong>. The smallest number 60 is the <strong>lower class limit</strong> and the larger number 62 is the <strong>upper class limit</strong>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12.3.3 Class Boundaries</h3>
                        <p>If weights are recorded to the nearest kg, the class interval 60-62 theoretically includes all measurements from 59.5 kg to 62.5 kg. These numbers, indicated briefly by the exact numbers 59.5 and 62.5, are called <strong>class boundaries</strong> or true class limits. The smaller number 59.5 is the <strong>lower class boundary</strong> and the larger number 62.5 is the <strong>upper class boundary</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, class boundaries are used to symbolise classes. For example, the various classes in the first column of the previous table could be indicated by 59.5-62.5, 62.5-65.5, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12.3.4 The Size of a Class Interval</h3>
                        <p>The size of a class interval is the difference between the lower and the upper class boundaries and is also referred to as the <strong>class width</strong>, <strong>class size</strong> or class strength. For instance, the class interval size for the above example is 62.5 - 59.5 = 3.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12.3.5 The Class Mark</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>class mark</strong> is the midpoint of the class interval and is obtained by adding the lower and upper class limits and dividing by two. Thus the class mark of the interval 60-62 is (60+62)/2 = 61. The class mark is also known as the <strong>class midpoint</strong>.</p>
                        <p>General rules for forming frequency distributions:</p>

                        <p>A graph is a pictorial representation of the relationship between variables. Many types of graphs are employed in statistics, depending on the nature of the data involved and the purpose for which the graphs are intended.

                        <p>There are two graphical representations of frequency distributions.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>histogram</strong> of a frequency distribution consists of a set of rectangles having</p>

                            <li class="list-item">Bases on a horizontal axis with centres at the class marks and lengths equal to the class interval sizes; and</li>
                            <li class="list-item">Areas proportional to class frequencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A <strong>frequency polygon</strong> corresponding to the above frequencies plotted against class marks. It can be obtained by connecting midpoints of the tops of the rectangles in the histogram.</p>
                        <p>The histogram and frequency polygon corresponding to the frequency distribution of weights are shown on the same set of axes in the graph below. It is necessary to add the extensions PQ and RS to the next lower and higher-class marks which have corresponding class frequency of zero.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12.4.2 Cumulative Frequency Distributions</h3>
                        <p>The total frequency of all values less than the upper class boundary of a given class interval is called the <strong>cumulative frequency</strong> up to and including the class interval. For example, the cumulative frequency up to and including the class interval 66-68 is 5 + 18 + 42 = 65, signifying that altogether 65 students have weights less than 68.5 kg.</p>
                        <p>A graph showing the cumulative frequency less than any upper class boundary plotted against the upper class boundary is called a <strong>cumulative frequency polygon</strong> or <strong>Ogive</strong>.</p>

                        <p>The set of numbers 5, 5, 7, <strong>9, 11</strong>, 12, 15, 18 has a median = (9 + 11) / 2 = 10.</p>
