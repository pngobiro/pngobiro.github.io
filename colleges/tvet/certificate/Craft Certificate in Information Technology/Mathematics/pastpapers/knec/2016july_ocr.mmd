\section*{SECTION B (60 marks)}

\section*{Answer Any FOUR questions in this section}
11. (a) Define each of the following terms as used in set theory:
(i) subset;
(ii) universal set.
(b) Construct a graph for the equation $y=3 x^{2}+4 x-4$ for $-3 \leq x \leq 2$ using the grid provided at the end of this paper:
Hence, solve the equation $y=3 x^{2}+4 x-4$
(c) The captain of Kitweli football team is required to choose a committee of 4 members from a team comprising 3 women and 4 men. Determine each of the following:
(i) the number of ways the committee could be chosen;
(ii) the number of ways in which the committee can be chosen comprising 2 men and 2 women;
(iii) the probability that the committee consists of 2 men and 2 women;
12. (a) Explain three types of mathematical functions giving an example in each case.
(b) Using the binomial expansion determine the first four terms in the expansion of
$$(1-2 y)^{8} \text { in ascending order of } y .$$

Hence determine the value of $0.98^{8}$ (ii) correct to 4 decimal places.
(c) Differentiate between mode and median as used in statistics.
13. (a) Given three matrices; X is a $2 \times 3, \mathrm{Y}$ is a $2 \times 2$ and Z is a $3 \times 2$;
(i) identify possible matrix products from the following;
$$\mathrm{XY}, \mathrm{YX}, \mathrm{XZ} \text { and } \mathrm{YZ} .$$
(ii) State the size of the resultant matrix from the matrix product identified in (i).
