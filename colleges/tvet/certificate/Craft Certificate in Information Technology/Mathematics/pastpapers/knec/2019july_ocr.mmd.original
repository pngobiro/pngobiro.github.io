(ii) $153_{8}$ to hexadecimal.
12. (a) Table 1 shows the probability of selling a specified number of cars by a certain car dealer in a certain month. Use it to answer the question that follows.

Table 1
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Number of cars & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\
\hline Probability (x) & 0.10 & 0.15 & 0.15 & 0.25 & 0.20 & 0.10 & 0.0 & 0.05 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Determine the number of cars the car dealer expects to sell during the period. (2 marks)
(b) Use the substitution method to solve the following pair of simultaneous equations:
$$\begin{aligned}
& 3 x-y=11 \\
& 3 x-2 y=4
\end{aligned}$$
