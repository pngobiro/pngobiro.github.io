\section*{SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATE}
1. Create a folder named KNECEXAMINDEXNO on the desktop where Index No is the candidate's Index Number assigned in this examination.
2. Ensure that the KNECEXAMINDEXNO folder created and all its content is burnt onto the Rewritable CD at the end of the examination.

\section*{Task 1}
(a) Open a word processing program and create the following document as it appears. Save the document as digitaldivide in the KNECEXAMINDFXNO folder to print out later. ( 15 marks)

The digital divide, in brief, is the gap between people who have access to computer technology and people who do not hate. It appears that, as the numbers of people geing online increascs. the gap also grows.

Digital divide in formal be overcome with firther networking. Instead this

schooling is not simply an equipment dilferential that can selective investments in hardware, sotware, and factors are excavated by factors from within sehorl and homes that affeet the leamer.

\section*{Factors Attributing to the Digital Divide}
a) Education

Widening levels of education magnify the digital divide; households with higher levels of education are increasingly more likely to use computers and the Internet.
b) Income

Due to lower insome levels, schools focated within poor neighbourhood tack the infrastructure available in athuent areas. Telecommunication facilities are more readily available for sehools in the later areas hence enhancing the leamers ability to collaborate with other learners.
c) Resistance to change

Schools headed by those who are computer literate are likely to better in terms of acquing necessary resources than a school headed by an individual who is not conputer literate.

\section*{Overcoming the Digital Divide}

M
(a) Universal Access

As the use of computers and the Internet increases, so does the necessity for access
(b) Continued Support by the national government and county government.
They should work hand in hand to promote the use of ICT's in schools.
(c)Additional, Welf-Trained

Technical Staff Communities and schools must train and preserve additional, and more qualitied staff.
alongside new technologies to promote the best application of resources.
(d) Change of Attitude Regarding Technology.
Rather than perceiving computers and the Internct as a superfluous luxury in schools, must come to realize the incredible power of new technolugies and embrace them as tools for their future.
