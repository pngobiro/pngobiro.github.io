\section*{SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATE}
1. Create a folder named KNECEXAM on the desktop to store all the work done on this paper.
2. Ensure that the KNECEXAM folder and all its content is burnt onto the Rewritable CD at the end of the examination.
（a）Open a word processing program and key in the following text as it appears．Save the document as WATERHARVESTING in the KNECEXAM folder．

\section*{WATERHARVESTING}

Water harvesting is the activity of direct collection of rainwater．The rainwater collected can be stored for direct use or can be recharged into groundwater．
Rain is the first form of primary source of water．Rivers，lakes and groundwater are all secondary sources of water．In present times，we mostly depend on such secondary sources of water．

Water harvesting can be undertaken through the following ways：
＞Capturing runoff from rooftops．
＞Capturing runoff from local catchments．
＞Capturing seasonal floodwaters from local streams．

Harvested water can serve the following purposes：

1）Provide drinking water．
2）Provide irrigation water．
3）Increase groundwater recharge．
4）Reduce storm water discharges．
（b）（i）Open a new blank word processing document and create Table 1 as it appears below． Save the document as AmtRainfall in the KNECEXAM folder．
