This report outlines the methodology, findings, and recommendations based on the investigation conducted between [Start Date] and [End Date].</p>

                                     <p><strong>2.0 Procedure / Methodology</strong><br>
                                     The investigation involved the following methods:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Analysis of sales data for the past two years.</li>
                                         <li>Customer surveys conducted at the branch and surrounding areas.</li>
                                         <li>Interviews with branch staff (manager, cashiers, floor staff).</li>
                                         <li>Competitor analysis within the branch's vicinity.</li>
                                         <li>Review of branch location and accessibility.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>3.0 Findings</strong><br>
                                     The investigation revealed several factors contributing to the branch's poor performance:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li><strong>3.1 Location and Accessibility:</strong> The branch is situated in an area with limited foot traffic and inconvenient public transport access compared to competitors.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.2 Competition:</strong> Two established supermarkets nearby offer wider product ranges and aggressive pricing.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.3 Product Range & Stocking:</strong> Customers reported dissatisfaction with the variety of goods offered, particularly fresh produce, and instances of stockouts for popular items.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.4 Marketing and Awareness:</strong> There is low awareness of the branch in the local community due to insufficient marketing efforts since its launch.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.5 Staff Morale:</strong> Some staff members expressed concerns about unclear targets and limited opportunities, potentially impacting customer service.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>4.0 Conclusion</strong><br>
                                     The poor performance of the [Branch Name] branch stems primarily from suboptimal location, strong competition, gaps in product offering, and inadequate marketing. Addressing these key areas is crucial for improving sales and profitability.</p>

                         <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                         <div class="question-content">
                             <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.</p>
                             <div class="passage">
                                 <p>The Irish potato is the third most widely consumed food crop in the world after rice and wheat. In Kenya, it is the most important staple crop after maize. It is rich in protein, calcium and low-fat carbohydrates. In addition, potato farming is a source of employment and income to many farmers in the country. Thus, it plays a key role in food security.</p>
                                 <p>There has been a notable increase in potato production in Kenya over the years. However, the rise in production has mainly been due to an increase in the acreage under cultivation as opposed to an increase in yield per acre. Low yields and returns can be attributed to a number of challenges that are experienced by the farmers. One such challenge is poor quality seeds. Majority of the seeds are selected by farmers from their previous harvests or bought from other farmers. This poses a challenge as such seeds are prone to seed degeneration and passing on of diseases. Besides, farmers prefer to use the smaller tubers as seeds mainly because commercial potato middlemen discriminate against small tubers. Such seeds are prone to disease attack and produce few tubers, hence reducing productivity. To overcome this problem, farmers should use certified seeds from reliable sources such as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization. Alternatively, if farmers choose to use self supplied seeds, they should select healthy and relatively big ones which are less prone to diseases.</p>
                                 <p>Another challenge experienced by farmers is crop disease. Late blight is the most dangerous disease affecting potatoes worldwide and it destroys leaves, stems and tubers. Other diseases include bacterial wilt and potato blackleg. These diseases are caused by close rotations and continuous mono-cropping. Poor agricultural practices such as late weeding and ridging are a further challenge. Such practices contribute to low yields and can be very frustrating to farmers. Poor storage is also a major challenge to potato farmers. After harvest, storage of potatoes is necessary either for use as seeds or for sale when prices go up. Exposing potatoes to much light encourages sprouting of shoots while still under storage. Sale of such potatoes, therefore, becomes a challenge.</p>
                                 <p>In addition, packaging of potatoes for sale is a serious challenge. Extended bags are still in use despite existence of a law prohibiting the exploitative practice. Besides robbing farmers, the practice is tedious and damages the produce, escalating wastage. Lack of adequate information on marketing potatoes is another challenge. Many farmers plant without prior knowledge of whether the demand of that particular variety is available. Disorganized marketing systerns lead to great disparities between farm and market prices. Unfortunately, farmers are on the tail end of the bargain as brokers dictate farm gate prices.</p>
                                 <p>Furthermore, use of poor technology in potato farming is a challenge. Farmers largely use hoes to cultivate their farms. To increase efficiency and output, farmers should use modern technology such as small tractors. Lack of value addition to potatoes through dehydration, freezing and processing is also a challenge. In general, potatoes are harvested around the same time in a given geographical region leading to oversupply. This leads to a glut during the harvesting seasons that makes the farmers to experience heavy post-harvest losses.</p>
                                 <p>If these challenges are addressed, potatoes will contribute significantly to food security in this potentially rich country. Research shows that Kenya can produce huge amounts of potatoes because it has a conducive environment not found in other East African countries. This will not only go a long way in addressing food insecurity but also contribute significantly to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

                                 <p><strong>(b) Challenges experienced by potato farmers:</strong></p>
                                 <p>According to the passage, potato farmers in Kenya face several challenges impacting yield and income. A major issue is the use of poor quality seeds, often saved from previous harvests or sourced unreliably, leading to disease transmission and degeneration. Crop diseases themselves, like late blight and bacterial wilt, are prevalent due to practices like mono-cropping. Poor agricultural methods, such as late weeding, further reduce yields. Post-harvest, inadequate storage facilities cause losses, especially due to sprouting induced by light exposure. Farmers also suffer from exploitative packaging practices using non-standardized bags and disorganized marketing systems where brokers dictate low farm gate prices due to lack of market information. Additionally, reliance on basic technology like hoes limits efficiency, and a lack of value addition processes contributes to gluts and losses during peak harvest seasons.</p>
