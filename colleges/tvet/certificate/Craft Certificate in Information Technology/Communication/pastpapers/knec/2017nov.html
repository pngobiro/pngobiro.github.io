                        <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                        <div class="question-content">
                            <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow it.</p>
                            <div class="passage">
                                <p>Many Kenyans are seeking ways of owning property in the form of land and housing. There are various ways of acquiring such property. One such method is through joint venture agreements. Joint ventures are agreements between land owners and investors aimed at developing unused land by building houses and other facilities on the land. There are various steps involved in a joint venture agreement. First, the land owner takes the investor for a site visit so that the investor and his team can inspect the land and establish its viability. They look at the infrastructure, size and shape of the land, ground level, neighbourhood, by-laws and proximity to basic amenities such as hospitals. This enables the investor to determine the most appropriate type of development for that particular parcel of land.</p>
                                <p>After visiting the site and deciding on the nature of development to be undertaken, the investor makes a proposal to the land owner. This step involves offering a percentage of the built-up area to the land owner. These percentages are arrived at after taking into account factors such as the cost of the land, the cost of construction, escalation in cost of construction, administrative fees and the selling price of the completed units in the project. Land owners who do not want to get involved in the day-to-day running of the project, or to be responsible for any losses associated with the project, prefer this arrangement. If the land owner accepts the investor's proposal, the next step involves starting the formalities of drafting the main agreement. At this stage, the land owner avails copies of the title documents for verification by the investor's lawyer.</p>
                                <p>Once the investor's lawyer approves the title, he then makes a draft copy of the joint development contract. In this step, the terms and conditions of the development are laid down and presented to the land owner for approval. Usually, the land owner gets his or her lawyer to study the contract before approving it. If everything is okay, the contract is signed by both parties, stamped and, in most cases, registered under the Registration of Documents at the Ministry of Lands.</p>
                                <p>Once the joint venture agreement has been signed, the next step is to form a special-purpose company, whose aim is to implement the agreement. The new company formed should be registered as a private limited company under the Companies Act of the Laws of Kenya. After formation of the company, the next step is the registration of the transfer of the land in favour of the newly formed company. To facilitate this step, the land owner avails to the lawyer all the relevant deeds and documents.</p>
                                <p>The registration then leads to hiring of a project architect who prepares a plan for the project. The land owner has to approve the plan after which it is submitted to the government authorities for approval. Once the approval by the relevant bodies has been received, development - which is the final step - begins. At this juncture, some investors start placing adverts in the local dailies indicating availability of the houses for sale.</p>
                                <p>On completion of the project, the houses allocated to the landowner are handed over to him or her. The landowner is free to sell any of the houses allocated to him or her at any stage of the construction, or even after completion. The formula for sharing profits from the project will have been negotiated and agreed upon before the signing of the agreement which clearly spells out the terms.</p>

                                <p>The process begins with a site visit where the investor inspects the land's viability by examining infrastructure, size, location, and amenities. Following this, the investor makes a proposal offering the landowner a percentage of the built-up area, calculated based on various costs and selling prices. If accepted, legal proceedings begin with title verification by the investor's lawyer, followed by contract drafting. After both parties' lawyers review the contract, it is signed, stamped, and registered. A special-purpose company is then formed and registered. The land is transferred to this company, after which an architect prepares plans for approval by both landowner and government authorities. Once approved, development commences, and upon completion, the agreed-upon allocation of units is made to the landowner.</p>
