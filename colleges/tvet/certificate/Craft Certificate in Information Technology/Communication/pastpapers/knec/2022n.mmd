Lake Turkana is the source of livelihood fogmore than 20,000 families through commercial fishing activities. However, the lake's water volume is likely to decline by 60 per cent in the next five to seven years. This is duesto the construction of the Gibe Dam on Omo River by the Ethiopian govermment for irrigation and to generate electricity. While the dam will boost development in Ethiopia, civil rights groups argue that thousands of indigenous families downstream who depend on fishing and pastoralism, among others, stand to lose. The groups argue that the dam has interfered with fish breeding zones in the River Omo which drains 90 per cent of its water into Lake Turkana. Subsequently, there has been a drop in fish stocks in the lake. This has resulted in a scramble for fish between the Turkana community and their Merile counterparts from Ethiopia.

The transformation of several hectares of grazing fields in the River Omo basin into crop production is driving pastoralists from Ethiopia to invade Turkana North for pasture and water, Most parts of the basin are under crop production through irrigation systems. This has resulted in scarcity of pasture for members of the pastoral communities. Indeed, some members of the Merile community have abandoned pastoralism and embraced agricultural production which
they consider more lucrative, hence the scramble for agro-pastoralism land. Population pressure is also causing conflict among pastoralists from the two countries. Even though the pastoralists have embraced farming, fish remains the main source of food and income to the Merile, Dasanach, Turkana and El Molo communities. The continued meddling with River Omo's breeding zones is posing a major threat to their socio-economic livelihood.

According to the Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Lake Turkana has a potential of generating $\mathrm{K} \operatorname{sh} 3$ billion annually if proper management plans are put in place. However, KMFRI cites interference of fish breeding zones, silfation, use of improper fishing gears and poor handling processes as some of the factors that contribute to the waning quantities of fish and reduced revenue generation. Mismanagement of the Kalokool fish processing plant and frequent attacks on fishermen by militias are other factors that are derailing fishing activities in Lake Turkana. It is also claimed that the processing plant does not operate at its maximum capacity due to interference by politicians who have vested interests in the plant. Additionally, frequent attacks by militias have scared away potential investors from engaging in commercial fishing activities that would improve income generation and the livelihoods of the locals.

Following a peace agreement between Kenyan and Ethiopian leaders to contain armed conflict, the government has deployed additional Kenya Marine Police to patrol the lake and promote trade. It is expected that this action will facilitate commercial fishing and boost income generation. Before this action was taken, fishing activities at the lake had drastically declined after most traders moved out following regurrent attacks by raiders from the two communities. The Turkana County Government has procured equipment worth Ksh. 51 million and an offshore patrol motorboat to enhance income generation from the fishing activities. This has seen income generation from fish around Lake Turkana increase from Ksh. 12 million to Ksh. 16 million and the production improving from 31 tonnes to 35 tonnes within six months.

Among equipment the county government acquired include 12,661 fishing nets and 15,000 floaters that were distributed to fishermen along the lake. The county also plans to procure an extra motorboat and fibre glass boats to access deeper water for big fish as 97 per cent of fishermen in the lake are still restricted at the periphery. The county government also released Ksh. 31 million for reviving the Turkana Fishermen Cooperative Society that was active in the early 1990s. The society will buy and process fish from members and establish ready markets to boost the fishing sector in Northern Kenya.
