                        <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                        <div class="question-content">
                            <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.</p>
                            <div class="passage">
                                <p>With entrepreneurship gaining popularity, competition has become stiff and only the very best entrepreneurs will thrive. This is because business nowadays can be tricky as people change their preferences and tastes every now and then. Moreover, technology is fast changing the way of doing business. For instance, Internet and product delivery to anywhere and at any time has changed the rules of competition.</p>
                                <p>Getting customers to come again and again is the most important endeavour of every business. No business can be successful if it is continually dealing with new customers. Repeat customers are the source of profit, and this allows a business to grow and prosper. While there have been signs of growth being recorded in various sectors of the economy, many businesses continue to experience poor performance and reduced profits. As a result of these tough economic conditions, customer loyalty has gained popularity among businesses trying to maintain their profitability.</p>
                                <p>To gain customer loyalty, there are several principles that an entrepreneur should follow. Practicing effective communication is one such principle. It pays to reach out to repeat buyers through various means such as e-mail, newsletter, monthly fliers, a reminder card or holiday greeting card. Such customers should always be informed of any change in business processes, products or services. Offering good customer service is also an important principle. Entrepreneurs should always go an extra mile to meet customer needs by training employees to ensure customer satisfaction. This is because customers remember being treated well and knowing that they are valued.</p>
                                <p>In addition, an entrepreneur can give customers incentives such as free offers, coupons, low interest rates and so on. This gives customers a reason to return to the business. Moreover, a business should be reliable to attract customer loyalty. For instance, an entrepreneur should let customers know when something goes wrong and compensate them for the inconvenience. Being flexible is a further principle that an entrepreneur should apply when solving customers' problems or handling complaints. Excuses such as "that's our policy" will only lead to loss of more business.</p>
                                <p>Besides, customers should get value for their money. Value for money is the amount that a customer will get from a service or product in relation to the cost. A good entrepreneur should give a free trial period for a product or service to gain brand loyalty. This principle ensures that the customers will return not only to buy the same product but also to try other products and services offered by the entrepreneur. Furthermore, an entrepreneur should have product awareness. This is by understanding the products the business is dealing in.</p>
                                <p>For these principles to be followed effectively, employees - who are major stakeholders - should be involved in every business activity. Employees play an important role building customer loyalty and in ensuring that the efforts by a business to maintain loyal customers are fruitful. Training the employee's ability to provide superior service to customers should, therefore, be seen as a long-term value addition initiative.</p>
                                <p>Besides, effort spent in selecting and training employees can lead to increased employee satisfaction and competence. This will result in customer satisfaction which in turn will create customer loyalty hence improved sales and higher profit margins.</p>
