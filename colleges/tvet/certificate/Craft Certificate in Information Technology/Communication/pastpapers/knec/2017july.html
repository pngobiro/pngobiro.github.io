                                The investigation involved:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reviewing HR records on conductor departures over the past [Time Period, e.g., 6-12 months].</li>
                                    <li>Conducting confidential exit interviews (where possible) or surveys with former conductors.</li>
                                    <li>Holding informal discussion groups with current conductors.</li>
                                    <li>Interviewing route supervisors and driver representatives.</li>
                                    <li>Analyzing compensation, working hours, and route assignment data.</li>
                                    <li>Benchmarking conductor terms and conditions with competing transport companies.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>3. Findings</strong><br>
                                The primary reasons identified for high conductor turnover include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Low Basic Pay & Commission Structure:</strong> Many former and current conductors cited inadequate basic salary and dissatisfaction with the commission structure, especially on less busy routes, as a major reason for leaving. Competitor analysis suggests our basic pay is below the industry average.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Long and Irregular Working Hours:</strong> Extended shifts and unpredictable schedules lead to burnout and difficulty maintaining work-life balance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Difficult Working Conditions:</strong> Challenges include dealing with difficult passengers, security concerns on certain routes/times, and pressure to meet targets.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Poor Relationship with Drivers/Supervisors:</strong> Some conductors reported conflicts with drivers over fare collection or lack of support from route supervisors.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of Career Growth Opportunities:</strong> Limited prospects for advancement within the company were mentioned as a demotivating factor.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong><br>
                                High conductor turnover is primarily driven by dissatisfaction with compensation and demanding working hours, compounded by challenging working conditions and perceived lack of support or growth opportunities.</p>

                                <p><strong>5. Recommendations</strong><br>
                                To improve conductor retention, the following actions are recommended:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Review Compensation Structure:</strong> Conduct a thorough review of basic pay and commission rates to ensure competitiveness within the industry. Consider performance-based incentives beyond just fare collection.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Optimize Scheduling:</strong> Explore options for more predictable schedules, potentially implementing rota systems or limiting consecutive long shifts. Ensure compliance with legal working hour limits.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Enhance Support & Security:</strong> Provide better training for handling difficult passengers, improve communication channels with supervisors, and review security measures on high-risk routes/times.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improve Driver-Conductor Relations:</strong> Facilitate joint meetings or training sessions to improve teamwork and clarify roles/responsibilities regarding fare collection and passenger management.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Introduce Development Pathways:</strong> Explore potential career progression opportunities, such as senior conductor roles or pathways into supervisory positions.</li>
                                </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p>Implementing these recommendations is crucial for stabilizing our workforce, improving service quality, and reducing the costs associated with high turnover.</p>

                        <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                        <div class="question-content">
                            <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow it.</p>
                            <div class="passage">
                                <p>Many Kenyans are seeking ways of owning property in the form of land and housing. There are various ways of acquiring such property. One such method is through joint venture agreements. Joint ventures are agreements between land owners and investors aimed at developing unused land by building houses and other facilities on the land. There are various steps involved in a joint venture agreement. First, the land owner takes the investor for a site visit so that the investor and his team can inspect the land and establish its viability. They look at the infrastructure, size and shape of the land, ground level, neighbourhood, by-laws and proximity to basic amenities such as hospitals. This enables the investor to determine the most appropriate type of development for that particular parcel of land.</p>
                                <p>After visiting the site and deciding on the nature of development to be undertaken, the investor makes a proposal to the land owner. This step involves offering a percentage of the built-up area to the land owner. These percentages are arrived at after taking into account factors such as the cost of the land, the cost of construction, escalation in cost of construction, administrative fees and the selling price of the completed units in the project. Land owners who do not want to get involved in the day-to-day running of the project, or to be responsible for any losses associated with the project, prefer this arrangement. If the land owner accepts the investor's proposal, the next step involves starting the formalities of drafting the main agreement. At this stage, the land owner avails copies of the title documents for verification by the investor's lawyer.</p>
                                <p>Once the investor's lawyer approves the title, he then makes a draft copy of the joint development contract. In this step, the terms and conditions of the development are laid down and presented to the land owner for approval. Usually, the land owner gets his or her lawyer to study the contract before approving it. If everything is okay, the contract is signed by both parties, stamped and, in most cases, registered under the Registration of Documents at the Ministry of Lands.</p>
                                <p>Once the joint venture agreement has been signed, the next step is to form a special-purpose company, whose aim is to implement the agreement. The new company formed should be registered as a private limited company under the Companies Act of the Laws of Kenya. After formation of the company, the next step is the registration of the transfer of the land in favour of the newly formed company. To facilitate this step, the land owner avails to the lawyer all the relevant deeds and documents.</p>
                                <p>The registration then leads to hiring of a project architect who prepares a plan for the project. The land owner has to approve the plan after which it is submitted to the government authorities for approval. Once the approval by the relevant bodies has been received, development - which is the final step - begins. At this juncture, some investors start placing adverts in the local dailies indicating availability of the houses for sale.</p>
                                <p>On completion of the project, the houses allocated to the landowner are handed over to him or her. The landowner is free to sell any of the houses allocated to him or her at any stage of the construction, or even after completion. The formula for sharing profits from the project will have been negotiated and agreed upon before the signing of the agreement which clearly spells out the terms.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Steps in a Joint Venture Agreement (Summary):</strong></p>
                                <p>A joint venture agreement begins with the landowner facilitating a site visit for the investor to assess the land's viability, considering factors like infrastructure, size, location, and by-laws to determine the best development type. The investor then proposes a deal, often offering the landowner a percentage of the built-up area based on land/construction costs and selling prices. If accepted, lawyers draft the main agreement; the investor's lawyer verifies title documents, drafts the contract detailing terms, and the landowner's lawyer reviews it before both parties sign. The signed contract is stamped and often registered. Next, a special-purpose private limited company is formed to implement the project. The land title is transferred to this new company. An architect is hired, prepares plans which the landowner approves, and these plans are submitted for government approval. Once approved, development commences, and marketing may begin. Upon completion, the landowner receives their allocated units.</p>
