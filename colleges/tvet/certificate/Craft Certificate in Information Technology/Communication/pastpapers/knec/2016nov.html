                        <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                        <div class="question-content">
                            <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow it.</p>
                            <div class="passage">
                                <p>Urbanization is the movement of people from rural to urban areas in search of economic opportunities. One researcher describes it as "a necessary evil" which is slowing down wind speed as buildings and other structures block the wind's flow path. As a result, pollutants are not being properly dispersed thus putting the health of hundreds of thousands of city residents at risk.</p>
                                <p>According to research, one such urban setting is Nairobi whose industries have been polluting air up to 100 kilometres away. The populations most at risk have not been those that live within the city, but those who reside a few kilometres away; from Kangemi to Limuru to Naivasha. In a paper presented in Paris by a team of Kenyan scientists, the researchers said that "the winds in Nairobi city are mainly easterlies, implying that the pollutants are transported southwest and northwest of the town." When these substances are inhaled, they cause respiratory infections especially among the young and the elderly. The chemicals may also cause eye disease.</p>
                                <p>The researchers' findings seem to be in agreement with the Kenya 2014 Economic Survey which reported that respiratory infections caused the highest number of illnesses in Kenya in 2013. The study, conducted between January and December 2013, showed that most of the commercial activities in Nairobi are concentrated within the city centre whereas most of the industrial activities are located to the southeast of the city. According to the researchers, the transport and dispersion of pollutants from one locality to another is sparked off-by wind, rainfall, air temperature and relative humidity. However, urbanization slows down wind speed due to the tall buildings and structures along the wind's flow path.</p>
                                <p>While the air in Nairobi might not have the same number of pollutants as those recorded in its southwesterly neighbourhoods, city dwellers are not safe either. Increased temperatures due to energy use, vehicle emissions and dwindling tree cover are gradually leading to an "urban heat island". This means that Nairobi area has higher temperatures than the surrounding regions. This in turn reduces atmospheric pressure in the city thus affecting wind speed and, over time, trapping the pollutants within the city. Air pollution negatively impacts human health and has been proven to be dangerous even with short-term exposure. It causes wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat and triggering of existing respiratory conditions such as asthma.</p>
                                <p>Further, dirty air causes lung damage as well as heart disease, stroke and cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in eight deaths worldwide in 2013 resulted from air pollution. Of these, around 630,000 were from Africa. Air pollution is also a contributor of acid rain which has been responsible for a lot of damage to soil. fish resources and vegetation often very far away from the source of the pollutant. It also causes smog which is a reduction in visibility due to scattering of light by airborne particles.</p>
                                <p>The sources of air pollution are identified as soot and carbon due to incomplete burning of fossil fuels such as diesel in traffic, methane emitted in livestock manure, burning of plastics, refrigeration as well as various other industrial gases that have a warming effect on climate. Other sources include mining and cement production which release dust and carbon dioxide to the environment.</p>
                                <p>Health experts and environmental activists are concerned that these sources of pollution will continue to exist in the atmosphere for over 15 years before they are eliminated. In 'Time to Act to Reduce Short-lived Climate Pollutants', a report by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition in conjunction with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), researchers warn that air pollution is now the world's largest single environmental health risk.</p>

                                <p>Air pollution poses significant risks to human health, even with short-term exposure. It causes respiratory issues like wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, and can trigger existing conditions like asthma. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to dirty air can lead to serious lung damage, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The World Health Organization highlights its severity, estimating it caused one in eight global deaths in 2013, with a substantial number in Africa. Pollutants inhaled, particularly from industrial and traffic emissions concentrated in urban areas or transported by wind, are the primary cause of these health problems, affecting both city dwellers and surrounding populations.</p>
