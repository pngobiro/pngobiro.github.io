itself. Member education, a key principle of the cooperative sector, is a critical pillar because it provides an opportunity for Saccos to educate members on their rights and responsibilities. Saccos should ensure that members understand what exactly they are signing up for when they decide to join the Sacco.

Members are expected to provide the first level of oversight to ensure that their interests are protected. However, this is a challenge due to the unique structure of Saccos. In this structure, the member is an owner, a depositor and a borrower. The Sacco board and management should effectively engage the members to maintain and enhance a democratic balance which is a key requirement for cooperative enterprises. This way, members can provide the primary oversight expected of them as owners.

The next level for member protection is at the regulator level. SASRA enhances the governance of the Sacco and ensures sound business decisions that protect the members' interests. Besides efficient regulation, a safety net mechanism for the Sacco industry is critical. This will be achieved by operationalizing the Deposit Guarantee Fund with the legal mandate to dissolve failed Saccos and compensate depositors.
