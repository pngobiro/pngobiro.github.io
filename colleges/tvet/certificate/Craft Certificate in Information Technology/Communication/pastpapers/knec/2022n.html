                                     <p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> REPORT ON INVESTIGATION INTO DECREASED LIBRARY USAGE</p>

                                     <p><strong>1.0 Introduction / Terms of Reference</strong><br>
                                     As requested, this report presents the findings of an investigation into the significant decrease in student library usage over the past year. The investigation aimed to identify the contributing factors and propose recommendations to encourage greater utilization of library resources.</p>

                                     <p><strong>2.0 Methodology</strong><br>
                                     The investigation involved the following methods:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Analysis of library entry logs and borrowing statistics for the past two years.</li>
                                         <li>Online survey distributed to a sample of students across different departments.</li>
                                         <li>Focus group discussions with student representatives.</li>
                                         <li>Interviews with library staff.</li>
                                         <li>Review of library opening hours, resource availability (books, journals, computers), and study space environment.</li>
                                         <li>Comparison with library services offered at similar colleges.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>3.0 Findings</strong><br>
                                     Several factors appear to contribute to the decline in library usage:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li><strong>3.1 Limited Opening Hours:</strong> Current hours, especially during evenings and weekends, are inconvenient for many students, particularly those with part-time jobs or evening classes.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.2 Outdated Resources:</strong> Students reported that key textbooks and journals for some courses are outdated or unavailable. There's a perceived lack of relevant digital resources compared to online alternatives.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.3 Insufficient Study Spaces:</strong> During peak times, finding adequate quiet study space or group discussion areas is difficult. The available computers are often slow or insufficient in number.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.4 Lack of Awareness:</strong> Many students, especially newer ones, are unaware of the full range of services offered by the library (e.g., research support, inter-library loans, digital databases).</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.5 Environment:</strong> Some feedback mentioned the library environment feels uninviting or lacks comfortable seating/modern amenities.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>4.0 Conclusion</strong><br>
                                     The decrease in library usage stems from a combination of factors including inconvenient hours, resource gaps (physical and digital), inadequate study facilities, and insufficient promotion of library services.</p>

                                     <p><strong>5.0 Recommendations</strong><br>
                                     To revitalize library usage, the following actions are recommended:</p>
                                     <ol>
                                         <li><strong>Extend Opening Hours:</strong> Review and extend library hours, particularly during evenings and weekends, based on student feedback.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Update Resource Collection:</strong> Allocate budget to update key textbooks, subscribe to relevant online journals/databases, and potentially implement a student book request system.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Improve Study Facilities:</strong> Reconfigure existing space to create more varied study zones (quiet, group). Investigate upgrading/increasing the number of computers.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Promote Library Services:</strong> Implement an awareness campaign (posters, social media, orientation sessions) highlighting available resources and support services.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Enhance Environment:</strong> Consider minor refurbishments to make the space more welcoming (e.g., better lighting, comfortable furniture).</li>
                                     </ol>

                                     <p>Implementing these recommendations should make the library a more accessible, resourceful, and inviting space for students.</p>

                         <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                         <div class="question-content">
                             <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow it.</p>
                             <div class="passage">
                                 <p>Lake Turkana is the source of livelihood for more than 20,000 families through commercial fishing activities. However, the lake's water volume is likely to decline by 60 per cent in the next five to seven years. This is due to the construction of the Gibe Dam on Omo River by the Ethiopian government for irrigation and to generate electricity. While the dam will boost development in Ethiopia, civil rights groups argue that thousands of indigenous families downstream who depend on fishing and pastoralism, among others, stand to lose. The groups argue that the dam has interfered with fish breeding zones in the River Omo which drains 90 per cent of its water into Lake Turkana. Subsequently, there has been a drop in fish stocks in the lake. This has resulted in a scramble for fish between the Turkana community and their Merile counterparts from Ethiopia.</p>
                                 <p>The transformation of several hectares of grazing fields in the River Omo basin into crop production is driving pastoralists from Ethiopia to invade Turkana North for pasture and water. Most parts of the basin are under crop production through irrigation systems. This has resulted in scarcity of pasture for members of the pastoral communities. Indeed, some members of the Merile community have abandoned pastoralism and embraced agricultural production which they consider more lucrative, hence the scramble for agro-pastoralism land. Population pressure is also causing conflict among pastoralists from the two countries. Even though the pastoralists have embraced farming, fish remains the main source of food and income to the Merile, Dasanach, Turkana and El Molo communities. The continued meddling with River Omo's breeding zones is posing a major threat to their socio-economic livelihood.</p>
                                 <p>According to the Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Lake Turkana has a potential of generating Ksh 3 billion annually if proper management plans are put in place. However, KMFRI cites interference of fish breeding zones, siltation, use of improper fishing gears and poor handling processes as some of the factors that contribute to the waning quantities of fish and reduced revenue generation. Mismanagement of the Kalokool fish processing plant and frequent attacks on fishermen by militias are other factors that are derailing fishing activities in Lake Turkana. It is also claimed that the processing plant does not operate at its maximum capacity due to interference by politicians who have vested interests in the plant. Additionally, frequent attacks by militias have scared away potential investors from engaging in commercial fishing activities that would improve income generation and the livelihoods of the locals.</p>
                                 <p>Following a peace agreement between Kenyan and Ethiopian leaders to contain armed conflict, the government has deployed additional Kenya Marine Police to patrol the lake and promote trade. It is expected that this action will facilitate commercial fishing and boost income generation. Before this action was taken, fishing activities at the lake had drastically declined after most traders moved out following recurrent attacks by raiders from the two communities. The Turkana County Government has procured equipment worth Ksh. 51 million and an offshore patrol motorboat to enhance income generation from the fishing activities. This has seen income generation from fish around Lake Turkana increase from Ksh. 12 million to Ksh. 16 million and the production improving from 31 tonnes to 35 tonnes within six months.</p>
                                 <p>Among equipment the county government acquired include 12,661 fishing nets and 15,000 floaters that were distributed to fishermen along the lake. The county also plans to procure an extra motorboat and fibre glass boats to access deeper water for big fish as 97 per cent of fishermen in the lake are still restricted at the periphery. The county government also released Ksh. 31 million for reviving the Turkana Fishermen Cooperative Society that was active in the early 1990s. The society will buy and process fish from members and establish ready markets to boost the fishing sector in Northern Kenya.</p>

                                 <p><strong>(b) Summary: Measures to Revive Lake Turkana Fishing:</strong></p>
                                 <p>Several measures aim to revive Lake Turkana's declining fishing industry. Following a peace agreement, the government deployed more Kenya Marine Police to patrol the lake, enhancing security and promoting trade, which had suffered due to militia attacks. The Turkana County Government invested significantly by procuring equipment worth Ksh. 51 million, including an offshore patrol boat, thousands of fishing nets, and floaters, distributing these to local fishermen. This investment led to increased income and production within six months. Future plans include acquiring another motorboat and fibreglass boats to enable fishing in deeper waters. Additionally, Ksh. 31 million was released to revive the Turkana Fishermen Cooperative Society, which will buy, process, and market fish for its members, boosting the sector.</p>
