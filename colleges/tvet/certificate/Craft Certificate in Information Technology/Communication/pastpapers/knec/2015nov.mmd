Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.
The 14 -seater public service vehicles, commonly referred to as matatus, have for a long time been the most popular mode of public transport for Kenyans. However, due to various reasons, the vehicles are being pushed out of business. To begin with, rising operation costs due to shortage of spare parts and a surge in the number of high occupancy vehicles are taking a toll on the matatus. The shortage of spare parts has been caused by importers who are cautious due to plans by the government to phase cut the 14 -seater matatus. These plans are part of a wider strategy to reduce traffic congestion in major towns.

Faced with this reality, most transporters have moved fast to acquire high-capacity vehicles even as the government prepares to fully implement the new policy on urban public transport. A spot check on most city routes shows that minibuses are gradually taking over and pushing the 14 -seater out of business. The Matatu Welfare Association says that it has registered a 25 per cent decline in the number of 14 -seaters on the roads. In fact most of them are being forced to operate at night when the minibuses take a break.

Due to the increase in the number of high occupancy vehicles, many operators of public service vehicles (PSV) have realised that it is not longer profitable to operate a 14 -seater vehicle. The minibuses have brought about stiff competition which is nearly rendering the matatus useless. Some matatu operators have voluntarily decided to pull their vehicles off the road because they can hardly earn a profit as competition continues to intensify. Many passengers also favour the minibuses due to the comfort that the vehicles come with.

Besides, minibuses charge regulated fares which have worked to the disadvantage of the 14 -seaters. This has brought relief to passengers who hatve been longing for comfort and predictable bus fares. The 14 -seaters charge fares based on weather conditions and demand for the service. Minibuses are more comfortable because they are spacious and have enough legroom for relaxing.

As 14 -seater owners count their losses, the minibus owners are planning to expand to other routes to serve more commuters. Umoinner, for example, has applied for licences to serve other routes like Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Kenya Bus Services also recently started serving Pipeline Estate are as they await licences to operate in other routes. At present, many operators of PSVs are going for vehicles with at least 50 passengers capacity owing to their high profitability.

Although the minibuses seem to be doing well, they are facing some challenges. Their efforts to operate in some routes have been met with hostility, forcing them to withdraw. This is despite the fact that the matatu industry is liberalised and one can operate i. ${ }^{-7 y}$ route as long as they meet the requirements. In addition, some matatu operators feel that the 14 -seater vehicles should not be phased out entirely as they have invested a lot of money in the business. Such operators argue that minibuses cannot operate effectively in some parts of the country, hence they will not be economically viable to the owners.

General Motors, one of the leading car assembly plants in Kenya, has become the main beneficiary of the shift to minibuses due to increased orders for bigger vehicles. The rising demand for the buses has also attracted other auto dealers like Toyota Kenya which recently entered the bus assembly market. The two companies feel that there is a huge market for commercial vehicles such as pick-ups, trucks and buses. Sales of commercial and public transport vehicles account for 40 per cent of all industry deals. When the government pplicy to phase out the 14 -seater is fully implemented, demand for higher capacity vehicles is set to increase further.
