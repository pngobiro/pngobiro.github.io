                                     <li><strong>Create Rapport:</strong> Start by putting the candidate at ease with introductions and brief small talk to create a comfortable atmosphere.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Ask Open-Ended Questions:</strong> Use questions that encourage detailed responses rather than simple yes/no answers (e.g., "Tell me about a time when...").</li>

                         <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                         <div class="question-content">
                             <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.</p>
                             <div class="passage">
                                 <p>You can start a business alone and grow it into a successful enterprise. However, having a great business partner can help you achieve your goal even faster. Indeed, many of today's most successful companies are a result of powerful partnerships. Unfortunately, business partnerships are not always a success story as they can bring disaster to an enterprise. Statistics show that the divorce rate for business partnerships is 80 per cent. There are many entrepreneurs who do not make it past the initial stages of their start-ups, thanks to lack of a suitable partner. To avoid suffering the same fate, selecting the right business partner is very important.</p>
                                 <p>Before you consider having someone as your business partner, make sure that they share your vision and goals. This is because someone who shares your vision will be as dedicated as you are to the business. They will give it 100 per cent atention and put in their fair share of the work. They will also be there to weather the stormsyith you instead of quitting at the first sign of trouble. In addition, a partner who believes jinyour idea can help refine it into an even better idea. For effective assessment of the suitability of a partner, it is important to ask questions. For instance, do they believe in the idea behind the business? Where do they see themselves and the business in three years? What are their thoughts on the improvement of the business idea?</p>
                                 <p>Furthermore, when scouting for a partner, look for one who has good work ethics by studying the person's work habits. You can ask questions about when they wake up and go to sleep, how they view work, who they look up to and how they interact with support staff. This will enable you to decide whether the person will work just as hard as you on the business.</p>
                                 <p>Networking is a key element in succeeding at business. Your partner should come with a wide network of valuable connections. Such networks could lead to more customers, get you insider knowledge on sourcing for goods and provide information on where to sell goods at relatively higher prices. Your partner's networks could also lead to hiring better employees for different roles in the business. Your business partner should have great rapport with the people around him; from former colleagues to bosses, other business partners or employees. All these will go a long way in achieving business success.</p>
                                 <p>Trustworthiness is a non-negotiable quality in a business partner. The level of integrity should be so high that you are sure they would not cheat or steal from you. Trust them to always tell you the truth even when it is difficult. They should treat everyone around them fairly and not start a competing business. You should be able to trust your partner's judgement in business matters. If you have a disagreement, you should be able to trust them to handle it maturely. Experts recommend that you should know your partner for at least a year before going into business with them. This will gauge whether or not you share values that would help to steer the business in the right direction. Being friends and trusting each other is not enough.</p>
                                 <p>Your business partner should also have skills and a personality that complements yours. Partners with complementary skills are more likely to succeed. This is because the broader their range of skills, the clearer the division of labour. According to Michael Gerber in his book The E-Myth, division of labour comprises of three key roles undertaken in every business. There is the Entrepreneur who is the creative visionary, the Manager who handles administrative roles and the Technician who focuses on creating the product. Make sure that you and your partner have strengths in these areas.</p>
                                 <p>A business is fuelled by money. Without this lifeblood, a business is destined to fail. As an entrepreneur, choose a business partner who has some financial muscle. Combined with yours, the capital you bring to the business will makejit easier to achieve your business goals. Before you start, agree on how much each partnen will contribute as capital and what percentage of the business each owns. In addition, your business partner should have good credit and proper financial management history. Finally, have everything clearly stated in a signed contract.</p>

                                 <p>Selecting the right business partner is crucial for success. Ensure they share your vision and goals, demonstrating dedication and willingness to persevere through challenges. Assess their work ethic to confirm they will contribute fairly.

Trustworthiness and high integrity are non-negotiable; ensure they are honest, fair, and handle disagreements maturely. Complementary skills are vital for a clear division of labour, covering entrepreneurial, managerial, and technical roles. Finally, the partner should possess financial stability ("muscle") and a good credit history, with clear agreements on capital contributions and ownership documented in a contract.</p>
