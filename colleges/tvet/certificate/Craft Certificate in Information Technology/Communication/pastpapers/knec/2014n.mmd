The Youth Enterprise Development Fund has adopted new ways of distributing its funds. In the past, the fund was directly lending to youth through district committees. This has, however, changed as the fund is now lending money to pre-determined projects in collaboration with different industrial partners. This change was due to the recent revelations that the youth were unable to run businesses successfully. The fund managers have therefore opted for sector-specific and region-based project funding. The aim is to avoid the establishment of many similar projects which reduce the profits earned. The change will also assist the youth remain competitive by providing all the products and services required in a region.

The country has been divided into ten regions to enable the fund finance regional enterprises. The fund has also partnered with various organizations in order to assist the youth get into viable business projects. One of the organizations it has partnered with is a livestock firm in Narok County. Under this partnership, the fund will provide credit to youth who will buy livestock, fatten and sell them to the livestock firm for the export market. Already Kshs10 million has been released for the project.

The fund has also partnered with the Kenya Film Commission and the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation to provide a facility where young film makers can develop their plans into video products. The facility is located at the Multi Media University and national competitions will be run to pick groups with the best ideas. Each successful group will be loaned up to Ksh. 5 million to develop its ideas. Further, the fund has signed an agreement with Murang'a County. In the agreement, the county will provide land on which the fund will set up three sanitation blocks which will be operated by three youth groups.

The fund has, in addition, signed an agreement with the Nairobi County government. The agreement has resulted in setting up of car-wash sites, market stalls, public pay toilets, modern newspaper stands and integrated bus shelters. In an agreement with the Meru County government, the fund will build 480 market stalls which will employ 480 youth directly. The Youth Enterprise Fund has also partnered with Amiran Kenya to disburse Ksh. 150 million in pilot schemes under the Agri-vijana Loan. The facility will finance two youth groups per constituency to acquire two farmers' kits and a greenhouse kit each. The youth will also be trained on modern agriculture practices. This project is expected to create over 5,000 jobs and improve food security in the country.

The fund's change of operations is based on the poor results from a study carried out by the Centre for Development. The study, entitled "Are There Youth and Women in Kenya Ready for Business?", surveyed over 200 participants from the Youth Development Enterprise Fund. The study indicated that 61.3 per cent of women entrepreneurs and 48 per cent of the youth surveyed have less than 50 per cent likelihood of business success. The results further indicated that entrepreneurial readiness is still low in Kenya. On overage, one in every three start-up businesses fail within the first six months.

$1908 / 105$ & $1918 / 105$ & $1923 / 105$ & 6
\end{tabular}

The change in operations was also necessitated by the fact that almost half of the beneficiaries were yet to start a business, one to three months after receiving the funding. The result is that part of the initial funding is diverted to other use creating financial difficulties in financing the startup and the operations of the business. Therefore, there is serious need for financial agencies to offer broader training on skills as that will enable entrepreneurs to make the best use of the funds they receive to ensure successful businesses.
