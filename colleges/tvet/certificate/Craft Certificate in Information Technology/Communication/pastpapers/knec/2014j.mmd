14. Read the following passage and then answer the questions that follow.

Environmentalists across East Africa are concerned about the rapid destruction of Important Bird Areas (IBAs) that are of immense value to the region. These areas are visited by tourists from all over the world who love watching birds in their natural habitat. In addition, scientists carry out research on the birds which are only found in the IBAs. However, conserving these areas is facing some challenges.

Kenya's Rift Valley has always mesmerized many people due to the scenic Lake Nakuru which has always been the home of the Lesser Flamingo. The flamingos carpet the shores of the lake in their vivid pink colour which is breathtaking. In the past, the water levels in the lake would subside marking the low season and then rise to mark the high season. Several years down the line, many things have changed. The well defined high and low seasons are long gone. The lake's water levels have been falling and the flamingo numbers have continued to decrease.

The human population around the lake has increased putting a strain on the land around the lake. More buildings have been erected and farms are now close to the lake. This has resulted in pollution of the lake with raw sewage and harsh chemicals that adversely affect the Lesser Flamingos.

Lake Natron in Tanzania is another threatened wetland IBA. Three quarters of the world's Lesser Flamingos live in East Africa and they depend on the lake as a significant breeding site. There are worries that plans by the Tanzanian government to construct a road - the Serengeti Highway - close to the lake could interfere with its ecosystem. The construction of the highway could also revive plans to build a soda ash plant at the lake which would affect the flamingos.

Lutembe Bay, a wetland on the shores of Lake Victoria, is one of the most affected IBAs in Uganda. The population of migratory birds has been decreasing over the past five years. This may be attributed to habitat changes such as cultivation, real estate development and agrochemical pollution from the surrounding flower industries.

Human population encroachment, logging and deforestation remain major threats to forest IBAs. This has affected birds such as the Sokoke Owl which is only found in ArabukoSokoke forest in Malindi, Kenya, and in the East Usambara mountains of Tanzania. Human encroachment on the forest has led to unsustainable and often illegal cutting of trees for wood carvings and firewood. Since the trees are said to be the owl's preference for nests, this destruction may interfere with their breeding and lead to their eventual decline. The Arabuko-Sokoke forest is also under threat from titanium mining while gold mining is adversely affecting the East Usambara mountain in Tanzania. This affects the forests's biodiversity and the breeding areas of migratory birds.

The Murchison Falls and Lake Mburo National Parks in Uganda often experience extensive fires. Birds threatened in these areas include the Yellow-throated Long Claw, the Nubian Woodpecker and the Brown Parrot. In Kenya, the Aberdare's Cisticola birds are affected by fires possibly started by illegal honey gatherers who often burn large swathes of the Aberdare Moorlands. In addition, fires started by pastoralists to control ticks in dry seasons destroy suitable habitats for Jackson's Widowbird.

A veterinary drug know as Declofenac endangers all vulture species in East Africa. Declofenac often appeals to ranchers or animal keepers as it is inexpensive in treating fever and reducing pain in livestock. When the livestock die, their carcasses are dumped in the open where vultures feed on them. The worst crisis was witnessed in 2004 on Kenya's Kapiti Plains where nearly 200 vultures died after feeding on carcasses of animals treated with Declofenac. Since vultures feed on carcasses, they clean the environment and protect human beings from health complications associated with carrion.

In order to minimize further destruction of IBAs, there is need to allocate more funds by the East African governments for the conservation of these areas. There should also be continuous research and monitoring of different bird species and their habitats in order to guide conservation and livelihood interventions. Besides, public education on these matters needs to be intensified.

There is hope that East Africans will learn to appreciate the environment more and conserve what is left of it for future generations.
