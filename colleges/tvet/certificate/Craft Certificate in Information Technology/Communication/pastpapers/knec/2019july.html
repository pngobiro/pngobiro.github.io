                                     <p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> REPORT ON INVESTIGATION INTO PASSENGER COMPLAINTS (NAIROBI-KISUMU ROUTE)</p>

                                     <p><strong>1.0 Introduction / Terms of Reference</strong><br>
                                     Further to your request, this report details the findings of an investigation into passenger complaints regarding poor services on the Nairobi-Kisumu route over the last month. The objective was to identify the nature of the complaints and recommend improvements.</p>

                                     <p><strong>2.0 Procedure / Methodology</strong><br>
                                     The investigation involved:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Reviewing the official complaints log for the past month.</li>
                                         <li>Conducting brief, informal interviews with drivers and conductors on the route.</li>
                                         <li>Surveying a sample of passengers at the Nairobi and Kisumu terminals.</li>
                                         <li>Reviewing bus maintenance and cleaning schedules.</li>
                                         <li>Observing boarding and ticketing processes.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>3.0 Findings</strong><br>
                                     The main areas of complaint identified were:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li><strong>3.1 Delays and Scheduling:</strong> Frequent complaints about buses departing significantly later than scheduled times without adequate communication.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.2 Bus Condition:</strong> Concerns raised about the cleanliness of some buses (interiors, washrooms where applicable) and occasional mechanical issues (e.g., uncomfortable seats, rattling noises).</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.3 Staff Conduct:</strong> Some passengers reported instances of rudeness or unhelpfulness from conductors, particularly regarding luggage handling or fare queries.</li>
                                         <li><strong>3.4 Overcrowding/Booking Issues:</strong> Occasional complaints about overbooking leading to discomfort or passengers being bumped off booked trips.</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <p><strong>4.0 Conclusion</strong><br>
                                     The recent surge in complaints appears linked primarily to scheduling inconsistencies and issues with bus cleanliness/maintenance, compounded by some staff conduct problems.</p>

                                     <p><strong>5.0 Recommendations</strong><br>
                                     To address these complaints and improve service quality, the following are recommended:</p>
                                     <ol>
                                         <li><strong>Improve Schedule Adherence:</strong> Reinforce departure times with crews and implement stricter monitoring. Communicate any significant delays proactively to waiting passengers.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Enhance Cleaning & Maintenance Protocols:</strong> Implement a checklist system for pre-trip cleaning and ensure more frequent deep cleaning. Address reported mechanical issues promptly.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Customer Service Training:</strong> Conduct refresher training for conductors focusing on polite communication, conflict resolution, and efficient luggage handling.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Review Booking System:</strong> Audit the booking system to prevent overbooking and ensure seat allocation is managed effectively.</li>
                                     </ol>

                                     <p>Implementing these measures should help restore passenger confidence and improve the overall service experience on the Nairobi-Kisumu route.</p>

                         <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                         <div class="question-content">
                             <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.</p>
                             <div class="passage">
                                 <p>It is usual for people to travel to places other than their home areas during holidays. This is often in search of a conducive environment to explore, to allow them to cool down and to unwind from their normal routine. Different people have varied preferences of travel destinations. Some preferences are linked to adventure, the need to relax, a thirst for new knowledge, fun fairs and experiencing different cultures among others.</p>
                                 <p>Kenya, over the years, has been mentioned severally among the best tourist destinations across the world. In 2016 for example, Kenya was voted one of the best destinations in Africa. In the same year, the Kenya Tourism Board bagged the award for Africa's Leading Tourist Board at the World Travel Awards. Early in 2017, North American destinations experts, Goway Travel, declared Kenya as one of the "lop and upcoming" must-visit locations in the world that year.</p>
                                 <p>One of the features that make Kenya a must-visit location is its favourable cfimate which attracts all manner of tourists. Lying just across the equator, Kenya has all-year-round sunshine accompanied by cool nights and mornings. Whether travelling early or late in the year, the country's climate is favourable for all vacation-related activities. To accommodate all the visiting tourists, the country offers accommodation in all its major towns for business tourists. It also offers accommodation in all parks for game lovers and in the coastal area for murine lovers in form of hotels, lodges and resorts. All these hospitality facilities provide a variety of international cuisines.</p>
                                 <p>Kenya is rich in game parks and reserves that offer a variety of wild animals to see thereby giving game lovers a memorable wildife experience. Kenya is home to the big five; the elephant, the black rhinoceros, the buffalo, the lion and the leopard. Tourists, both local and international, are assured of good times watching animals by taking game drives in the early mornings and late evenings. In addition, Kenya also gives prized experiences such as watching the famous wildebeest migrations down at the Mara.</p>
                                 <p>For marine life adventures, Kenya provides the best spot to visit as it has the Kenya Barrier Reef. At over 140 miles long, it is the world's second longest coral reef. Kenya's coastline is also dotted with sand beaches for all kinds of adventures. From diving to snorkelling, scuba diving and even building sand castles, Kenya's coast is definitely a place to visit. For those with an interest in archaeological facts, Kenya offers a variety of destinations. These include Kariandusi Prehistoric Site, Gedi Ruins, Shimoni Slave Caves, Fort Jesus, Mombasa Old Town, Olorgesailie Prehistoric Site, and Hell's Gate National Park among others. All these sites allow a holiday maker to experience, first hand, the rich African heritage.</p>
                                 <p>For mountain climbers, Kenya is home to Mount Kenya ( $5,199 \mathrm{~m}$ high) the second-highest mountain in Africa after Kilimanjaro, lying across the equator in a sunny environment. Mount Kenya is attractive to climbers due to its snow-capped peak and its variety of flora and fauna which change with altitude. As the climbers go up the mountain, they are able to see a variety of the endangered species such as the Sunni buck.</p>
                                 <p>One holiday stop in Kenya allows the tourists to meet and mingle with different people from different parts of the country with diverse cultures and heritage. For anyone looking for a cultural experience, close interactions with the Maasai, Samburu, Swahili, Turkana, Pokot, El Molo, Rendile and others will be a totally worthwhile experience. Being hospitable, these tribes mingle freely with visitors allowing them to get a taste of the Kenyan heritage.</p>
                                 <p>One of the major problems that tourists across the worid face is lack of easy access to their desired destinations. In Kenya, the experience is different. This is because Kenyan authorities introduced an e-visa system in 2015. This system has since eased entry for willing tourists as it is cheap to acquire. It costs $\$ 50$ per person and eliminates the need for bulky entry documentation.</p>
