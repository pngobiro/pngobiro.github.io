                     <div class="question" id="question-14">
                         <h3>Question 14 (18 marks)</h3>
                         <div class="question-content">
                             <p>Read the passage below and then answer the questions that follow.</p>
                             <div class="passage">
                                 <p>Real estate is probably the largest investment in the portfolio of every family. In many parts of the world, this is reinforced by the fact that houses appreciate up to 50 times over a period of 20 years. Land appreciates in value simply because it is limited in supply. Hence, as the population increases, so does the demand for land, which drives its price up over time. Appreciation in a property's value can be caused by several factors that an investor should be aware of.</p>
                                 <p>The availability of amenities is what makes an area attractive and desirable to potential property buyers. People buying homes for their own use will be drawn by the development of new infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, shopping malls, airports and increased public transport facilities in a particular area. The value of property in these areas keeps on increasing if there are visible developments. This is also why serviced plots that have access to water, electricity and other amenities are priced higher than regular plots. Their availability impacts on the livability of the area.</p>
                                 <p>Once a location becomes popular with residents, it becomes a favorite place for several social activities. Hobby classes and restaurants start operating in the area to serve the lifestyles of many people. Hence, the propertics in these residential areas start trading at a premium. The more developed a location becomes, the more people want to live in it and the more prices continue to rise.</p>
                                 <p>With population increase and the growth of urban areas, land that had previously been marked for agricultural purposes is being transformed to commercial and residential use. When utility of land changes from agricultural to commercial or residential use, its value increases. This is because agricultural land is generally of lower value.</p>
                                 <p>Interest rates and general inflation fluctuations have a major impact on the real estate markets. These fluctuations greatly influence a person's ability to purchase a residential property. Low interest rates on mortgage loans translate to an excess of money in supply which can fuel the demand for home ownership as loans become cheaper. Being a free market driven by the forces of demand and supply, the high demand will result in rising property prices. Additionally, the strength of the overall economy significantly impacts the real estate market. This is because a consumer's ability to purchase a house largely depends on key factors like gross domestic product (GDP) and income growth. Where these factors are positive, the price of houses goes up.</p>
                                 <p>Still on the demand and supply factor, people will want to live in places near their areas of work. In urban areas, residential areas that are located near places of work have a high demand among the working class which in turn drives up the prices for rental units. Proximity to the workplace coupled with availability of basic amenities in areas where the cost of living is low are very attractive to the middle and lower class.</p>
                                 <p>In real estate, the physical structure incurs maintenance costs while depreciating in value over time. To cater for this, investors should consider how land appreciation can offset the depreciation of a home. A developer can actively deploy some interventions to increase the value of the property. These may include modifications like adding an extra room or modernizing the structure to current market standards and thus fetch more returns.</p>
                                 <p>Understanding the key factors that drive the real estate market is essential. This enables a potential investor to do a comprehensive evaluation before making the decision to purchase. This ensures that the decision made after the evaluation can stand the test of time. This way, the investor enjoys the fruits of his investment for a lifetime.</p>

                                 <p>Property value appreciation is driven by several factors. The development of amenities like hospitals, schools, malls, and transport infrastructure makes an area desirable, increasing property values. Popular locations attract social activities and businesses, trading at a premium as demand grows. Changing land use from agricultural to commercial or residential significantly increases its value. Economic factors play a major role; low interest rates make loans cheaper, boosting demand and prices, while overall economic strength (GDP, income growth) also positively impacts the market. Proximity to workplaces, especially coupled with amenities and lower living costs, drives demand for rental units. Finally, developers can actively increase value through property modifications and modernization.</p>
