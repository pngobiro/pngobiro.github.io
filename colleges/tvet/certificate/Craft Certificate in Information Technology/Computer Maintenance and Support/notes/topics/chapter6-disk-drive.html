                        <p>A hard disk drive (HDD) is a data storage device used for storing and retrievingdigital information using rapidly rotating discs (platters) coated with magnetic material. An HDD retains its data even when powered off. Data is read in a random-accessmanner, meaning individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than just sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid ("hard") rapidly rotating discs (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces.</p>

                            <p>The factors that limit the time to access the data on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads. Seek time is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data.</p>

                            <p>Faster seek rates typically require more energy usage to quickly move the heads across the platter, causing loud noises from the pivot bearing and greater device vibrations as the heads are rapidly accelerated during the start of the seek motion and decelerated at the end of the seek motion.</p>

                            <p>Latency is the delay for the rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the readwrite mechanism. It depends on rotational speed of a disk, measured in revolutions per minute (rpm).</p>

                            <p>This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for <span class="math-inline">\(10,000-\mathrm{rpm}\)</span> drives.</p>

                             <p>The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like EIA-422.

                        <p><strong>Role and Subsystems:</strong> The hard disk is a key component in the storage subsystem. It plays an important role in the performance, capacity and software support of the PC. Its quality and reliability is probably more important than that of any other component</p>
                        <p><strong>Related Components:</strong> The hard disk must be matched to several other components in the system. First, it must be of a form factor compatible with the system case. Second, it must use the same interface as the controller or controllers within the PC.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Compatibility Selection Criteria:</strong> There are several important criteria to keep in mind when selecting a hard disk to suit your system, but most systems use standard hardware, making it actually fairly easy to find hardware that will suit your needs:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Form Factor:</strong> Hard disks come in several different common sizes, matched to the bays in the system case where they are installed.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Interface Type:</strong> Most hard drives use the IDE/ATA interface; others, especially in high-end systems, use the SCSI interface.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Spindle Speed Support and Cooling:</strong> Some high-speed drives generate a significant amount of heat and may require special cooling. Some system cases, especially smaller ones, may not be able to use these faster drives without problems. Fortunately most newer drives have largely addressed these heat issues.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Performance and Capacity Selection Criteria:</strong> There are many different performance issues related to hard disks. I discuss them in gory detail here, but for selecting a new hard drive I can boil the capacity and performance issues down to the following key points:

                                    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Obviously, the size of the drive is an important consideration: bigger drives hold more. At the same time, don't overspend on an enormous drive unless you do a lot of downloading or working with large graphics, audio and video files.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Spindle Speed:</strong> One of the most important differentiators between different drive models from a performance standpoint is the speed at which the spindle spins (and thus the data platters as well).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Seek Time:</strong> This specification, given in milliseconds, refers to how quickly the hard disk's actuator (the device that moves the head assembly) can position the heads to a random place on the surface of the disk platters.</li>
