                                        Some electronic mail systems are confined to a single computer system or network, but others have gateways to other computer systems, enabling users to send electronic mail anywhere in the<br>
                                        world. Companies that are fully computerized make extensive use of e-mail because it is fast, flexible, and reliable.
