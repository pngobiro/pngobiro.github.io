                        <p>A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic boardor colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.</p>

                        <p><strong>CPU</strong> - The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often seen in the motherboard as it is the main core of every computer. All arrangement, calculation and control happen here.</p>
                        <p><strong>BIOS</strong> - BIOS means Basic Input Output System which is a non-volatile memory that includes configuration details about the computer. It includes all the system required for the CPU to converse with the keyboard, mouse video display, hard drives and also other connections devices. When a PC is power-driven on it uses the BIOS 'boot code' set up much essential task that gets the Computer to a point where it is set to work.</p>
                        <p><strong>RTC</strong> - RTC means Real Time Clock or it is mostly called as CMOS chip which maintains the date, day and time in a 24 hour format just like your watch. The computer uses this clock to 'time<br>stamp' files as they are produced and customized. Whenever the user print a file it time stamps the pages as they are printed.</p> <!-- Added <br> based on MMD line break -->

                        <p><strong>Power</strong> - A 20 or 24 pin connector is being connected to the ATX connector to accept a plug from the power supply. This plug carries DC power to all the circuits on the motherboard.</p>
                        <p><strong>Keyboard</strong> - A Mini-din 6-pin purple color round connector found at the back of the motherboard is the connector where keyboard is being plugged in.</p>

                        <p><strong>Display</strong> - This connector is not included into the motherboard but is built-in in this list since its task is very compulsory. It is a 15-pin, D-shell type connector specially found on a video card which the user have to install into the AGP connector of the motherboard which is in brown color and as today the motherboard are being highly developed and the VGA connectors are also inbuilt available in the motherboard and the even the AGP slots are being replaced by PCI Express slots which are being denoted in white color.</p>
                        <p><strong>IDE</strong> - The IDE are termed as Integrated Drive Electronics. These are 40 pin connectors that make available a place to connect the ribbon cables from the hard drives and also the CD or DVD ROM drive. All data among the motherboard and the drives is being passing on through these cables.</p>

                        <p>Well, of course, after the discussion that we had above, you must be wondering how to determine a motherboard type.

                            <p>This way of differentiating computer motherboards is based on motherboard socket types. In short, the CPUs that are available in the current market are compatible to specific motherboards.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The motherboard is the backbone of your desktop computer. All of your components plug into the motherboard, so ensuring that you install it correctly is the first step towards building your own computer or upgrading an old one. Read on after the jump to get a new motherboard installed in your computer case in just a few minutes.</p>
                        <h4 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span class="heading-icon">üìù</span><span class="heading-text">Steps</span></h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open your computer case. Remove both side panels for easy access to the motherboard tray.</li>
                            <li>Ground yourself. Before you begin working on the interior of your computer or handling the motherboard, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have.</li>
                            <li>Replace the I/O panel shield. This is located at the rear of the case, where the connectors for the motherboard extend out for your monitor, USB devices, and other peripherals.</li>
                            <li>Find the standoffs. Standoffs keep the motherboard above the case. This prevents it from shorting out and helps cooling. Some cases will come with standoffs, while others do not. Your motherboard should come with its own standoffs as well that you can use.</li>
                            <li>Install the standoffs. Match the holes on the motherboard with the available standoff locations on the motherboard tray. Every case and motherboard tray is different, and all will have different hole configurations.</li>
                            <li>Place your motherboard on the standoffs. The holes and the standoffs should all line up. If your motherboard tray does not come out of the case, you may need to gently force the motherboard against the I/O panel on the back of the case to fit it.</li>
                            <li>Install your components. Before reinserting the motherboard tray with the newlyfastened motherboard into the case, install your CPU, CPU cooler, and RAM.</li>
                            <li>Connect the power supply. Once the motherboard is secured, you can start connecting your components to it. It is recommended that you connect the power supply first, as the plugs will be difficult to reach later.</li>
                            <li>Connect your front panel. In order to turn on your computer with the front power button or see when the hard drive is being accessed, you will need to connect the front panel switches and indicators. Locate the following wires and connect them to the appropriate pins on the motherboard:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-left: 20px;"> <!-- Nested list for front panel items -->

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Connect the front USB ports. Connect any front USB ports to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. These are typically labeled. Make sure the correct plugs are placed on the correct pints.</li>
                            <li>Connect the fans. Connect any case and CPU fans to the appropriate pins on the motherboard. There are typically several places to plug in chassis fans, as well as a twopin connector near the CPU for the CPU fan.</li>
                            <li>Install your drives. Once the motherboard is secure and connected, you can start attaching your drives to it. Make sure that you attach your SATA hard drives and optical drives to the correct SATA ports on your motherboard.</li>
                            <li>Install a video card. One of the last components you should install is the video card. The card will take up the most space, and will make reaching other areas difficult. Installing a video card may be optional, depending on your system and needs.</li>
                            <li>Adjust your wiring. Now that everything is connected to your motherboard, it's time to move that wiring around so that heat doesn't get trapped or wires don't get stuck in fans. Tuck excess cable into spare drive bays and use zip ties to bundle cables together. Make sure that all of your components have room to breathe. <sup>[3]</sup></li> <!-- Using sup for footnote marker -->
                            <li>Close up the computer. Return the side panels of the case to their original positions and screw them back in. Plug your computer and components in. Turn your computer on and prepare for operating system installation. Follow the guides below for specific instructions for your operating system:</li>
