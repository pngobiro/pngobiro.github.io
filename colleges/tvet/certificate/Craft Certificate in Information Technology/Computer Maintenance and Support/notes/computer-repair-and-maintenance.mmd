PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

\section*{CHAPTER ONE}

\section*{BASIC COMPUTER CONCEPT}

Major Components found in the motherboard
CPU - The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often seen in the motherboard as it is the main core of every computer. All arrangement, calculation and control happen here.

BIOS - BIOS means Basic Input Output System which is a non-volatile memory that includes configuration details about the computer. It includes all the system required for the CPU to converse with the keyboard, mouse video display, hard drives and also other connections devices. When a PC is power-driven on it uses the BIOS 'boot code' set up much essential task that gets the Computer to a point where it is set to work.

RTC - RTC means Real Time Clock or it is mostly called as CMOS chip which maintains the date, day and time in a 24 hour format just like your watch. The computer uses this clock to 'time stamp' files as they are produced and customized. Whenever the user print a file it time stamps the pages as they are printed.

ChipSet - These are big chip(s) that combine many tasks which are used to create in split into smaller chips on the motherboard. As they save lots of space and cost.

The task completed by these chipsets frequently not working into two strategy with one if an interface from the CPU to the memory and the other providing controllers for IDE, ISA, PCI and USB devices.

\section*{Primary Connectors found on the motherboard are:}

Power - A 20 or 24 pin connector is being connected to the ATX connector to accept a plug from the power supply. This plug carries DC power to all the circuits on the motherboard.

Keyboard - A Mini-din 6-pin purple color round connector found at the back of the motherboard is the connector where keyboard is being plugged in.

Mouse - A Mini-din 6-pin green color round connector is just next to the keyboard connector and the mouse is being plugged in.

Display - This connector is not included into the motherboard but is built-in in this list since its task is very compulsory. It is a 15-pin, D-shell type connector specially found on a video card which the user have to install into the AGP connector of the motherboard which is in brown color and as today the motherboard are being highly developed and the VGA connectors are also inbuilt available in the motherboard and the even the AGP slots are being replaced by PCI Express slots which are being denoted in white color.

IDE - The IDE are termed as Integrated Drive Electronics. These are 40 pin connectors that make available a place to connect the ribbon cables from the hard drives and also the CD or DVD ROM drive. All data among the motherboard and the drives is being passing on through these cables.

FDD connector - It is like function to the IDE connector. It is a 34 pin ribbon connector that passes data among the motherboard and any floppy drive installed in the Computer. And the connector is in white color.

DRAM - DRAM consists of Dynamic Random Access Memory connectors especially for SIMM and DIMM type of memory modules. And confirm before installing the RAM whether the motherboard supports the DDR1 or the DDR2 memory module.

\section*{Serial Connectors:}

Standard Serial Connector - This connector has been about in PCs since they first appeared. It was initially located on ISA expansion type cards. Nowadays it is an essential part of latest motherboards. It is a 9- pin, D-shell connector that agrees to you to connect external devices with serial ports to your PC. The maximum data rate is $115 \mathrm{~KB} / \mathrm{s}$.
USB - Universal Serial Bus -This is a comparatively new serial bus. Formerly specific as low speed, $1.2 \mathrm{Mb} / \mathrm{s}$, it was improved to full speed, $12 \mathrm{Mb} / \mathrm{s}$. The latest version 2.0 is specified as high speed of more than $400 \mathrm{MB} / \mathrm{s}$.

\section*{Parallel Connectors:}

SCSI - The SCSI is being termed as Small Computer System Interface which sends the data at a maximum speed of up to $80 \mathrm{Mb} / \mathrm{s}$. It not included into most computer motherboards. It can be installed in a computer in a form of Expansion card. With the help of this card the user can connect around seven hard drives in one computer.

Expansion Card Connectors - The CPU is being connected to expansion card connectors through one of the chip set ICs mentioned above. They are situated on the motherboard near the back of the computer. These connectors permit special utility cards to plug into and work with the computer.

Before motherboards incorporated the serial and centronix connectors were found on expansion boards that plugged into ISA slots.

\section*{Most PCs have the following expansion connector types:}

PCI - The PCI is termed as Peripheral Component Interconnect which is a recent and quicker interface which accepts all expansion cards that have a PCI interface.

\section*{Basic Electrical Components}

There are several important basic electrical components that are commonly found in the circuits of virtually all PC parts and peripherals \{power supply unit\}. These devices are the fundamental building blocks of electrical and electronic circuits, and can be found in great numbers on motherboards, hard disk logic boards, video cards and just about everywhere else in the PC, including places that might surprise you.

Battery: A direct current electricity source of a specific voltage, used primarily in small circuits.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-05.jpg?height=432&width=766&top_left_y=895&top_left_x=674)

A battery (in this case, a button cell on a PC motherboard.)
- Resistor: As you could probably guess from the name, a resistor increases the resistance of a circuit. The main purpose of this is to reduce the flow of electricity in a circuit. Resistors come in all different shapes and sizes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-05.jpg?height=386&width=895&top_left_y=1729&top_left_x=615)

Magnified surface-mount resistor from a motherboard.
These small resistors are now much more common on
PC
electronics than the older, larger pin type.

\section*{Note the "R10" designation.}
- Capacitor: A capacitor is a component made from two (or two sets of) conductive plates with an insulator between them. The insulator prevents the plates from touching
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-06.jpg?height=624&width=893&top_left_y=504&top_left_x=608)
- Inductor: An inductor is essentially a coil of wire. When current flows through an inductor, a magnetic field is created, and the inductor will store this magnetic energy until it is released. In some ways, an inductor is the opposite of a capacitor. While a capacitor stores voltage as electrical energy, an inductor stores current as magnetic energy.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-06.jpg?height=652&width=543&top_left_y=1536&top_left_x=772)
- Transformer: A transformer is an inductor, usually with an iron core, that has two lengths of wire wrapped around it instead of one. The two coils of wire do not electrically connect, and are normally attached to different circuits. One of the most important components in the world of power, it is used to change one AC voltage into another. As described above, when a coil has a
current passed through it, a magnetic field is set up proportional to the number of turns in the coil. This principle also works in reverse: if you create a magnetic field in a coil, a current will be induced in it, proportional to the number of turns of the coil.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-07.jpg?height=394&width=969&top_left_y=470&top_left_x=578)

A transformer from the interior of a PC power supply.
Note the large heat sink fins above and below it.
- Diode / LED: A diode is a device, typically made from semiconductor material, that restricts the flow of current in a circuit to only one direction; it will block the bulk of any current that tries to go "against the flow" in a wire. Diodes have a multitude of uses. For example, they are often used in circuits that convert alternating current to direct current, since they can block half the alternating current from passing through.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-07.jpg?height=722&width=950&top_left_y=1425&top_left_x=395)
- Fuse: A fuse is a device designed to protect other components from accidental damage due to excessive current flowing through them. Each type of fuse is designed for a specific amount of current. As long as the current in the circuit is kept below this value, the fuse passes the current
with little opposition. If the current rises above the rating of the fuse--due to a malfunction of some sort or an accidental short-circuit--the fuse will "blow" and disconnect the circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_20202ff67463e78b0fc3g-08.jpg?height=380&width=692&top_left_y=393&top_left_x=700)

A fuse, sitting in its fuse holder, from the interior of a PC power supply.
- Jumper: The jumper itself is a small piece of plastic and metal that is placed across two jumper pins to make a connection, or removed to break a connection. They come in a few standard sizes (and some non-standard ones I'm sure); only one or two sizes are commonly seen on PCs. Jumpers are sometimes also called shunts.

\section*{CHAPTER TWO}

\section*{POWER SUPPLY}

A power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. The primary function of a power supply is to convert one form of electrical energy to another. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are discrete, stand-alone devices, whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices.

Every power supply must obtain the energy it supplies to its load, as well as any energy it consumes while performing that task, from an energy source. Depending on its design, a power supply may obtain energy from various types of energy sources, including electrical energy transmission systems, energy storage devices such as a batteries and fuel cells, electromechanical systems such as generators and alternators, solar power converters, or another power supply. All power supplies have a power input, which receives energy from the energy source, and a power output that delivers energy to the load. In most power supplies the power input and output
consist of electrical connectors or hardwired circuit connections, though some power supplies employ wireless energy transfer in lieu of galvanic connections for the power input or output.

\section*{Types}

\section*{DC power supply}

A DC power supply is one that supplies a constant DC voltage to its load. Depending on its design, a DC power supply may be powered from a DC source or from an AC source such as the power mains.
Some DC power supplies use AC mains electricity as an energy source. Such power supplies will sometimes employ a transformer to convert the input voltage to a higher or lower AC voltage. A rectifier is used to convert the transformer output voltage to a varying DC voltage, which in turn is passed through an electronic filter to convert it to an unregulated DC voltage.

\section*{AC power supplies}

An AC power supply typically takes the voltage from a wall outlet (mains supply) and lowers it to the desired voltage. Some filtering may take place as well.
In modern use, AC power supplies can be divided into single phase and three phase systems.
"The primary difference between single phase and three phase AC power is the constancy of delivery."

\section*{Uninterruptible power supply}

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) takes its power from two or more sources simultaneously. It is usually powered directly from the AC mains, while simultaneously charging a storage battery. Should there be a dropout or failure of the mains, the battery instantly takes over so that the load never experiences an interruption. In a computer installation, this gives the operators time to shut down the system in an orderly way.

\section*{Power Supply Specification}

The suitability of a particular power supply for an application is determined by various attributes of the power supply, which are typically listed in the power supply's specification. Commonly specified attributes for a power supply include:
- Input voltage type (AC or DC) and range
- Efficiency of power conversion
- The amount of voltage and current it can supply to its load
- How stable its output voltage or current is under varying line and load conditions
- How long it can supply energy without refueling or recharging (applies to power supplies that employ portable energy sources)
- Operating and storage temperature ranges

\section*{The power supply connectors}

\section*{4 Pin Berg Connector}

\section*{Common Power Problems}

Here are some of the most common power supply problems and their likely effect on sensitive equipment:

\section*{Power Surges}

A power surge takes place when the voltage is $110 \%$ or more above normal. The most common cause is heavy electrical equipment being turned off. Under these conditions, computer systems and other high tech equipment can experience flickering lights, equipment shutoff, errors or memory loss.

Possible Solutions: Surge Suppressors, Voltage Regulators, Uninterruptable Power Supplies,

\section*{High-Voltage Spikes}

High-voltage spikes occur when there is a sudden voltage peak of up to 6,000 volts. These spikes are usually the result of nearby lightning strikes, but there can be other causes as well. The effects on vulnerable electronic systems can include loss of data and burned circuit boards. Possible Solutions: Surge Suppressors, Voltage Regulators, Uninterruptable Power Supplies, Power Conditioners

\section*{Frequency Variation}

A frequency variation involves a change in frequency from the normally stable utility frequency of 50 or 60 Hz , depending on your geographic location. This may be caused by erratic operation of emergency generators or unstable frequency power sources. For sensitive equipment, the results can be data loss, program failure, equipment lock-up or complete shut down. Possible Solutions: Voltage Regulators, Power Conditioners

\section*{Power Sag}

A sag is the reduction of AC Voltage at a given frequency for the duration of 0.5 cycles to 1 minute's time. Sages are usually caused by system faults, and often the result of switching on loads with high demand startup currents. For more details about power sags visit our newsletter archives.
Possibile Solutions: $\underline{\text { Voltage Regulators, } \underline{\text { Uninterruptable Power Supplies, }} \text { Power Conditioners }}$ Electrical Line Noise

Electrical line noise is defined as Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and causes unwanted effects in the circuits of computer systems. Sources of the problems include motors, relays, motor control devices, broadcast transmissions, microwave radiation, and distant electrical storms. RFI, EMI and other frequency problems can cause equipment to lock-up, and data error or loss.
Possible Solutions: Voltage Regulators, Uninterruptable Power Supplies, $\underline{\text { Power Conditioners }}$

\section*{Brownouts}

A brownout is a steady lower voltage state. An example of a brownout is what happens during peak electrical demand in the summer, when utilities can't always meet the requirements and must lower the voltage to limit maximum power. When this happens, systems can experience glitches, data loss and equipment failure.

\section*{Blackouts}

A power failure or blackout is a zero-voltage condition that lasts for more than two cycles. It may be caused by tripping a circuit breaker, power distribution failure or utility power failure. A blackout can cause data loss or corruption and equipment damage.

PossibLe Solutions: Generators

\section*{CHAPTER THREE}

\section*{MOTHERBOARD}

A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic boardor colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.

\section*{Design}

A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices.

\section*{Major Components found in the motherboard are:}

CPU - The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often seen in the motherboard as it is the main core of every computer. All arrangement, calculation and control happen here.

BIOS - BIOS means Basic Input Output System which is a non-volatile memory that includes configuration details about the computer. It includes all the system required for the CPU to converse with the keyboard, mouse video display, hard drives and also other connections devices. When a PC is power-driven on it uses the BIOS 'boot code' set up much essential task that gets the Computer to a point where it is set to work.

RTC - RTC means Real Time Clock or it is mostly called as CMOS chip which maintains the date, day and time in a 24 hour format just like your watch. The computer uses this clock to 'time
stamp' files as they are produced and customized. Whenever the user print a file it time stamps the pages as they are printed.

ChipSet - These are big chip(s) that combine many tasks which are used to create in split into smaller chips on the motherboard. As they save lots of space and cost.

\section*{Primary Connectors found on the motherboard are:}

Power - A 20 or 24 pin connector is being connected to the ATX connector to accept a plug from the power supply. This plug carries DC power to all the circuits on the motherboard.

Keyboard - A Mini-din 6-pin purple color round connector found at the back of the motherboard is the connector where keyboard is being plugged in.

Mouse - A Mini-din 6-pin green color round connector is just next to the keyboard connector and the mouse is being plugged in.

Display - This connector is not included into the motherboard but is built-in in this list since its task is very compulsory. It is a 15-pin, D-shell type connector specially found on a video card which the user have to install into the AGP connector of the motherboard which is in brown color and as today the motherboard are being highly developed and the VGA connectors are also inbuilt available in the motherboard and the even the AGP slots are being replaced by PCI Express slots which are being denoted in white color.

\section*{Types of Computer Motherboards}

Well, of course, after the discussion that we had above, you must be wondering how to determine a motherboard type. But before starting off with this process of describing the computer motherboard type, we need to understand, what are the different ways of classifying or rather differentiating computer main-boards.

\section*{Classification on the Basis of Type of Processor}

This way of differentiating computer motherboards is based on motherboard socket types. In short, the CPUs that are available in the current market are compatible to specific motherboards.

\section*{Socket A Motherboards}

These motherboards are meant for the AMD and Durons processors. The Socket A motherboard is also known as Socket 464 motherboard. The CPU socket in the motherboard has 462 pins and it comes in a PGA (Pin Grid Array) packaging.

\section*{Socket 378 Motherboards}

This type of motherboard is meant for the Pentium 4 processors. It also comes in a PGA package and has 478 pins.

\section*{Socket T Motherboards}

Also known as LGA 775, this type of motherboard is meant for Intel Core 2 Duo, Intel Core 2 Quad and Inel Xeon processor. Of course, this motherboard can also support other Intel processors such as the Celeron, P-4, Pentium D, Celeron D and Pentium XE processor. Its specifications include 775 pins and a very high bus speed of 1600 MHz . It also comes in a

\section*{Motherboard Type Based on Dimensions}

The dimensions of a motherboard, also known as the form factor, is another way of distinguishing between the different motherboard types. The different types of motherboards based on this form factor can be listed as under.

\section*{ATX Motherboards}

The ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) motherboard has a length of 12 inches and a width of 7.5 inches.

\section*{Full AT Motherboards}

This was the first type of motherboard, which were 12 inches wide and 11 inches long. This motherboard suffered from a lot of problems like access to components was cumbersome and most importantly, the heating problem.

Baby AT Motherboards

With a dimension of 10 by 8.5 inches, this motherboard is meant for the classic Pentium processors. The DIN keyboard connector at the top right corner of this motherboard makes recognizing this motherboard a relatively simple task.

\section*{How to Install a Motherboard}

The motherboard is the backbone of your desktop computer. All of your components plug into the motherboard, so ensuring that you install it correctly is the first step towards building your own computer or upgrading an old one. Read on after the jump to get a new motherboard installed in your computer case in just a few minutes.

\section*{Steps}
1. Open your computer case. Remove both side panels for easy access to the motherboard tray.
2. Ground yourself. Before you begin working on the interior of your computer or handling the motherboard, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have.
3. Replace the I/O panel shield. This is located at the rear of the case, where the connectors for the motherboard extend out for your monitor, USB devices, and other peripherals.
4. Find the standoffs. Standoffs keep the motherboard above the case. This prevents it from shorting out and helps cooling. Some cases will come with standoffs, while others do not. Your motherboard should come with its own standoffs as well that you can use.
5. Install the standoffs. Match the holes on the motherboard with the available standoff locations on the motherboard tray. Every case and motherboard tray is different, and all will have different hole configurations.
6. Place your motherboard on the standoffs. The holes and the standoffs should all line up. If your motherboard tray does not come out of the case, you may need to gently force the motherboard against the I/O panel on the back of the case to fit it.
7. Install your components. Before reinserting the motherboard tray with the newlyfastened motherboard into the case, install your CPU, CPU cooler, and RAM.
8. Connect the power supply. Once the motherboard is secured, you can start connecting your components to it. It is recommended that you connect the power supply first, as the plugs will be difficult to reach later.
9. Connect your front panel. In order to turn on your computer with the front power button or see when the hard drive is being accessed, you will need to connect the front panel switches and indicators. Locate the following wires and connect them to the appropriate pins on the motherboard:

Power switch
Reset switch
Power LED
Hard drive (HDD) LED
Speaker
10. Connect the front USB ports. Connect any front USB ports to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. These are typically labeled. Make sure the correct plugs are placed on the correct pints.
11. Connect the fans. Connect any case and CPU fans to the appropriate pins on the motherboard. There are typically several places to plug in chassis fans, as well as a twopin connector near the CPU for the CPU fan.
12. Install your drives. Once the motherboard is secure and connected, you can start attaching your drives to it. Make sure that you attach your SATA hard drives and optical drives to the correct SATA ports on your motherboard.
13. Install a video card. One of the last components you should install is the video card. The card will take up the most space, and will make reaching other areas difficult. Installing a video card may be optional, depending on your system and needs.
14. Adjust your wiring. Now that everything is connected to your motherboard, it's time to move that wiring around so that heat doesn't get trapped or wires don't get stuck in fans. Tuck excess cable into spare drive bays and use zip ties to bundle cables together. Make sure that all of your components have room to breathe. ${ }^{[3]}$
15. Close up the computer. Return the side panels of the case to their original positions and screw them back in. Plug your computer and components in. Turn your computer on and prepare for operating system installation. Follow the guides below for specific instructions for your operating system:

\section*{CHAPTER FOUR}

\section*{MICROPROCESSOR}

A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital-integrated circuit which accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.

\section*{Computer Processor Types}

A few years ago, choosing a processor was pretty straightforward. AMD and Intel each produced two series of processors, a mainstream line and a budget line. Each company used only one processor socket, and there was a limited range of processor speeds available. If you wanted an Intel processor, you might have a dozen mainstream models and a half-dozen budget models to choose among. The same was true of AMD.

\section*{AMD Sempron}

The various models of the AMD Sempron processor .AMD actually packages two different processors under the Sempron name. A Socket A Sempron, also called a $K 7$ Sempron, is in fact a re-badged Athlon XP processor.

\section*{Intel Celeron}

Intel introduced their Celeron D models, which are now available for Socket 478 and Socket 775 motherboards.

\section*{Intel Pentium 4}

The Pentium 4, is available in Socket 478 and Socket 775. Unlike AMD which sometimes uses the same Athlon 64 model number to designate four or more different processors with different clock speeds, L2 cache sizes,

\section*{CHAPTER FIVE}

\section*{COMPUTER MEMORY}

\section*{The Role of Memory}

The term "memory" applies to any electronic component capable of temporarily storing data. There are two main categories of memories:
- internal memory that temporarily memorises data while programs are running. Internal memory uses microconductors, i.e. fast specialized electronic circuits. Internal memory corresponds to what we call random access memory (RAM).
- auxiliary memory (also called physical memory or external memory) that stores information over the long term, including after the computer is turned off. Auxiliary memory corresponds to magnetic storage devices such as the hard drive, optical storage devices such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs, as well as read-only memories.

\section*{Technical Characteristics}

The main characteristics of a memory are:
- Capacity, representing the global volume of information (in bits) that the memory can store
- Access time, corresponding to the time interval between the read/write request and the availability of the data
- Cycle time, representing the minimum time interval between two successive accesses
- Throughput, which defines the volume of information exchanged per unit of time, expressed in bits per second
- Non-volatility, which characterises the ability of a memory to store data when it is not being supplied with electricity

The ideal memory has a large capacity with restricted access time and cycle time, a high throughput and is non-volatile.

However, fast memories are also the most expensive. This is why memories that use different technologies are used in a computer, interfaced with each other and organized hierarchically. The fastest memories are located in small numbers close to the processor. Auxiliary memories, which are not as fast, are used to store information permanently.

\section*{Types of Memories}

\section*{Random Access Memory}

Random access memory, generally called RAM is the system's main memory, i.e. it is a space that allows you to temporarily store data when a program is running.

Unlike data storage on an auxiliary memory such as a hard drive, RAM is volatile, meaning that it only stores data as long as it supplied with electricity. Thus, each time the computer is turned off, all the data in the memory are irremediably erased.

\section*{Read-Only Memory}

Read-only memory, called ROM, is a type of memory that allows you to keep the information contained on it even when the memory is no longer receiving electricity. Basically, this type of memory only has read-only access. However, it is possible to save information in some types of ROM memory.

\section*{Flash Memory}

Flash memory is a compromise between RAM-type memories and ROM memories. Flash memory possesses the non-volatility of ROM memories while providing both read and write access However, the access times of flash memories are longer than the access times of RAM.

\section*{CHAPTER SIX}

\section*{DISK DRIVE}

A hard disk drive (HDD) is a data storage device used for storing and retrievingdigital information using rapidly rotating discs (platters) coated with magnetic material. An HDD retains its data even when powered off. Data is read in a random-accessmanner, meaning individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than just sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid ("hard") rapidly rotating discs (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces.

\section*{Disk Performance characteristics}

\section*{Time to access data}

The factors that limit the time to access the data on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads. Seek time is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data.

\section*{Seek time}

Faster seek rates typically require more energy usage to quickly move the heads across the platter, causing loud noises from the pivot bearing and greater device vibrations as the heads are rapidly accelerated during the start of the seek motion and decelerated at the end of the seek motion.

\section*{Latency}

Latency is the delay for the rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the readwrite mechanism. It depends on rotational speed of a disk, measured in revolutions per minute (rpm).

\section*{Data transfer rate}

This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for $10,000-\mathrm{rpm}$ drives.

\section*{ACCESS AND INTERFACES}

\section*{Hard Disk Drive Interface}

Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE),
later standardized under the name AT Attachment (ATA, The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16 bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the HDD

\section*{Serial ATA (SATA).}

The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like EIA-422. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar differential signaling system is used in RS485, LocalTalk, USB, FireWire, and differential SCSI.

\section*{Factors in selecting drives}

Role and Subsystems: The hard disk is a key component in the storage subsystem. It plays an important role in the performance, capacity and software support of the PC. Its quality and reliability is probably more important than that of any other component Related Components: The hard disk must be matched to several other components in the system. First, it must be of a form factor compatible with the system case. Second, it must use the same interface as the controller or controllers within the PC.

Key Compatibility Selection Criteria: There are several important criteria to keep in mind when selecting a hard disk to suit your system, but most systems use standard hardware, making it actually fairly easy to find hardware that will suit your needs:
- Form Factor: Hard disks come in several different common sizes, matched to the bays in the system case where they are installed.
- Interface Type: Most hard drives use the IDE/ATA interface; others, especially in high-end systems, use the SCSI interface.
- Spindle Speed Support and Cooling: Some high-speed drives generate a significant amount of heat and may require special cooling. Some system cases, especially smaller ones, may not be able to use these faster drives without problems. Fortunately most newer drives have largely addressed these heat issues.
- Performance and Capacity Selection Criteria: There are many different performance issues related to hard disks. I discuss them in gory detail here, but for selecting a new hard drive I can boil the capacity and performance issues down to the following key points:
- Capacity: Obviously, the size of the drive is an important consideration: bigger drives hold more. At the same time, don't overspend on an enormous drive unless you do a lot of downloading or working with large graphics, audio and video files.
- Spindle Speed: One of the most important differentiators between different drive models from a performance standpoint is the speed at which the spindle spins (and thus the data platters as well).
- Seek Time: This specification, given in milliseconds, refers to how quickly the hard disk's actuator (the device that moves the head assembly) can position the heads to a random place on the surface of the disk platters.

\section*{Quality Selection Criteria:}

The hard disk is the only component in the PC where a failure means you have a much bigger problem on your hands than merely getting replacement hardware-
- Service Life: The manufacturer's designed life expectancy of the drive. For the stated number of years, the manufacturer of the drive believes the unit will work reliably and safely; beyond that point the drive may continue to work but the chance of problems increases significantly.
- Warranty Length: The number of years the manufacturer warrants the drive. Watch for discrepancies between this figure and the service life of the drive--whichever is lower is what the prudent person will trust!
- Warranty Policies: Some companies provide much better warranty service and coverage than others, and I consider this a quality indicator. See the "Warranty Issues" section below for more.
- Noise and Vibration: As spindle speeds and actuators get faster, drives make more and more noise unless careful engineering is done to counteract it.
- Quality and Reliability Features: Most drives come with a number of features that are designed to improve the integrity and reliability of drives.
- Capacity: Obviously this is important, as described above, though it is often presented with no performance specifications, as if capacity was all that mattered.

\section*{Computer Hardware Troubleshooting Techniques}

Power
1. If your computer is experiencing power issues, there are a few things to check whether it is a serious issue or not. First, if the computer does not turn on at all, make sure all the cords are connected properly.

\section*{Video}
2. If you are getting power, but no video, you can check a few different hardware components for functionality. Check the video first by plugging in an external monitor. If the monitor displays video there may be an issue with the monitor you are currently using on your computer. If there is no video, try switching out the RAM on your computer, as sometimes bad RAM causes video anomalies. If this does not work, it is likely you have a faulty graphics card.

\section*{Hard Drive}
3. The hard drive is the scariest of all prospective failures, as it contains all of your information. If your computer will not load the operating system, try booting from the operating system CD that came with your computer.

\section*{Trial-and-error}

Personal computers are highly modular by design. The most powerful trouble-shooting technique is to isolate the problem to a specific component by trial-and-error.

\section*{Basic Troubleshooting Tips after Installing a New Hard Drive}

Warning: Always turn off the computer before changing jumpers or unplugging cables and cards. Wear a ground strap or use other antistatic precautions while working on your computer or handling your drive.
- Verify compatibility. Verify that the host adapter and drive are appropriately matched to each other and to your computer. Refer to the relevant documentation for details.
- Check all cards. Verify that all cards are seated in their slots on the motherboard and secured with mounting screws.
- Check all connectors and cables. Make sure all ribbon and power cables are securely connected. Ribbon cables are easily damaged, especially at the connector. Try a new cable that
you know is good. Make sure no connector pins are bent. Verify that pin 1 on the interface cable is aligned with pin 1 on the drive and host adapter (see Figure 2 on page 6).
- Verify jumper settings. Review the instructions in this guide and in your host adapter installation guide. Make sure all appropriate jumpers are installed or removed as necessary.
- Check your power-supply specifications. Each time you add a new device to your computer, make sure your cornputer's internal power supply can support the total power demand. If necessary, consult your dealer for a new power supply.
- Verify the drive-type settings in the system setup program. The drive-type settings in the system BIOS must not exceed the physical specifications of your drive. Also, the settings must not exceed the limitations set by the operating system and BIOS.
- Check for viruses. Before you use someone else's diskette in your system for the first time, scan the diskette for viruses.

\section*{COMPUTER SUPPORT}
computer support companies and services specialize in troubleshooting and fixing a wide variety of primarily software-related personal computer issues and network connectivity problems as well as some hardware issues.

Also known as technical support, computer support can take the form of an on-site visit or remote help via telephone, e-mail, text or instant messaging, online chat or even remote desktop control.

\section*{METHODS}

\section*{Online support}
email - electronic mail- Short for electronic mail, email (or e-mail) is defined as the transmission of messages over communications networks. Typically the messages are notes entered from the keyboard or electronic files stored on disk. Most mainframes, minicomputers, and computer networks have an email system.
Some electronic mail systems are confined to a single computer system or network, but others have gateways to other computer systems, enabling users to send electronic mail anywhere in the
world. Companies that are fully computerized make extensive use of e-mail because it is fast, flexible, and reliable.
- Instant messaging- a type of communications service that enables you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet, analagous to a telephone conversation but using text-based, not voice-based, communication. Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you whenever somebody on your private list is online. You can then initiate a chat session with that particular individual.
- Chat-Real-time communication between two users via computer. Once a chat has been initiated, either user can enter text by typing on the keyboard and the entered text will appear on the other user's monitor. Most networks and online services offer a chat feature
- Remote Desktop-Remote Desktop, a function included with Windows XP Professional, enables you to connect to your computer across the Internet from virtually any computer, Pocket PC, or smartphone. Unlike a typical VPN connection (which will give a remote PC access to the company network) Remote Desktop will actually allow you to see and control your connected PC as though you were sitting directly in front of it
- help desk MANAGEMENT is a resource intended to provide the customer or end user with information and support related to a company's or institution's products and services. The purpose of a help desk is usually to troubleshoot problems or provide guidance about products such as computers, electronic equipment, food, apparel, or software
- Planning and providing staff training
