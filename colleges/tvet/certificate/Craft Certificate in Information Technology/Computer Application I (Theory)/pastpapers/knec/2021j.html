                                   <li><strong>Mechanical Mouse:</strong> Uses a rubber or metal ball on its underside.

Requires a clean, flat surface and periodic cleaning of the ball/rollers.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Optical Mouse:</strong> Uses a light source (usually an LED or laser) and a small sensor (like a tiny camera) to detect movement relative to the surface underneath. It takes rapid snapshots of the surface to track motion. Does not have moving parts like the ball, works on more surfaces, and generally requires less maintenance.</li>

                               <p><strong>(a) Memory Management:</strong> Controls and coordinates the computer's main memory (RAM). It allocates memory space to processes that need it, keeps track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by which process, decides which processes (or parts of processes) to move into and out of memory, and deallocates memory when processes terminate.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Process Management:</strong> Manages the execution of processes (running programs). This includes creating and deleting processes, scheduling processes for CPU time, providing mechanisms for process synchronization and communication, and handling process suspension and resumption.</p>

                                   <li><strong>Report Wizard:</strong> A guided tool that steps the user through the process of creating a report by asking questions about the desired data source, fields, grouping, sorting, layout, and style, automatically generating a basic report based on the answers.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Report Design (View):</strong> A view that allows detailed manual control over the report's layout and appearance.

                               <p>Mary would use the <strong>Sizing Handles</strong>. When the picture is selected, small squares or circles (handles) appear on its border and corners. Clicking and dragging these handles allows her to change the picture's dimensions (height and width). Dragging a corner handle typically resizes proportionally, while dragging a side handle stretches or compresses in one direction.</p>

                               <p><strong>(a) Speaker Notes:</strong> Allows the presenter to add private notes, reminders, or additional details associated with each slide. These notes are visible to the presenter (e.g., in Presenter View or on printed notes pages) but not to the audience during the main slideshow, aiding delivery.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Timings:</strong> Allows setting specific durations for how long each slide or animation should be displayed before automatically advancing. This is used for creating self-running presentations or for rehearsing and ensuring the presentation fits within a specific time limit.</p>

                               <p><strong>(a) #NULL! :</strong> This error usually occurs when you specify an intersection of two cell ranges that do not actually intersect, or when you use an incorrect range operator (e.g., using a space instead of a comma or colon where required by a function).</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) #N/A :</strong> This error means "Not Available". It typically occurs in lookup functions (like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, MATCH) when the value being looked up cannot be found in the specified lookup range. It can also be intentionally returned by the NA() function.</p>
