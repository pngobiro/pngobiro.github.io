                               <p><strong>(a) Textbox Feature Function:</strong></p>
                               <p>A textbox allows users to insert text anywhere on a page, independent of the main document flow. It's useful for creating callouts, sidebars, captions, or placing text precisely over or next to graphics, offering more layout flexibility than standard paragraph text.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Data Validation:</strong></p>
                               <p>Data validation is a feature used to control the type of data or the values that users can enter into a cell. It helps ensure data accuracy and consistency by setting rules (e.g., restricting input to whole numbers, dates within a range, values from a dropdown list) and providing error messages if invalid data is entered.</p>

                               <p><strong>(a) Reason for Using Table Template:</strong></p>
                               <p>A database administrator might use a table template to quickly create a new table with predefined fields, data types, and properties relevant to a common subject (e.g., contacts, events, tasks). This saves time, ensures consistency across similar tables, and incorporates best practices embedded in the template design.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Feature to Restrict Worksheet Access:</strong></p>
                               <p>Linnet could use the <strong>Protect Sheet</strong> feature. This allows her to lock specific cells or ranges (preventing editing) while potentially allowing users to interact with other parts of the worksheet. She can set a password to prevent others from unprotecting the sheet and changing the restrictions.</p>

                               <ul>
                                   <li><strong>Primary File (Main Document/Template):</strong> This is the document containing the standard text, formatting, and layout that will be the same for all merged copies (e.g., the letter template). It also contains merge fields (placeholders) where data from the secondary file will be inserted.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Secondary File (Data Source):</strong> This file contains the variable data that will be inserted into the merge fields of the primary document (e.g., a spreadsheet, database table, or list containing names, addresses, and other personalized information for each recipient).</li>
                               </ul>
                               <p><strong>(b) Circumstance for Many-to-Many Relationship:</strong></p>
                               <p>A many-to-many relationship is needed when one record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B, AND one record in Table B can also be related to multiple records in Table A. A common example is the relationship between Students and Courses: one student can enroll in many courses, and one course can have many students enrolled. This relationship is typically implemented using a third "junction" or "linking" table that contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of both Table A and Table B.</p>
