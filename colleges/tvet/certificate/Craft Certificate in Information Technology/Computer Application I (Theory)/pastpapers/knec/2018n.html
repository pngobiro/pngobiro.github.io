                                   <li><strong>Ease of Use/Intuitiveness:</strong> GUIs use visual elements (icons, menus, windows) that are generally easier for users, especially beginners, to understand and interact with compared to memorizing commands.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Features and options are often visible in menus or toolbars, making it easier for users to discover and learn the software's capabilities without needing extensive documentation.</li>

                               <p>Moses would use the <strong>Cut and Paste</strong> feature. He would select the first paragraph, use the 'Cut' command (Ctrl+X or via menu/toolbar), move the cursor to the end of the document, and then use the 'Paste' command (Ctrl+V or via menu/toolbar).</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Purpose of Section Break:</strong></p>
                               <p>A section break divides a document into sections, allowing different formatting (such as page orientation, margins, columns, headers/footers, page numbering) to be applied to each section independently. This provides more layout control than simple page breaks.</p>

                            <p>(a) State one benefit of using document templates in a word program.</p>
                            <p>(b) Ann created the following document using a word processing program. Use it to answer the question that follows.</p>
                            <h4>History of Word processors</h4>
                            <p>Users of word processing software today would be forgiven to think that things have always been the way they are.</p>
                            <p>But they would be surprised to know that the use of word processing software only dates back to the eighties and that was in the developed world.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps what would surprise them more to hear is that before the eighties, when one talked about a word processor, they generally meant a hardware piece.</p>
                            <p>These were pieces of equipment sold solely for the purpose of word processing. They contained one program and a keyboard.</p>
                            <p>The eighties saw the emergence of word processors run on computers not dedicated to word processing</p>
                            <p>The earlier ones included:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Apple writer</li>

                               <p><strong>(a) Benefit of Using Document Templates:</strong></p>
                               <p>Using document templates ensures consistency in formatting and layout across multiple documents of the same type (e.g., letters, reports, memos), saving time and maintaining a professional appearance.</p>

                                   <li><strong>Heading Formatting:</strong> "History of Word processors" is likely formatted as a heading (e.g., larger font size, bold).</li>
                                   <li><strong>Paragraph Spacing/Indentation:</strong> There appears to be spacing between paragraphs, and potentially first-line indentation (though not explicitly clear).</li>
                                   <li><strong>Numbered List:</strong> The list "1. Apple writer..." uses automatic numbering.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Font Style/Size:</strong> A specific font style and size is used throughout the document body.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Bold Text:</strong> The heading is likely bold.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Text appears to be left-aligned (standard).</li>
                                   <li><strong>Line Spacing:</strong> A specific line spacing (e.g., single, 1.5 lines) is applied.</li>

                               <p><strong>(a) Benefit of Using Macro for Formatting:</strong></p>
                               <p>Using a macro saves significant time and reduces the chance of errors when applying the same complex or multi-step formatting sequence repeatedly across many worksheets. It ensures consistency with a single click or shortcut key execution.</p>

                                   <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Arranges the rows (records) in a data range based on the values in one or more columns, either in ascending (A-Z, smallest to largest) or descending (Z-A, largest to smallest) order. All rows are still visible, just reordered.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Hides rows that do not meet specified criteria, displaying only the subset of data that matches the conditions. It does not change the order of the displayed rows but reduces the number of visible rows.</li>

                               <p><strong>(a) Freeze Panes Function:</strong></p>
                               <p>The freeze panes feature keeps specific rows (usually top header rows) and/or columns (usually leftmost identifier columns) visible on the screen while scrolling through the rest of the worksheet. This helps keep headings or key identifiers in view when working with large datasets.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Feature to Hide Formula Column:</strong></p>
                               <p>Joan could use the <strong>Hide Column</strong> feature. She would right-click on the column letter containing the formulas and select 'Hide' from the context menu. The column will disappear from view but its data remains and can still be used in calculations. It can be unhidden later if needed.</p>

                               <p><strong>(a) Benefit of Using Forms in Database:</strong></p>
                               <p>Forms provide a user-friendly interface for entering, viewing, and editing data in tables, often presenting one record at a time. This makes data interaction easier and less error-prone compared to working directly in the table's datasheet view, especially for non-technical users.</p>

                               <p>Criteria are conditions or rules specified in a query to filter records. Only records that meet the defined criteria will be included in the query results. Criteria can be simple (e.g., `City = "Nairobi"`) or complex involving multiple fields, comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `=`), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and wildcards.</p>

                               <p>Packaging a presentation (using a feature like "Package for CD" or similar) ensures that all linked files (like videos, audio clips, non-standard fonts) are included along with the presentation file itself.

                                   <li><strong>Organizing into Sections:</strong> Some versions allow creating logical sections within the presentation in this view.</li>
