                               <p>The exact syntax depends on the specific database reporting tool, but it generally looks like one of these:</p>
                               <ul>
                                   <li><code>=Sum([marks])</code></li>

                               <p>(Where `[marks]` represents the field name containing the values to be summed).</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Relationship Between Tables:</strong></p>
                               <p>A **One-to-Many** relationship could be created between the `DEPARTMENT` table and the `EMPLOYEE` table. The `Dept_ID` field in the `EMPLOYEE` table acts as a foreign key, linking each employee record to one specific department record in the `DEPARTMENT` table (using `Dept_ID` as the primary key there). One department can have multiple employees, but each employee belongs to only one department according to this structure.</p>
