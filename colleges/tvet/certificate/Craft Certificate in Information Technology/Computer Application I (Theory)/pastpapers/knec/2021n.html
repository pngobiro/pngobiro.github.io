                               <p><strong>(a) Memory Management:</strong> The OS manages the computer's primary memory (RAM) by allocating blocks of memory to running processes, keeping track of used and free memory portions, deciding which processes get memory when, and deallocating memory when processes terminate to prevent conflicts and ensure efficient memory utilization.</p>
                               <p><strong>(b) Input/Output Operations:</strong> The OS manages communication between the computer and its peripheral devices (like keyboard, mouse, printer, disk drives). It handles device requests from processes, loads appropriate device drivers, sends commands to devices, receives interrupts, and manages data transfer to/from devices, abstracting the hardware complexity from applications.</p>

                                   <li><strong>Network Model:</strong> Data is organized as a graph where records (nodes) can have multiple parent and child nodes, allowing for more complex many-to-many relationships than the hierarchical model.</li>

                               <p><strong>(b) Purpose of Foreign Key:</strong></p>
                               <p>A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table (or the same table).

                               <p>Advantages of using Master Slides:</p>
                               <ul>
                                   <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures a uniform look and feel across all slides (or slides using a specific layout) by applying consistent formatting elements like fonts, colors, backgrounds, logos, and placeholder positions defined in the master.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Allows making global changes easily. Modifying an element on the slide master automatically updates all slides based on that master, saving significant time compared to editing each slide individually.</li>

                               <p>Reasons for using Firewalls:</p>
                               <ul>
                                   <li><strong>Blocking Unauthorized Access:</strong> Firewalls act as a barrier between Marion's computer (or internal network) and the external network (Internet), inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic and blocking connections that don't meet predefined security rules, thus preventing unauthorized access attempts or intrusions.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Filtering Malicious Traffic:</strong> Firewalls can be configured to identify and block known malicious traffic patterns, prevent access to harmful websites, or stop certain types of malware or network attacks from reaching her computer.</li>
