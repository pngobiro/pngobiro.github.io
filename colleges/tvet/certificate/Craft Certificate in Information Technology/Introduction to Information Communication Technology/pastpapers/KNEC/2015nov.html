                                <p>Two justifications for preferring an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitor over a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Size, Weight, and Space Savings:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>LCD monitors are significantly thinner and lighter than bulky CRT monitors.</li>
                                            <li>They occupy much less desk space, making them ideal for smaller workspaces or multi-monitor setups.</li>
                                            <li>Easier to move, mount, and adjust.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>LCDs typically offer sharper text and images with no screen flicker, which reduces eye strain during prolonged use compared to the flickering inherent in CRT refresh rates.</li>
                                            <li>They produce less glare and generally have better brightness and contrast ratios under typical office lighting conditions.</li>
                                            <li>Consume significantly less power and generate less heat compared to CRTs.</li>

                                        <li>It is specific to a particular computer architecture (CPU family).</li>
                                        <li>Requires an assembler program to translate the mnemonics into executable machine code.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Direct File Organization Method:</strong></p>
                                    <p>Direct file organization (also known as random access or hashed file organization) allows records to be accessed directly without reading through preceding records. Key characteristics include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Address Calculation:</strong> A record's physical storage address (e.g., block number) is determined directly from its key field using a mathematical formula or hashing algorithm.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fast Access:</strong> Enables very fast retrieval and updating of specific records because the system can calculate the address and go directly to that location.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Non-Sequential Storage:</strong> Records are not necessarily stored in sequential order based on their keys; their location depends on the hashing algorithm's output.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Collision Handling:</strong> Requires mechanisms to handle situations where different keys hash to the same address (collisions), such as using overflow areas or chaining.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Suitable for applications requiring rapid access to individual records, like online transaction processing (OLTP) systems or real-time databases.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Makes data unreadable to unauthorized parties who do not possess the correct decryption key.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Process:</strong> An encryption algorithm mathematically transforms the data, and only someone with the corresponding decryption key can reverse the process to recover the original plaintext.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Types:</strong> Can be symmetric (same key for encryption and decryption) or asymmetric (different public/private keys).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Used to secure data at rest (stored on disks) and data in transit (transmitted over networks) to prevent eavesdropping or unauthorized access.</li>

                                <p>Two methods to improve ergonomics for a computer operator in an office:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Adjusting Workstation Setup:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Chair Adjustment:</strong> Ensure the chair height allows feet to be flat on the floor, knees at roughly 90 degrees, and provides adequate lumbar (lower back) support. Armrests should support forearms parallel to the floor.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Monitor Positioning:</strong> Place the monitor directly in front, about an arm's length away. The top of the screen should be at or slightly below eye level to maintain a neutral neck posture. Reduce glare by adjusting screen angle or using anti-glare filters.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Keyboard and Mouse Placement:</strong> Position the keyboard and mouse close together and directly in front, allowing elbows to be bent at approximately 90 degrees and wrists to remain straight while typing or using the mouse. Use wrist rests if needed.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Implementing Proper Work Habits:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Taking Regular Breaks:</strong> Encourage frequent short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes every hour) to stand up, stretch, and walk around. This reduces muscle fatigue and eye strain. Use the 20-20-20 rule for eyes (look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Varying Tasks:</strong> Alternate between computer tasks and non-computer tasks (if possible) throughout the day to avoid prolonged static postures and repetitive movements.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Maintaining Good Posture:</strong> Be mindful of sitting upright, keeping shoulders relaxed, and avoiding slouching or leaning forward excessively.</li>

                                    <p><strong>(a) Computer Output to Microfilm (COM):</strong></p>
                                    <p>COM is a process for copying data from electronic media on computers directly onto microfilm (microfiche or roll microfilm). It involves:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> Transferring digital data (usually reports or large archives) from computer storage (like magnetic tape or disk) to a COM recorder.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Image Creation:</strong> The COM recorder projects the data onto a small screen (often a CRT) and photographs it onto microfilm.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Microfilm Output:</strong> The result is a compact, human-readable archive on microfilm, which requires a microfilm reader to view.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Primarily used for long-term archival storage of large volumes of data before digital storage became cheap and prevalent. It offered space savings and longevity compared to paper archives.</li>
