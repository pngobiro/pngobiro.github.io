                                    <p><strong>(a) Firmware Definition:</strong></p>
                                    <p>Firmware is a specific type of software that is permanently embedded into a hardware device's read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory. It provides low-level control and instructions necessary for the hardware to operate and communicate with other software (like the operating system).</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Examples: BIOS/UEFI on a motherboard, software on a router or printer.</li>
                                        <li>It's typically updated less frequently than application or system software.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Exclusive Rights:</strong> A patent grants the inventor the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and import the invention for a set period (usually 20 years), preventing others from commercially exploiting it without permission.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Market Advantage & Commercialization:</strong> Patents provide a competitive edge, can attract investment, and allow the inventor to license the technology to others for royalties or sell the patent rights outright.</li>

                                                <li><strong>Bandwidth/Speed Requirements:</strong> The amount of data that needs to be transmitted per unit of time. Higher bandwidth needs (e.g., video streaming) require faster media like fiber optics.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The physical distance the signal needs to travel. Different media have different maximum effective distances (e.g., twisted pair ~100m, fiber optics can span kilometers).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The budget available for installation and maintenance. Fiber optic is generally more expensive than twisted pair.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Environment/Interference:</strong> The level of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the environment. Fiber optic is immune to EMI, unlike copper cables.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Security Requirements:</strong> The need to protect data from eavesdropping. Fiber optic is generally more secure than copper cables.</li>

                                                <li><strong>Baseband:</strong> Transmits a single digital signal at a time over the cable. Uses the entire bandwidth for one channel. Simpler, often used in older LANs (like early Ethernet).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Broadband:</strong> Transmits multiple analog signals simultaneously over the cable using different frequency channels (Frequency Division Multiplexing). Allows for carrying multiple data streams (e.g., data, voice, video) concurrently. Used in cable television (CATV) systems.</li>
