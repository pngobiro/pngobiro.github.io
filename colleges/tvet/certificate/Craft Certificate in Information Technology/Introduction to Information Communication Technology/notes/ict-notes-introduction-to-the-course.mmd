\subsection*{1.0 INTRODUCTION TO ICT}

\section*{Definition of Terms}
a) Computer

An electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory, which can accept and manipulate data to produce information.
"one that computes; specifically : a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data into information"
b) Data

Is raw facts, numbers, letters or symbols that need to be processed. It is the collection of unprocessed items.
c) Information

Processed data that is meaningful and useful.
d) Information technology (IT)

The use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise
e) $I C T-$

Stands for "Information and Communication Technologies." ICT refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. It is similar to Information Technology (IT), but focuses primarily on communication technologies. This includes the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication mediums.
Basically ICT is IT with some additional features of Connectivity.
NB: All computers have several parts in common:
- Input devices, which allow data and commands to be entered into the computer
- a means of storing commands and data
- a central processing unit which controls the processing
- a means of returning the processed information in the form of output

In general, a computer is an electronic device, which accepts information, processes it and returns new information as output.

\section*{Functions of Computers}

The functions of computers can be better looked at by naming the appropriate situations where to use a computer and areas where computers are applied (Computer Application Areas).
Situations where it is appropriate to use a computer are;
a) When you need to work at high speed
- The processing speed of computers is in the range of millions to billions of instructions per second. In other words, the time required to execute an instruction can be measured in nanosecond or picoseconds

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- For example it may take you about three minutes to find the location of a book in the library by searching the index cards. However, if you use a computerized library system to search books location, it may only take you a few seconds, depending on how fast you can type. Normally, the computer only takes less than a second to process your request.
b) When you have to perform a repeated activity
- Computers built with integrated circuits are more reliable. They have low failure rate.
- Computers are more suitable to handle repetitive tasks because they do not take tea breaks and sick leaves and never complain
- For example the automatic teller machines (ATM) are in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
c) When you have to perform complex calculations with Precision/Accuracy
- Computers can generate accurate results, provided that the input data is correct and the program of instructions is reliable.
- They are not affected by emotion but they only do what they are programmed to do. Hence they can produce consistent result.
- If inaccurate data is entered, the computers will generate incorrect results. This is known as "Garbage In; Garbage Out" (GIGO).
- Most of the "computer errors" can be traced to human errors such as incorrect input data and unreliable programs.
- For example, the item prices determined by scanning the bar-codes at the point-of sale terminals in supermarkets are far more accurate than those typed in by cashiers.
d) Where you have to store large volumes of data
- Imagine, if you can, how many filing-cabinet drawers would be required to hold the thousands of student records kept by your school. It would take a lot of space to store data and information in paper form. However, computers can store them on several disks several disks that take up less space than a first-aid box.

\section*{History of Computers}

\section*{Computer generations}

Modern age of computers spans about 50 years. This is typically broken down into five generations. Each generation is marked by a significant advancement in technology.
a) The first generation computers (1944-1956)

Technology used to process data into information: Vacuum tube
Machines languages were used to instruct the computer.
Magnetic drums was used as primary memory.
Punch card, paper tape was for secondary storage. Punched card, printing devices were used for input/output operations and store the result.
It occupies very large space, slow processing, inefficient and unreliable due to low accuracy.
Power consumption was very high and it generated much heat.
It could only perform straight forward simple numerical calculation.
Computer used to be much expensive.
Example of Computers were ENIAC and UNIVAC
b) Second generation computers (1957-1963)

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

The computers relied on transistors (signal Bridges) and other solid state devices that replaced vacuum tubes in the computer circuitry. Transistors were more reliable and more stable than vacuum tubes; they generated less heat and consumed less power. Magnetic cores were used in the main memory.
Second generation computer replaced machine language with assembly language, allowing abbreviated programming codes to replace long, difficult binary codes.
Assembly language and machines independent language such as COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) and FORTRAN (Formula Translation) were introduced
Magnetic drum and magnetic tape were used as secondary memory.
c) Third generation computers (1964-1979)

The third generation computers used integrated circuits(IC's) which were made by combining several transistors together. IC is a complete electronic circuit that packages transistors and other electronic components on a small silicon chip.
Introduction of Operating System which allowed multitasking
High-level languages like BASIC are used to develop programs.
Semiconductor memory like RAM and ROM were used as primary memory.
Monitor and keyboard were introduced for data input and output respectively.
d) Fourth generation computers (1979-1989)

Technology in use: VLSI is introduced and used Microprocessor-based technology. Problem-oriented fourth generation language (4GL) is used to develop programs.
Magnetic disks like hard disk, optical disk (CD, DVD), Blue-ray disk, flashes memory are used as secondary memory.
e) Fifth generation computers (1990-present)

VLSI became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) Technology.
The generation is based on Parallel processing hardware and artificial intelligence software. AI includes Robotics, Neural Networks, Expert systems, natural language understanding and generation.
E-mail, Internet and mobile communication are developed.

\section*{Classification of computers}

Computers can be classified based on size and power, functionality and purpose;

\section*{Classification according to size/power}

Computers range in size and capability. At one end of the scale are supercomputers, very large computers with thousands of linked microprocessors that perform extremely complex calculations. At the other end are tiny computers embedded in cars, TVs, stereo systems, calculators, and appliances. These computers are built to perform a limited number of tasks.

Computers are classified according to their physical size, memory size, processing speeds and price as follows;

\section*{a) Microcomputers/Personal computers}

It can be defined as a small single-user computer based on a microprocessor.
They range from portable computers to desktop computers up to microcontrollers.
They are applied in small businesses and for personal use.
The portables include laptops, notebooks and palm tops. The portables have chargeable batteries.

\section*{b) Minicomputer}

A multi-user computer capable of supporting of hundreds of users simultaneously. They have more than one processor, more processing speeds and more storage capacities compared to microcomputers. They are applied in medium sized organizations like stock control in supermarkets.
c) Mainframe computers

Powerful multi-user computers capable of supporting many hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously.
It works under controlled environment with its users being distributed away from the computer room.
They are used in many banks, local airlines, e.t.c.

\section*{d) Supercomputers}

The most powerful computers in the world. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amounts of mathematical calculations (number crunching). For example, worldwide weather forecasting requires a supercomputer. Other uses of supercomputers scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data.

\section*{Personal Computer Types}

The personal computer, or PC, is designed to be used by one person at a time. Actual personal computers can be generally classified by size and chassis / case. The chassis or case is the metal frame that serves as the structural support for electronic components. Every computer system requires at least one chassis to house the circuit boards and wiring. There are two basic flavors of chassis designs-desktop models and tower models-but there are many variations on these two basic types. Then come the portable computers that are computers small enough to carry. Portable computers include notebook and tablets, hand-held computers, palmtops, and PDAs.

\section*{Classification according to functionality}

Classification is based on the signal that is used in processing of data.

\section*{a) Analogue computers}

They process analogue data. Data that is continuous in nature and of varying quantities e.g. changes in time, electrical voltage, pressure and temperature changes. The application of

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
analogue computers is confined to specialized areas as in scientific or engineering experiments, manufacturing processes and military weapons.

\section*{b) Digital computers}

Computers which process digital data. Digital data is based on states; "ON" and "OFF" or 1's and 0 's. These types of computers are used in a wider cross section of the application areas as scientific, industrial and most of the other computer based data processing applications.

\section*{Classification according to purpose}
a) General purpose computers

Computers designed to carry out a wide variety of tasks. They are adapted to carry out this wide variety of tasks by means of specifically written instructions. They are the most common type of computers.
b) Special purpose computers

Computers designed to be task specific and most of the times their job is to solve one particular problem. E.g. a computer server which is a specially manufactured computer to serve other computers on a network.
c) Dedicated computers

Computers committed to one processing tasks, though capable of a variety of tasks. For example, a computer dedicated to a database may be called a "database server". "File servers" manage a large collection of computer files.
Assignment: Learner to explain a hybrid type of computer

\section*{Components of a Computer System}

A computer system consist of three major components; hardware software and liveware
The hardware component consists of the physical (tangible) components which are mechanical, electrical and electronic parts of the system. The components are used as devices for input storage, output, processing and communication

The software component is made up of detailed instructions, called programs and data that enable the hardware to perform its assigned tasks. A program is a series of step by step instructions that tell the computer what and how to do a task.

Liveware refers to the human system, opposed to hardware or software in a computer. They are the people who coordinate the various activities, which are necessary to get a computer system to perform useful tasks. e.g;
i) Database administrator who design, implement, maintain and repair an organization's database.
ii) Computer programmers write, test, and maintain the programs that computers follow when performing specific functions.
iii) System Analyst and Designers
iv) Network administrators provide operational support for and management of computer networks to ensure they run efficiently. The IT networks can range from internet and private networks to large communications networks
v) Computer operator
vi) Data entry clerks

\subsection*{2.0 COMPUTER HARDWARE}

Physical parts of a computer system: Computer hardware can physically be divided into two parts;
a) Peripheral Devices

A device that connects to and works with the computer to either put information into it or get information out of it. It helps end users access and use the functionalities of a computer.
b) System Unit:

The casing (Housing) that contains the main components of a computer. Some of the components of the system unit are;
i.) Power supply unit

Converts incoming alternating current to a steady low-voltage direct current to be used by the computer.
ii.) Disk drives

Places for reading and writing data from or on a secondary storage device. E.g. Hard disk Drive, CD Drives
iii.) Ports

A connecting socket on the outside of the system unit used to connect a peripheral device.
Parallel ports are used to connect external devices that need to send or receive a lot of data over a short distance.
Serial ports are used for a wide variety of purposes e.g. to connect mouse, keyboard, to the system unit.
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) Ports:
USB Port (universal Serial Bus Port).
VGA Port (Video Graphics Array Port) for connecting monitor.
HDMI Port (High Definition Multimedia Interface) A standard for connecting highdefinition video devices.
iv.) Motherboard/System Board

The circuit board on which the main electronic parts are mounted. It's made up of a substance called fibre glass that does not conduct electricity. The motherboard has the following built on it;
v.) Lithium Battery

Provides constant power for the system clock. It keeps the clock running

\section*{vi.) The CPU/Microprocessor}

The brain of the computer. It is a VLSI component that performs the systems calculations and processing. It is the most expensive chip in a Personal Computer (PC). Most PC compatibles use Intel family of microprocessors.
vii.) Specialized processor chips/Auxiliary Processors

A mother board usually has slots for plugging in specialized processor chips- two in particular you may encounter are math and graphics co-processor chips. A math processor helps programs using a lot of mathematical equations to run faster. A graphic processor chip enhances the performance of programs with lots of graphics and helps to create complex screen displays.
viii.) Memory chips

Made up of RAM and ROM chips. A chip is a small piece of silicon on which most integrated circuits are implemented.
ROM Chips have programs built into them at the factory. The content of ROM cannot be changed by the user. ROM chips contain special instructions for detailed computer operations e.g. ROM instructions may start the computer, give keyboard keys their special control capabilities and put characters on the screen. Variations of ROM chips are; PROMonce written cannot be changed and EPROM-can be erased with a special ultraviolet light and new instructions written on it.
RAM can be added on the computer using memory expansion boards on the mother board.
ix.) System clock

Controls the speed of operations within a computer. This speed is expressed in Hertz. The faster the clocks speed the faster the computer can process information. The system clock is needed to synchronize all components on the motherboard.
x.) Expansion slots and boards

Most Computers have open architectures thus are manufactured in a way to allow users to add new devices. This is made possible by use of expansion boards. Expansion boards plug into slots on the mother board called expansion slots. The expansion boards have ports that allow cables to be connected and thus connecting a peripheral device.

\section*{xi.) Bus line/bus}

Connects parts of the CPU to each other. It also links the CPU with other important hardware. A bus is a data roadway / pathway along which bits (electronic signals) travel. The greater the capacity of a bus, the more powerful and faster the operation or a computer. There are several types of bus e.g. data bus, address bus and control bus.
Assignment

\section*{INPUT DEVICES/HARDWARE}

Input devices convert people readable data into machine readable form. The input device codes human data into a form that can be understood by the computer. Categories of input devices are as follows;
i.) Keying devices

Keyboard

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

It allows entry of data inform of text by typing/pressing keys. Each key is simply a switch, which when pressed, results in a series of electronic signals representing the character sent to the computer.

\section*{ii.) Point and touch devices}

It is a form of direct entry input. Examples of devices are;
a) Mouse: a device that is moved on a flat surface to control the movement of a pointer on the screen. It has atleast two buttons used to give commands to the computer.
b) Joystick: a hand held device used for playing computer games.
c) Light Pen: a pen like device held in the hand and is sensitive to the presence and absence of light through a light sensitive cell at its end. The pen is used to select a point on the screen. They are used as design aids i.e. indicates what shape to draw, where they should be drawn on the screen and the size

iv.) Digital cameras: - Picks up pictures digitally and stores the pictures digitally on a flash memory chip.
v.) Scanning Devices

They enable direct data entry into a computer system from source documents. They convert text, graphics or special symbols to digital data that can be processed by the computer. Most of them use laser beams and reflected light to translate images of text, drawings, photos into digital form. Examples include;
a) Image scanners:- e.g. Hand held scanners and flat bed scanners
b) Fax Machines: Scans an image and sends it as electronic signals over telephone lines to another receiving fax machine which recreates the image on a paper.
c) Optical Mark Recognition:- reads the presence or absence of a Mark such as a pencil mark and converts them into computer understandable form. E.g. it reads answer sheets for KCPE exams
d) Optical Character Recognition:- reads pre-printed characters in a particular form and converts them into digital codes
e) Bar code readers:- reads sets of line of different thickness.

\section*{PROCESSING HARDWARE:}

Part of the computer that manipulates data into information; It is made up of the CPU and Main memory.

\section*{Central Processing Unit (CPU)}

The brain of the computer. It controls the transmission of data from input devices to memory; it processes the data held in main memory; it controls the transmission of information from main memory to output devices. The typical components of a CPU include the following:
- The control unit coordinates and controls all the operations carried out by the computer. The control unit operates by repeating three operations which are:
- Fetch - cause the next instruction to be fetched from memory;
- Decode - translate the program instruction into commands that the computer can process
- Execute - cause the instruction to be executed
- The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) plays two roles.
- Arithmetic operations - these operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- Logical operations - it compares two data items to determine whether the first one is smaller than, equal to or greater than the second item etc.
- Registers: high speed storage areas that temporary store data during processing. They are used by control unit and arithmetic logic unit. We have Data egisters, Instruction Registers, Program Counter, etc.

NB: The CPU communicates with the memory and input/output devices using buses. There are three types of buses:
a) Address bus: Many components are connected to one another through buses. Each component is assigned a unique ID. This ID is called the address of that component. If a component wants to communicate with another component, it uses address bus to specify the address of that component.
The address bus is a unidirectional bus. It can carry information only in one direction. It carries physical address of devices from microprocessor to the main memory.
b) Data Bus: Carries Data between processor and the memory. They are bi-directional buses (It means that: CPU can read data from memory using these lines also the CPU can write data to memory locations using these lines). The number of lines in data bus affects the speed of data transfer between different components. The data bus consists of $8,16,32$, or 64 lines. A 64 -line data bus can transfer 64 bits of data at one time.
c) Control Bus: used to transmit different commands or control signals from one component to another component. They are unidirectional buses that carry command signals from the microprocessor.

\section*{\{Student to draw a well labeled computer bus diagram\}}

The CPU's Processing Speed depends on a variety of factors including
i.) The size of circuitry paths, or buses that interconnect microprocessor components;

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
ii.) The capacity of registers,
iii.) The system clock speed,
iv.) The size of Cache Memory (an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed)
v.) The amount of RAM, among others.

The system clock controls how faster all the operations within a computer takes place. It uses fixed vibrations from a quartz crystal to deliver a steady stream of pulses to CPU. The faster the clock the more instructions the CPU can execute. The clock speed is measured in Hertz where 1 Hz equals 1 cycle (tick) per second. $1,000 \mathrm{~Hz}=1 \mathrm{KHz}, 1,000 \mathrm{KHz}=1 \mathrm{MHz}$, $1,000 \mathrm{MHz}=1 \mathrm{GHz}, 1,000 \mathrm{GHz}=1 \mathrm{THz}$, e.t.c. some of the intel processors are core $\mathrm{i} 3, \mathrm{i} 5, \mathrm{i} 7$ and i 9.

\section*{Main Memory}

The cycle (input - processing - output) would not be possible without a holding place for the instructions and data that the processor (CPU) can easily reach. This holding place is known as memory also called main storage and is internal to the computer consisting of RAM and possibly ROM.

It stores data that is currently being worked on. It is accessible by the CPU directly without going through any other input. This memory has fast access time by the CPU, its more expensive and usually of small quantities.
i.) Random Access Memory

RAM is the working memory of computer and thus holds data for processing, instructions for processing the data and processed data (information) waiting to be sent to output device or secondary storage. The more amount of RAM you have, the faster your computer operates and the better your software performs.
RAM is volatile; losing the stored information in an event of power loss, and quite expensive.
It is called random access because the processor or computer can access any location in memory in any order as contrasted with sequential access devices which must be accessed in order.
There are 2 basic types; Static RAM and Dynamic RAM
ii.) Read Only Memory

Is also random access but only for reads, once data has been written onto a ROM chip, it cannot be removed and can only be read.
It refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics. Most personal computers have a small amount of ROM (a few thousand bytes).
Retains its contents even when the computer is turned off and is therefore referred to as being nonvolatile.

\section*{OUTPUT DEVICES / HARDWARE}

Devices that translate information processed by the computer into a form that humans can understand. The two principal kinds of output are softcopy and hardcopy:

\section*{i.) Softcopy}

Refers to output that is shown on a display or is in audio or voice form. The output cannot be touched.
a) Display screens

Images are represented on the screen by individual dots called pixels. A pixel for picture element is the smallest unit on the screen that can be turned on and off or made different shades or be assigned a color.
They can be classified based on technology in use as;
- CRT Screen: Cathode ray tube (CRT) is used to display images on the screen or video display terminal. CRT monitors are relatively inexpensive, cumbersome and heavy.
- Flat Panel Displays: made up of two plates of glass with a substance in between them, which is activated in different ways. They are distinguished as;
- Liquid-Crystal Display: Liquid-crystal display monitors use a layer of pixels to display an image. Instead of an electron beam, LCD displays use transparent electrodes to control the array of pixels and update the picture. This allows LCD monitors to be much thinner than their CRT counterparts. An LCD display also requires less power than a CRT.
- Light-Emitting Diode Display:- A light-emitting diode monitor is essentially an upgraded version of an LCD display. Both LCD and LED monitors use transparent electrodes to control different pixels. In an LED display, however, light emitting diodes are placed behind the screen and act as a backlight. This increases the definition and brightness of the monitor. LED monitors use less power than both LCD and CRT monitors. This makes them ideal for energy sensitive devices, such as laptops and tablets.
- Plasma Display Panel: Plasma display panel monitors use small cells of charged gases to create an image. These cells are similar to household fluorescent light bulbs. Each plasma cell creates its own illumination, which eliminates the need for a separate back light and gives PDP monitors strong contrast. A plasma monitor is typically heavier than an LCD display. Plasma screens also draw more power than both LCD and LED monitors, and are susceptible to "burned in" images if they are left on for long periods of time.
- TFT (Thin Film Transistor): Is a flat panel display that creates images in which each pixel is controlled by transistors. Displays high quality output of a of a flat panel screen.
- Organic Light Emitting Diode(OLED),

Whether CRT or Flat Panel Display, Screens clarity depends on:
- Aspect Ratio. Is the ratio of the width to the height of the display area. Two common aspect ratio: 4:3, 16:9
- Display Resolution. The resolution of a monitor indicates how densely packed the pixels are. The number of pixels arranged horizontally by the number of pixels arranged vertically is the resolution. In general, the more pixels (often expressed in dots per inch), the sharper the image. Most modern monitors can display 1024 by 768 pixels, the SVGA standard. Some high-end models can display 1280 by 1024 , or even 1600 by 1200 .
- Refresh Rate. The refresh rate is the number of times in a second that a monitor draws the data. The refresh rate for a monitor is measured in hertz $(\mathrm{Hz})$. A flickering monitor can contribute to eyestrain and headaches. The faster the refresh rate, the less the monitor flickers.
- Color Depth. Color depth describes how many colors that can be displayed on a monitor's screen. Common color depths used by monitor.
b) Sound output: Most computers usually come with sound speakers, for good sound, you need to connect external amplified speakers.
c) Projectors: Similar to monitors but projects an image on to a screen. They are mainly used for presentations
ii.) Hardcopy:

Refers to computer output that is in physical tangible form.
a) Printer: an output device that prints characters, symbols and graphics on a paper or another hardcopy medium. Printers may be character printers/ line printer / page printers or impact / non impacts, low speed printers / high speed, e.t.c.
E.g.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\section*{STORAGE HARDWARE}

\section*{Computer storage fundamentals}

All electronic devices are known to communicate in two ways i.e. binary mode of communication. An example is a bulb which can either be "ON" or "OFF". Computers given the fact that they are made of electronic components, they therefore have a binary language. The binary digits 1 and 0 constitute computer language which either represents "ON" or "OFF". A group of 8 bits is used to code one human character in the computer. This is called a byte. i.e. 1 or 0 is called a bit, 8 bits $=$ a byte $=1$ human character, 1024 bytes $=1$ Kilobyte, $1024 \mathrm{~KB}=1$ Mega Byte, $1024 \mathrm{MB}=1$ Giga byte, $1024 \mathrm{~GB}=1$ Terabyte, 1024TB $=1$ Petabyte, etc.

The byte is a standard unit for measuring information amount stored in a computer.

\section*{Computer Data Access Methods}
- Sequential Access: Also called serial access. Data is stored in sequence, e.g. alphabetically. It is less expensive because it uses magnetic tapes which are cheaper. The disadvantage is that searching for data is slow. It's only exhibited in secondary storage i.e. in magnetic tapes.
- Direct Access Method: Also called random access. In this method the computer goes directly to the information one wants. This method is faster for finding specific data. E.g of devices are Optical disks, hard disks, flash disks, e.t.c.

\section*{Types of storage}

Computer storage is divided into two:
$\checkmark$ Primary storage/ Main Memory/ Internal Storage. E.g. RAM, ROM
$\checkmark$ Secondary Storage/ Back-up Storage/ External Storage E.g. floppy disks, Hard disks, Magnetic Tapes, Compact Disks, Flash Disks, Memory stick, e.t.c.

\section*{Secondary storage}

Stores data and programs permanently for future use, it allows for mass storage of data and programs and it's usually cheap compared to primary memory.
Some of the criteria that is used in choosing secondary storage includes;
- Storage capacity: high storage capacity devices are desirable for many sophisticated programs and large databases
- Size: some situation require compact storage devices others don't for portability.
- Cost: how much does the device cost
- Portability:
- Access Speed: e.g. it is faster to access solid state storage devices compared to optical disks.

\section*{Types of secondary storage devices}
a) Magnetic tape

It's a flat plastic ribbon on which data can be stored using a magnetic process. Data is stored as magnetic spots arranged in columns on the magnetic tape. Magnetic tapes are sequential access devices.
b) Magnetic disks

A flat circular platter on which data can be stored using magnetic process i.e. data is stored inform of magnetic charges on a metal oxide film that coats the surface of the disk. Magnetic disks are of two types:
i.) Floppy disk and
ii.) Hard Disk.

\section*{Hard disk}

Thin but rigid metal plate covered with a substance that allows data to be held in the form of magnetized spots. The disk is tightly sealed within an enclosed hard disk drive to prevent any foreign matter from getting inside. Data is recorded on both sides of the platter. In micro computers are located inside the system unit. The advantage of a hard disk over a floppy disk is that the hard disk allows a faster access to data than floppy disks because it spins faster than floppy disks. Hard disk have high data storage capacity than the floppy disks. The limitation of hard disk to floppy disk is that if any foreign matters into the disk drive the read/write head comes into contact with the disk and thus causing a head crash. We have two types of hard disks: internal hard disk and external hard disks

\section*{c) Optical Disks}

Used for storing large quantities of data like videos. In optical technology, a laser beam alters the surface of a plastic disk to represent data. To read the data, a laser scans the areas and sends the data to a computer chip for conversion.

Unlike hard disks and floppy disks, which use magnetic spots to represent 1's and 0's, optical disks use laser beam of light. On a CD/DVD 1's and 0's are represented by flat areas and bumpy areas called pits on its bottom surface. The CD/DVD is read by a laser that projects a tiny beam of light on these areas. The amount of reflected light determines whether the area represents 1 or 0 .

Optical disks are of different types:
i.) CD - ROM: Compact disk read only Memory

CD-ROM is a read-only disc which cannot be written on or erased by the user. The discs are used to distribute software and any other data that is stored permanently.
ii.) CD - R: Compact Disk Recordable

A CD format that allows users to write data only once.
iii.)CD-RW: Compact Disk Rewritable/ Erasable Optical Disk

Allows users to record and erase data so that the disk can be used over and over again iv.) DVD: Digital Video/Versatile Disk

High density optical disks which are read and written by the laser beam. DVD's store much more data than standard CD's. The surface of a DVD contains microscopic pits which are smaller and closer to one together than those on a CD allowing for more information to be represented.
v.) Blu-ray

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Blu-ray is a high-definition optical format that offer 25 GB per layer with up to two layers per disc. Blu-ray discs have a protective coating that reduces the number of scratches and makes the disc durable.

\section*{d) Solid-state storage technology}

A Solid State storage is a type of computer storage media made from silicon microchips. It stores data electronically instead of magnetically or optically. It has no moving parts thus uses much less power and provides better performance than a hard disk drive in an existing computer system. It is also used for new computer or embedded system designs which require smaller physical size, removability, lower power, higher performance and/or a lower price.
Solid State Storage can be found in three form factors: Solid State Drives, Solid State Cards, and Solid State Modules

Example of devices; USB flash drive, Flash memory and micro flash memory cards, Solid state drive (SSD)

\section*{ii.) Starting a computer}
$\checkmark$ Before switching on a computer, make sure that all the components are properly connected, and that the computer is connected to an active power source.
$\checkmark$ Turn on the switch at the source of the power supply. If your computer is connected to a constant voltage Stabilizer or an uninterrupted power supply (UPS), turn it on after switching the main supply.
Functions of the UPS
- It regulates power from an unstable power source to the required clean stable voltage.
- It prevents power surges and brownouts that might destroy the computer.
- It temporarily provides power to the computer in case of the main power failure. This allows the user to save his/her work and shutdown the computer using the correct procedure.
- Alerts the user of any power loss (by beeping).
$\checkmark$ Press the power buttons on the System unit and the Monitor.
$\checkmark$ After the power is on, the computer automatically goes through a process called Booting. Booting is a term used to describe the starting up of a computer. It is the entire process that makes the computer ready for use.
Types of Booting.
$\checkmark$ There are 2 types of booting, namely;
a) Cold booting: This happens when a computer that was originally off is switched on by pressing the power button on the system unit.
b) Warm booting: This happens when a computer that was originally on is forced to restart by pressing the Restart button on the System unit or by pressing a combination of keys on the keyboard (Ctrl+Alt+Del). In Windows operating systems, one can use the Restart option on the Shutdown dialog box to perform a warm boot.

\subsection*{3.0 COMPUTER SOFTWARE}

Software is a general term given to programs and related data that provide the instructions for telling computer hardware what to do and how to do it. The two main classifications of software that all programs fit under are:

- Software Suites
- Word Processors
- Spreadsheets
- Presentation Graphics
- Database Management Systems
- Desktop Publishing
- Integrated Packages
- Web Browsers

\section*{SYSTEM SOFTWARE}

System software is computer software designed to operate the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software. These are programs, with associated documentation, that control the way the computer operates or provide facilities that extend the general capabilities of the system. The programs manage the operation of the computer itself, and makes sure that the computer works efficiently. Categories of system software are:
a) Firm ware
b) Operating system
c) System utilities
d) Programming language translators

\section*{FIRMWARE}

Programs made by the manufacturer of the computer system and their main aim is to initialize the hardware, so that the operating system can be able to manage them. It is normally held in Read Only Memory.

\section*{OPERATING SYSTEM}

A group of programs that manages and supervises all the hardware and software resources on the computer.

A software that manages the computer hardware and allows a user to run applications on a computing device.
They are developed to manage all parts of the basic computer hardware \& provide an interface to users and their programs.
Operating systems provide a software platform on top of which other programs, called application programs can run. The application program must be written to run on top of a particular operating system.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_50a71b8b74d0265083b9g-024.jpg?height=260&width=1033&top_left_y=759&top_left_x=375)

The operating system is an interface between the hardware and Application Software which in turn interfaces users

\section*{Functions of the operating system}

The general functions of the operating system are:

\section*{1. Processor Management.}

The processor is a scarce resource. It executes tasks called Processes which are further broken into lightweight tasks called Threads.

A Multi-tasking computer system can run several applications simultaneously. At times, several tasks may require processing, hence creating competition. However, the CPU can only execute one program at any one time.
Therefore, access to the CPU must be carefully controlled \& monitored. The OS must decide, which program will be allowed into the CPU, and for how long.

To do this, the OS arranges the tasks according to priority and has the ability to stop a particular task to allow the processor to service another task.

\section*{2. Memory allocation \& loading of programs.}

Programs must be loaded into memory (RAM) before they can be executed, and moved out of memory when they are no longer required. Therefore, before processing starts, the OS ensures that the programs are transferred into the available memory location in the Main memory from the secondary storage, e.g. a hard disk.

At any one given time, a number of tasks may require the memory so that they can be accessed \& processed by the computer. The computer memory is a scarce resource, and therefore, the OS must determine which task will remain in memory awaiting for execution and which one will be sent back to secondary storage to wait.

The OS keeps track of what parts of memory are in use and by which program, and what parts are free.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{3. Input/output devices management.}

Every computer has many Input \& Output (I/O) devices. The OS controls the input from \& output to the various devices. It also tries to monitor the state of each I/O device and signals any faults detected.
During the course of their execution, programs will request the use of an Input or Output device. In a multi-user system, conflicts are likely to occur when one program requests a device that is being used by another program. Therefore, the OS will control allocation of I/O devices and attempt to resolve any conflicts that arise.
Because most input/output devices are slower than the processor, the OS has to control the flow of data from the time of input to the time the user receives it as information. It ensures that the right data reaches the processor at the right time.
The OS also defines the various input/output ports found on the computer, e.g., printer port.
4. Management of secondary storage devices.

The OS manages the storage \& retrieval of data on secondary storage devices. It also utilizes the free space on hard disks to enhance the performance of the computer by temporarily holding tasks on it that were in RAM ready for processing but have to wait for sometime.

\section*{5. File management.}

The OS is concerned with the logical organization of the information (the File System) and provides a means through which files can be sorted, retrieved \& shared.

It also provides a means of protecting data files \& programs against unauthorized access and corruption.
6. Job scheduling.

The OS arranges \& loads programs in order to provide a continuous sequence of processing \& also provide the appropriate responses to events.

The processor can handle only one task at a time. Therefore, in a situation where more than one application program is occupying the main storage, the OS has to determine which task will be processed first and ensures that the one that is currently being processed is closely monitored to avoid wasting time in the processor.

The jobs are allocated priorities so as to ensure that there is continuous processing until all the jobs within the memory are executed. This ensures that the CPU does not remain idle at any given instance.
7. Job sequencing.

The OS keeps a list of jobs/tasks currently being run and monitors them as they move in \& out of the processor. It also arranges them in a particular order to make it easy for the processor to execute them and to know how \& when to fetch instructions \& data for each task.

\section*{8. Resource control and allocation.}

The OS controls the selection \& operation of hardware devices used for input, output and storage.

The OS determines which task uses a particular resource and at what time. To do this, it gives each resource a unique identification number called an Interrupt number so that, when two tasks request to use a resource at the same time, the one with higher priority interrupt is granted control.

This prevents an undesirable situation called deadlock that occurs when a particular task holds a needed resource \& refuses to release it for use by other tasks.
9. Error reporting \& correction routines.

The OS has many ways of reporting to the user of any errors that occur during program execution. It does this by monitoring the status of the computer system \& performing error checks on both hardware and software.

When the user makes an error, the OS through the Kernel determines the cause of the error, and prints diagnostic messages on the screen suggesting appropriate routines of how the error can be corrected.

In case of a fatal error that cannot be corrected, the program will be suspended permanently. E.g., the user program will prematurely terminate when it encounters an illegal operation, such as, dividing a no. by 0 or if it attempts to read a data file that had not been opened.

\section*{10. Interrupt handling.}

An Interrupt is a break from the normal sequential processing of instructions in a program.
Each hardware device communicates to the processor using a special number called the Interrupt Request number (IRQ). Therefore, when an interrupt occurs, control is passed to the Kernel, which determines the cause of the interrupt. The processor stops executing the current program to wait for the corrective response of the user. Control is returned to the program that was interrupted once corrective action has been taken.

Some causes of Interrupt.
a) An Interrupt caused by Power failure.

The Kernel saves vital information using the dying power supply so that it can be restarted when power is returned.
b) Arithmetic or logic errors.

When the ALU detects that an error has occurred, (e.g., the output may be requested to a non-existent device) it generates a signal that causes an interrupt. Control is transferred to the Kernel, which indicates the appropriate error correction routines.
c) Hardware malfunction, e.g. parity errors.

The I/O control for each device \& its associated hardware normally takes care of parity checking. If a parity error is detected, the Kernel is notified by an interrupt.
Device driver - a software that the OS uses to control a specific piece of hardware.

\section*{11. Interfaces the user to the system's hardware.}

The OS provides quick means of communication between the computer user \& its programs.
The user requests the services of the OS by use of commands \& the OS communicates the messages regarding the processing to the user through, either the screen or printer. Thus, a form of 'conversation' is established between the OS \& the computer user.

\section*{12. Logging \& Accounting.}

The OS keeps records (internal logs) on how the computer's resources, e.g., CPU time, memory usage, \& the peripherals are being used. It also keeps a complete record of all that happens during processing (usually in the form of a printed $\log$ ).

\section*{Types of Operating System}

The operating system determines the type of processing that a computer system is able to perform, since it controls the allocation and use of the computer resources. There are different types of operating systems depending on;
i.) The number of users it can support / The number of tasks it can perform simultaneously,
ii.) The type of Processing and
iii.) The user interface.

\section*{Number of Users it can support}
a) Single-Users / Single - Tasking Operating System

It's designed to be used by one user at a time. E.g. DOS (Disk Operating System), Windows 95/98, e.t.c.
b) Multi-User/Multitasking Operating System

Designed to handle more than one user at a time a phenomenon called MultiProgramming. Examples of multi-user operating systems include UNIX, Linux, and Windows NT/200/2003

\section*{Type of processing}

The basic types of processing modes are;
a) Batch processing (Offline Processing):- this is a processing mode whereby the transactions are accumulated over a period of time and then processed at a pre-specified time to produce a batch of output.
b) Online Processing: In this processing mode, data is collected, transmitted to the computer over some form of a network and processed immediately it is received. Example: When booking a seat on an airline, the seat is booked immediately. This is to avoid problems of double-booking. Other example of online processing is when playing computer games online
c) Real-time Processing-

In real time processing the computer processes the incoming data as soon as it occurs, updates the transaction file and gives an immediate response that would affect the events as they happen.
Used mostly in process control.
There is no much difference with online processing however with real-time processing, the outcome of the processing is required immediately to influence decision making and not necessarily through online means but can be within a machine.
Example: in nuclear power stations, a certain level of temperature is required to be maintained for effective disintegration of atoms. If the temperatures are not controlled, the system may cause an emergency situation- like in increase or decrease in slight temperature fluctuations, therefore computers are used to control the air conditioning systems at the plant because they are programmed to provide instant answers upon a slight change in temperature has occurred- that is what we call real-time processing
d) Interactive processing- this is where the operating system relies on a lot of input from the user. In the interactive approach to hardware system design the data is processed individually and continuously as transactions take place and output is generated instantly.
e) Time Sharing Processing: a processing mode in which case the central processing unit serves two or more users with different processing requirements (tasks). Processor's time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing. The
central computer is therefore, available to a variety of users, connected to the central computer via communications links, who may wish to process their data and receive information. The computer works upon the user request (tasks) and the results are communicated back to the workstation via communication links.
f) Distributed Processing:-

These points to dividing (distributing) processing tasks to two or more computers that are located on physically separate sites but connected by data transmission media; there may be a central computer that receives input from the remote computers (terminals), processes the data and updates the master file. If required, the output can be communicated back to the remote terminals.
Example: When you withdraw money from a bank, your records are transacted and updated in the main server computer which will also update client computers across the bank branches divide.

\section*{Interface}

This is the communication point between the computer and the computer system. It is the user controllable part of the operating system that allows the user to communicate or interact with it.
a) Command line system: Are those that require the user to type a command on a command line. Example is DOS Operating System
b) Menu Driven Operating System: here the interface is made up of different types of menus. The simplest menu provides the user with a list of program commands displayed on-screen and a simple means of selecting between them.
c) Graphical User Interface Operating System: Is the one which the commands appear like small pictures on the screen called icons. A command is issued by pointing an arrow to the icon using a pointing device like a mouse and then pressing the select button on the device. Example includes Windows XP, Windows Vista, Apple Macintosh, UNIX, Linux, e.t.c.

\section*{Examples of Operating Systems}
i) Microsoft Windows Operating System

It was called windows simply because all applications in the operating system run in rectangular boxes called windows.
When windows is running on the computer it has the following features;
a) The windows desktop

The desktop is the rectangular area on the screen that displays all the icons that are needed to access the information and the resources in the computer system. A typical window desktop will have the following icons;
- My computer icon
- The recycle bin icon
- The start button icon
- The task bar icon
- The system tray icon
b) The mouse ( or other pointing device)

The mouse is an input device which is used to move a pointer on the screen by sliding it on a flat surface. Some of the operations associated to the mouse are; double clicking, right clicking, dragging, left clicking, e.t.c.
ii) Macintosh Operating system

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

The Macintosh operating system runs only on Apple Macintosh computers. It is a graphical user interface operating system that allows multitasking. Macintoshes are built around microprocessors made by Motorola unlike the Windows PC's which are built around Intel Microprocessors.
iii) Unix operating system

It's a multitasking, multi-user, network management operating system whose portability allows it to run on mainframes, midrange computers, and microcomputers.
iv) Linux operating system

\section*{UTILITY SOFTWARE (SERVICE PROGRAMS).}

A Utility program is a program, which performs a generally useful task.
Utility programs are used by end-users to perform many of the routine functions \& operations such as, sorting, merging, program debugging, manage computer files, diagnose and repair computer problems that occur, managing memory, protecting the system from viruses, backing up files, restoring accidentally deleted files, etc.

They enable the computer to run more smoothly \& efficiently.

\section*{Examples of the common utility/Service programs.}
a) Text Editor.
b) Sort utility.
c) Debug Utility (Removing program errors)
d) Merge utility.
e) Copy utility.
f) Dump Utility. Dumping is used to describe the copying of the contents of the main memory. .
g) Language Translator.
h) Linker. Accepts separately translated program modules as its input and logically combines them into one logical module.
i) Loader.
j) Diagnostic Tools (Programs).

\section*{System Development Programs/Programming Languages}

A program is a set of instructions that the computer can understand. A computer program is written using a programming language that must be translated by a language translator into computers own machine language before they can be processed by the CPU. Programming language translators are known by a variety of names i.e.
a) An assembler. A program that translates the symbolic instructions written in assembly language into machine language instructions.
b) A compiler which is a program that translates high level language statements into machine language instructions.
c) An interpreter: a computer program that translates and execute a program statements line by line. It is a special type of compiler that translates and executes each statement in a program one at a time, instead of producing a complete machine language program, as compilers and assemblers do. Used by Programming languages like Java, Visual Basic
There are four categories of programming languages;
a) The First Generation Programming Languages/ Machine languages

These are programming languages understood directly by the computer. They allow people to construct letters, numbers, punctuations and other characters using a two-state system i.e. 1's and 0's. Data represented in 1's and 0's is said to be written in machine language. The language is hard for human beings to use and understand e.g. 11100111. They vary according to the make of the computer
b) The second generation Programming Languages/ Assembly Languages

A programming language that consists of instructions that are mnemonic codes for corresponding machine language instructions. Have advantage over the 1's and 0's of machine language because they use abbreviations or mnemonics e.g. ADD for addition, SUB for subtraction, e.t.c. They need an assembler for them to be translated to machine language. They are easier for human beings to remember compared to $1^{\text {st }}$ generation, but they are still pretty thus considered low level languages. $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ Generation languages are low level languages. Assembly languages also vary from the computer to the computer.
c) High Level /Procedural Programming Languages/ third generation programming languages
They are English like programming languages developed by the programmer in mind rather than the computer. They have simple instructions similar to English language that make it easy for human beings to understand, use and correct errors. Examples of high level programming languages are: BASIC, PASCAL, COBOL, C, and FORTRAN.
They are called procedural because they are designed to express the logic- the procedures that can solve general problems. They are usually translated to machine language using translators like a compiler and an interpreter.
d) Very High Level Programming Languages/ Problem Oriented Languages

Problem-oriented language is computer programming language designed to handle a particular class of problem. For example, COBOL was designed for business, FORTRAN for scientific and GPSS for simulation.
Third Generation programming languages require training in computer programming, but very high level programming languages require little special training on the part of the
user. Unlike 3rd generation languages $4^{\text {th }}$ generation languages are designed to solve specific problems. This group includes query languages and application generators
e) The Natural Languages / Fifth generation computer languages:

5GL's involve a computer which responds directly to spoken or written instructions or English language commands. 5 GL's are typically used in the artificial Intelligence (AI) Applications. Most of this application that use Artificial Intelligence Systems include; Deadly Weapon Manufacturing Systems.

\section*{APPLICATION SOFTWARE.}

Programs that are designed and written to meet user specific needs. Programs are written to solve specific problems (or to handle the needs) of the end-user in particular areas.

They interface between the user \& system programs to allow the user to perform specific tasks. Application software helps to solve the problems of the computer user, and are therefore said to be user-oriented.

Application software falls into 2 main categories/groups: -
i) General-purpose packages (Application packages).
ii) Special-purpose applications (User programs).

\section*{General-purpose packages (Application packages).}

These are applications created to meet a wide variety of user needs; therefore they are very popular, portable and need a very short time to learn. They are usually ready-made off-the- shelf packages.

There several groups of application packages in the world today;
i) Word Processors

Computer programs that enable a person to create, save, retrieve, edit and print text documents like letters, curriculum vitae, memorandums, books, pamphlets, e.t.c. Examples of Word processors are Microsoft Word, Word Perfect
ii) Spread sheets

Computer program in which data is arranged in a grid of rows and columns and can be manipulated and used in calculations. What makes a spreadsheet software program unique is its ability to calculate values using mathematical formulas and the data in cells . Examples of Spreadsheets are Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and OpenOfficeCalc, VisiCalc, Quattro Pro
iii) Database Management Systems

A database management system (DBMS) is a software for creating and managing databases. A database is an organized collection of related data. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data... They present the data to the user in understandable formats like reports, forms, and queries. Examples are Microsoft Access, Oracle Database, and Dbase IV, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgresql. Microsoft Fox Pro, Ingres
iv) Desktop Publishers

Programs that enable one to create publications e.g. newspapers, magazines, cards, brochures, newsletters, books, web pages, etc

Desktop publishing is the process of using software to combine text and graphics using page layout skills to produce publications. Examples are Adobe PageMaker, Microsoft Publisher, CorelDraw, Adobe InDesign, PagePlus
v) Presentation Graphics

Software suite: a group of different compatible applications sold by one software company. The programs are each individual applications, but they usually work in a similar manner, and have some common features, such as menu commands, buttons, or keystrokes.
Although each of the programs in a suite can be purchased separately, they cost less when purchased as a bundle. Typically, a suite includes a Word processor, a Spreadsheet, a Database, Presentation graphics applications, Personal Information Managers, and E-mail applications. The applications are integrated with one another, making it easy to use them together and to transfer data from one into the others.
E.g. of Software Suites are: - * Microsoft Office, * LotusSmart Suite, WordPerfect Suite.

\section*{SPECIAL-PURPOSE APPLICATIONS (User-developed/ in-house programs).}

Software written to meet the specific needs of an organization.
They are usually customized (modified/ tailored) programs written by the user or a Software house under contract, to perform a specific job within an organization.
They are developed by users to solve only the specific processing tasks in one organization, and may not suit the needs of other organizations, hence the name In-house or Tailor-made programs.
Since the programs are organization- specific; they sell fewer \& tend to be more expensive.
Factors to consider when buying an Application package.
a) Cost of the package in relation to the expected benefits against the cost of developing inhouse programs.

\subsection*{4.0 DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY}

Data Security is the practice of keeping data protected from corruption and unauthorized access. It involves the use of various methods to make sure that data is correct, kept confidential and is safe.

Data privacy refers to the right of individuals or organizations to deny or restrict the collection and use of information about them. It requires system managers to reduce unauthorized access into their systems by building physical arrangements and software checks.
Data is the raw form of information stored as columns and rows in our databases, network servers and personal computers. This may be a wide range of information from personal files and intellectual property to market analytics and details intended to top secret. E.g. bank account details.

Data security includes;
Ensuring integrity of data.
Ensuring privacy of data.
Prevent the loss or destruction of the data
Computer security is safeguarding computer and related documents from the risk of damage/fraud. It is keeping information private to ensure data security.

Computer security involves protection of data against accidental or deliberate threats which might cause unauthorized modification, disclosure or destruction of data and information system.

Computer Security - Why?
- information is a strategic resource
- a significant portion of organizational budget is spent on managing information

Have several security related objectives
- confidentiality (secrecy) - protect information value
- integrity - protect information accuracy
- availability - ensure information delivery

Threats to information security
Various surveys, with results of order:
- $55 \%$ human error
- $10 \%$ disgruntled employees
- $10 \%$ dishonest employees
- $10 \%$ outsider access

Security measures include;
- Fire proof cabinets, and lockable metal boxes for storage devices
- Have fire extinguishers and some fire detectors
- Training of fire officers
- Observation of safety procedures e.g. avoid smoking in computer rooms
b) Water/Flood and Moisture

This causes the metallic components of computer to rust
Security measures against this include;
- Setting up computer rooms on higher grounds to avoid floods
- Adequate drainage system and use of water proof ceiling and floors
- Avoid installation of components in the basement
c) Lightening, Electricity and electrical storms

g) Malwares

Short for malicious software.
Is software used or created to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
'Malware' is a general term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile, intrusive, or annoying software
Malware is malicious software that is intended to take control, damage, or corrupt computer systems.
Types of Malware:
Viruses, Trojan horses, Worms, Spyware, Zombie, Phishing, Spam, Adware, Ransomware, Backdoors, Loggers
Viruses: Program that is designed to spread from one computer to another and to interfere with computer operation. Viruses cannot replicate independently; they need to be transferred to another computer and run by a user. They can be transferred by various means, such as using deception to convince the user that the file they are opening is benign. Examples of computer viruses are: Macro virus, Boot virus, Logic Bomb virus, Directory virus.
Worms: Software that infects a computer and then replicates itself from system to system on its own without the help of a host file. The main feature that separates worms from viruses is that worms are self-replicating.
Trojan horses: Are applications which appear to be useful, legitimate applications, but run malicious, hidden code. The application may appear to perform tasks, such as scanning for spyware, but actually steal personal data from your system. Executing Trojans may result in changing desktop wallpaper, creating pop-ups, or even deleting files. One of their most popular uses is creating backdoors to allow malicious users to gain access to files and information. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans cannot infect other systems.

\section*{Phishing}
while not actually malware, phishing has recently become a real security concern. Users are directed to a seemingly trustworthy website and defrauded into giving up personal information, such as credit card details, passwords, etc.
Spyware: Spyware is a type of malware installed on computers that collects information about users without their knowledge. The presence of spyware is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Spyware programs lurk on your computer to steal important information, like your passwords and logins and other personal identification information and then send it off to someone else.
Adware - A type of malware that displays advertisements on your computer and collects data about your browsing habits without your consent.
Keylogger - Malicious software that tracks the keystrokes on a computer and transmits the data to another location so it can be used to detect usernames and passwords that are typed on a computer

Some measures taken to protect computer programs and offer data security are;
- Make back-up copies of data and programs and store the files offline. Data backup refers to making copies of data so that these additional copies may be used to restore the original after a data loss event.
- Be cautious of freeware and shareware
- Install antivirus programs e.g. AVG, MacAfee, Kaspersky, Norton. Check virus infiltration regularly
- Restrict access to programs and data using user accounts and passwords
- Restrict use of computer drives e.g. floppy disk, flash disk and compact disk drives unless one has outright authority
- Use of anti-spam ware, firewall, antispyware software's.
- Data encryption: The process of encoding information in an attempt to make it secure from unauthorized access, particularly during transmission. The reverse of this process is known as decryption.
- Firewall: A physical firewall keeps fire from spreading from one area to the next, similarly, with regard to computers a firewall is a program or hardware that filters information coming through the internet and connection into your personal computer or network. Firewalls can prevent unauthorized remote logins, limit or stop spam and filter the content that is downloaded from the internet. Some firewall offer virus protection.
h) Earthquakes, Smoke and dust

Loss or destruction of data can be prevented through:
a) Software Security

\section*{i. Encryption}

This security mechanism uses mathematical schemes and algorithms to scramble data into unreadable text. It can only by decoded or decrypted by the party that possesses the associated key.
ii. User Authentication. With authentication, users must provide a password, code, biometric data, or some other form of data to verify identity before access to a system or data is granted. E.g. one has to $\log$ in using a user name and a password. Once logged in, you have various given privileges until logging out. Some systems will cancel a session if your machine has been idle for a certain amount of time, requiring that you prove authentication once again to re-enter. You can also $\log$ in using a smart card, even a fingerprint, etc.

\section*{iii. Backup Solutions}

A backup is a duplicate of a file, program, or disk that can be used if the original is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Files can be restored by copying the backed up files to their original location on the computer. Backup copies should be kept in a fireproof and heatproof safe or offsite.
b) Hardware/Physical Security;
- Hiring of security guard to control access to the building or computer room
- Using keyboard lock on terminals used by authorized users, door locks
- Use of cooling system in a computer room
- Have dust mats, double door and monitoring devices to prevent entry of dust
- Have lightening arrestors
- Put computer rooms on high ground to avoid humidity.
- Installation of alarms, security lighting or closed-circuit television cameras, to make it likely that attacks will be noticed;

\section*{Computer Crime}

It is the commission of illegal acts through the use of a computer. It involves the use of computer hardware, software, or data for illegal activities, or the illegal use of computers. The most economically damaging computer crimes are the introduction of viruses, theft of services, disruption of computer systems and theft of telecommunication services. Other sources of computer crime are;
a) Input manipulators

Input clerks can manipulate input transactions e.g. they can create ghost employees on the salary file or supplier on the purchase file.
b) Program alteration

This is done by people with excellent programming skills with malice. They may liaise with others for selfish gains.
c) Alteration of data in a database

This is normally done by authorized database users e.g. one can alter prices on invoices, increase prices on selling products etc and pocket the surplus amounts.
d) Theft of computer time

Employees may use organizations computers to do their own work e.g. they may produce publication for selling using the company's computers
e) Data theft i.e. commercial espionage

Employees steal sensitive information or copy packages and sell them to outsiders or competitors for profit. This may lead to a leak of important information e.g. marketing information, research information or medical reports.
f) Sabotage

This is malicious destruction of the system or data by employees or other people with grudges.
g) Hackers and Crackers

A Cracker is a person who breaks in to a security system only with a malicious intent. A person who breaks in to a computer system for the purpose of earning profit, finding security loopholes of the system, showing protest or just for the sake of challenge is called a hacker.

\section*{Biometrics: An emerging technology on security:}

Biometrics is defined as the science of using digital technology to verify a person's identity based on physical and biological traits such as fingerprints and unique eye features. It can provide a high level of security while eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).

Common biometrics characteristics can be classified into physiological and behavioral biometrics.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\section*{ERGONOMICS}

It is the science and technology emphasizing the safety, comfort, and ease use of human operated machines such as computers. The goal of ergonomics is to produce systems that are user-friendly: safe, comfortable, and easy to use. It is concerned with designing computer hardware and software as well as office furniture that is less stressful and more comfortable to use that blends more smoothly with a person's body or actions.

Ergonomics helps computer users take steps to avoid physical and mental health risks and to increase productivity hence it can be defined as sturdy of human factors related to computers.

Ergonomics is the study of designing equipment and devices that fit the human body, its movements, and its cognitive abilities.

\subsection*{5.0 NETWORKING AND INTERNET}

\section*{Definition of Terms}
- Computer Network is a collection of computers linked together for the purpose of communication and resource sharing.
The term transmission media refers to any physical or non-physical link between two or more computers and in which a signal can be made to flow from source to destination.
Some of the shared resources include application programs, printers, fax machines, modems, storage devices, databases, an email system etc.
All networks must have the following:
- A resource to share (resource)
- A pathway to transfer data (transmission medium)
- A set of rules governing how to communicate (protocols)
- Data Communication: the process of transmitting data signal from one point to another through the network.
- Data signal: A pulse or frequency of electricity or light that represents data as it travels over a network, a computer channel or wireless. Data signals can either be analog or digital in nature. Analog data is made up of continuous varying waveform while digital data is made up of a non-continuous discrete signal.
- Signal Modulation and Demodulation: this the process of converting data signals to and from a form that is suitable for transmission over a transmission medium. E.g. A modem converts digital signal to analogue signal which can be transmitted over analogue telephone lines a process called modulation. A modem at the receiving end converts the analog signals into digital form, a process known as demodulation.
- Multiplexing: Is the process of sending multiple data signals over the same medium e.g. a wire conductor can be made to carry several data signals either simultaneously or at different times. Demultiplexing is the process of separating multiplexed signals at the receiving end.
- Bandwidth: the maximum amount of data that a transmission medium can carry at any one time. Usually given in bits per second.
- Attenuation: This is the decrease in magnitude and energy as a signal progressively moves along transmission medium. If the signal is not boosted, it will totally be lost along the way and may never reach the destination.
- Node: any device that is attached to a network e.g. printer, scanner, computer, e.t.c.
- Internet: also called National information superhighway. The world's largest computer network that allows almost all computers and other devices worldwide to connect and exchange information.
- Intranet: is a computer network that uses Internet Protocol technology to share information, or computing services within an organization.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

An intranet is a system similar to the Internet, but restricted within an organization's computer network e.g. the Strathmore Intranet (http://athi/strathmore): Managed according to organizational policies, used to share documents among employees, Communicate organizational policies and procedures and used to generally maintain organizational knowledge.
- Extranet: An extension of internal network (Intranet) to connect not only internal personnel but also selected customers, suppliers and other strategic offices.
An extranet is a private network that uses Internet technology to securely share part of a business's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. An extranet can be viewed as part of a company's intranet that is extended to users outside the company. An extranet requires security and privacy. These can include firewall server management, the issuance and use of digital certificates or similar means of user authentication, encryption of messages, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that tunnel through the public network.

\section*{Types of Computer Networks}

Computer networks can be characterized by their size as well as their purpose. The size of a network can be expressed by the geographic area they occupy and the number of computers that are part of the network. Networks can cover anything from a handful of devices within a single room to millions of devices spread across the entire globe.
Some of the different networks based on size are:
- Personal area network, or PAN
- Local area network, or LAN
- Metropolitan area network, or MAN
- Wide area network, or WAN

In terms of purpose, many networks can be considered general purpose, which means they are used for everything from sending files to a printer to accessing the Internet. Some types of networks, however, serve a very particular purpose. Some of the different networks based on their main purpose are:
- Storage area network, or SAN
- Enterprise private network, or EPN
- Virtual private network, or VPN
i) Wide Area Network

Covers a large geographical area (sites) such as a country, a continent or the whole world. You could drive there, but it would be hard to do so and return in the same day.
It involves the LANs and MANs. It uses greater varieties of transmission technology and media. E.g. telephones network, satellite links and internet. They transfer data at lower speeds (lower bandwidth).
ii) Metropolitan Area Network

Network of computers and other devices within a medium geographical area e.g. urban region or town. In a MAN size network you cannot easily walk there, but you can drive there and back in a short while.
iii) Local Area Network

Network of computers and other devices confined in relatively small/limited Geographical area e.g. a room or in a building. It is usually a private network (Connectivity Resources eg Transmission media are owned and managed by the company running the LAN). They transfer data at high speeds.
iv) Campus Area Network

Connects LANS that are located in separate buildings that are near to each other (Near means that you can walk to each building and back without much trouble).
CAN may also connect LANs on several floors in a tall building.
v) Personal Area Network

A small network which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth enabled devices or infrared enabled devices. E.g. Piconet is Bluetooth enabled PAN which may contain up to 8 devices connected together in a master-slave fashion.

\section*{Network architecture}
a) Peer-to- peer Network

This is a type of network where all the computers on the network have equal processing capability. It is a network that does not have a server. This type of networks are easy to manage, do not require expertise and are less expensive.
b) Client- Server Network

A network that has a one superior computer that serves other computers (Clients) on the network. The superior computer is called the server and it must be installed with Network Operating System for it to function. Examples of Network Operating System include Microsoft Windows Server 2000, 2003, Novel, Windows NT, UNIX, Linux, e.t.c.

\section*{Advantages of Networks}
- Resource Sharing: e.g. sharing of data/information, files, printers, modems, communication links, storage devices, fax machines, application programs, e.t.c.
- Remote Communication: It is the transmission of data signals between two communication devices located at different locations. Remote communication has been made possible by use of wireless transmission such as radio waves, microwaves and satellites. Remote communication gives a lot of flexibility in working like telecommuting, teleshopping and video-conferencing.
- Distributed processing facility: Computers on the network can share tasks and finally update the server. E.g. for a distributed processing system in an organization, branch offices have their own computer servers that store data, information and other resources required for daily operations. This servers then periodically update the central computer.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Cost effectiveness: Although the initial purchase and laying down of network components may be expensive, the savings experienced and value added to service delivery make them a ready choice since they are cost effective. E.g. costs of hardware and software can be minimized through sharing on the network.
- Reliability: E.g. data can be transferred with minimum error from source to destination, in case one computer breaks down, a user can still access data and information from the other computers using other computers on the network.

\section*{Limitations of Networking}
- Less secure: data and information held on a network is prone to illegal access threats than if the computer was on the network. Also when information is sent over the network from source to destination, it can be tapped or listened to by unauthorized parties.
- High initial costs: the costs include buying hardware and software and employing staff to maintain the network.
- Moral and Cultural effect: Large networks like the internet have chat rooms, and messaging services that enable underage children to meet peers and adults on the net some of whom may have bad intentions. Access to pornographic material, drugs and substance abuse has widely been noticed on the internet.
- Spread of computer viruses

\section*{Transmission Direction}

Data Transmission occurs in three directions: Simplex, Half- duplex or full Duplex.
- Simplex: it refers to communication in only one direction. It uses only one circuit in one direction only similar to a public address system, TV Broadcast and radio.
- Half Duplex: It refers to communication in both directions but one direction at a time. it also uses one circuit, but it is used in both directions at a time, for example the police radio call where users can receive or transmit, but cannot do both simultaneously.
- Full Duplex: it uses two circuits for communication; one for each direction simultaneously e.g. the common telephone.

\section*{Transmission Mode}

Data transmission can either be synchronous or a synchronous.
- Synchronous: A transmission method that uses a clock signal to regulate data flow. In synchronous transmissions, frames are separated by equal-sized time intervals. Timing must be controlled precisely on the sending and the receiving computers. Special characters are embedded in the data stream to begin synchronization and to maintain synchronization during the transmission, allowing both computers to check for and correct any variations in timing.
- Asynchronous: A method of data transmission that uses start bits and stop bits to coordinate the flow of data so that the time intervals between individual characters do not need to be equal. Parity also may be used to check the accuracy of the data received.

\section*{ELEMENTS OF COMPUTER NETWORKING}

A computer network is made up of several standard elements (components) which can be classified into:
- Data communication Media
- Communication Devices
- Networking Software
- Data Signal

\section*{Data Communication Media}

This is the pathway used for carrying data and information from one point to another. The communication media dictates the type of signal that will be used to transmit a message. Data communication media can be divided into:
i) Communication using cable (Bounded Media)
ii) Wireless Communication(Unbounded Media)

\section*{Communication Using Cables}

The main distinguishing characteristic of bounded media is that data signals are transmitted from the source to the destination through a restricted pathway such as through a cable. Most common types of bounded media transmission are;
i.) Power Line Communication (PLC)
ii.) Twisted Pair Cables
iii.) Coaxial Cables
iv.) Fibre Optic Cables

\section*{Twisted Pair Cables}

It is made up of two copper wire strands wounded around each other in a double helix manner. This cables are mostly used to transmit both voice and data. The two common types of twisted pair cables are;
i) Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable(UTP)
ii) Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP)

ii) Installation equipment is cheap and readily available.

Disadvantages of Twisted Pair Cables
i) It suffers high attenuation
ii) It is sensitive to electromagnetic interference and eavesdropping
iii) It has low data transmission rates as compared to other cables

\section*{Coaxial Cables}

Coaxial cable gets its name because two conductors share a common axis; the cable is most frequently referred to as a "coax." A type of coaxial cable that you may be familiar with is the one that connects your television set and the TV antennae.
Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two cooper conductors, but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this construction, and special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable has high bit rates. Coaxial cable is quite common in cable television systems.

Advantages
i) They have large bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps ) compared to twisted pair
ii) They can carry voice, data and video signal simultaneously
iii) They are more resistant to radio and electromagnetic interference than twisted pair cables.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i) Coaxial cables are relatively expensive to buy and install as compared to twisted pair.

\section*{Fibre Optic Cables}

Consists of strands of light conducting cable. The core made from either a slender cylinder of glass fiber, or a bundle of glass fibers, or plastic. Cladding surrounds the core, protecting it. Signals are transmitted as light pulses at the speed of light. Two strands are needed; one to transmit, the other to receive. Fibre Optic Cables are of two types:
i) Single Mode Fibre
ii) Multimode Fibre

Single mode fiber can carry a single ray of light whereas multimode is capable of carrying multiple beams of light.

\section*{Advantages of Fibre Optic Cable}
i) It is immune to interference and eavesdropping (The process of gathering information about a target network by listening in on transmitted data).
ii) It is fast and supports high bandwidth
iii) Large distance can be covered because it has low attenuation
iv) It is smaller and lighter than copper cable hence ideal for space limited situations

\section*{Disadvantages of fibre optic cable}
i) Connectivity devices and the media are expensive
ii) It is relatively complex to configure

\section*{Cable Selection Criteria}
- Bandwidth - Information Carrying Capacity of a network measured in bits per second.
- Budget - how much money can be spent?
- Capacity - how much traffic must be carried?
- Environmental conditions - interference?
- Placement - space for cable in walls?
- Scope - how many devices will be connected?
- Span - what distances will be covered?

\section*{Wireless communication Media}

Is a type of media that is used to transmit data from one point to another without using physical connections. In this case the transmitting antenna and the receiving antennae facilitate communication. Examples of wireless transmission media include microwaves, radio waves and infrared transmission all which use different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.

\section*{Wireless Communication Technologies}

The term wireless refers to the communication or transmission of information over a distance without requiring wires, cables or any other electrical conductors.
The electromagnetic spectrum is the complete spectrum (or continuum) of all forms of "light". An electromagnetic wave consists of electric and magnetic fields which vibrate - thus making waves. The electromagnetic spectrum consists of: radio waves, microwaves, radar waves, infrared waves, visible light waves, ultraviolet waves, x-ray waves, gamma waves. Properties of electromagnetic waves include speed, frequency and wavelength.
Gamma waves are more dangerous than radio waves because they have a higher frequency and carry more energy
Advantages of wireless communications
- Ease of Integration and Convenience - The wireless nature of such networks allows users to access network resources from nearly any convenient location.
- Mobility - With the emergence of public wireless networks, users can access the internet even outside their normal working environment.
- Expandability - Wireless networks are capable of serving a suddenly-increased number of clients with the existing equipment. In a wired network, additional clients require additional wiring.
- Wireless media is flexible in operation as compared to bounded media i.e. devices can be moved around without losing access to the network
- Wireless networks can span large geographical areas easily
- Wireless communication can take place in very remote areas that do not have physical infrastructure like fibre optic cables

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Radio Frequency transmission and wireless networking signals are subjected to a wide variety of interference including the complex propagation effects that are beyond the control of the network administrator.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Security Problems - One can easily tap signals illegally. Wireless networks may choose to utilize some of the various encryption technologies.
- The speed on most wireless networks will be slower than the slowest common wired networks. Wireless Networks have limited communication bandwidth
- Installation of an infrastructure-based wireless network is a complex to set up.
- Range will be insufficient for a larger structure - and, in order to increase its range, repeaters or additional access points have to be purchased.

\section*{Wireless Networks}

Personal Area Networks:
- Bluetooth technology uses radio waves to communicate between devices. The pairing process identifies and connects any two devices to each other. It also prevents interference from other non-paired Bluetooth devices in the area. It uses maximum power only when it is required, thus preserving battery life.
- Infrared is a media transmission system that transmits data signals through light emitting diodes (LEDs) or Lasers. Infrared is an electromagnetic energy at a wavelength which is longer than that of the red light. The information cannot travel through obstacles in an infrared system, also can be inhibited by light. One type of infrared is the point to point system in which transmission is possible between two points limited to a range and line of sight.
- PAN include wireless computer keyboard \& mouse, wireless printers \& speakers, etc

Wireless LANs
- WiFi Networks:

WiFi or Wireless Fidelity, has a range of about 100 m and allows for faster data transfer rate between $10-54 \mathrm{Mbps}$. There are three different wireless standards under WiFi , $802.11 \mathrm{a}, 802.11 \mathrm{~b}$ and 802.11 g . 802. WiFi is used to create wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). The standards are relatively inexpensive and can be found providing wireless connectivity in airports, railway stations, cafes, bars, restaurants and other public areas. Wi-Fi has high data transfer rate compared to Bluetooth. In a Wi-Fi setup, a wireless router serves as the communication hub
Wireless MANs
- WiMaX: (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a technology standard for long-range wireless networking.
Wireless WANs
- Cellular Networks: GSM, GPRS, CDMA, 2G, 3G, 4G, HSDPA
- Satellite Networks:
- Satellite communication is one of the wireless technologies, which is widely spread all over the world allowing users to stay connected virtually anywhere on the Earth. The Satellites used in this mode of communication, communicate directly with the orbiting satellites via radio signals. Portable satellite phones and modems have more powerful broadcasting abilities than the cellular devices as
they have high range, apart from being more expensive in terms of cost, than their counterparts.
- For example, for outfitting a ship through satellite communication, a traditional communication system is linked to a single satellite, which allows multiple users to share the same broadcast equipment.

\section*{COMMUNICATION DEVICES}

This involves the hardware components associated with networking namely:
- Network Interface Card (NIC): they create a physical link between the computer and the transmission media. A computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.
- Repeaters: It connects similar segments of a network. They repeat and boost the signal transmission across similar media. Networking device used to regenerate or replicate a signal.
- Hub: This acts as connection between nodes. It connects nodes on a network and is able to relay signals from one computer to another on the same network. Unlike a switch or router, a hub has no routing table or intelligence on where to send information and instead, the hub broadcasts all network data across each connection.
- Switch: Switches not only connect nodes in network segments but also connects network segments. Whereas a hub forwards the data it receives to all of the ports on the network, a switch forwards it only to the port that connects to the destination device. The switch creates a point-to-point channel between two devices.
- A bridge is a device that connects dissimilar LAN segments. A part from extending a network it contains a filtering database that filters to the right network segment.
- Routers: it is a special device that directs communicating messages from one LAN to another and communicate with each other and share information that allows them determine the best route through several LANS.
- Gateway: is an interface that combines the hardware and software to enable dissimilar (incompatible) networks to communicate such as a LAN and a WAN or two LANS based on different topologies or network operating system. A device used to connect networks operating under different protocols.
- Access Point: Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a hardware device that allows devices to connect through a wireless standard, including Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. WAPs feature radio transmitters and antennae, which facilitate connectivity between the devices and the network. A WAP is also known as a hotspot.
- Wireless Router: A device that performs the functions of a router and also includes the functions of a wireless access point. A device that enables a wireless network packet forwarding and routing, and serves as an access point in a WLAN.
- Wireless Adapters: Wireless adapters are hardware devices that are installed inside computers which enables wireless connectivity. If a computer does not have a wireless adapter, it will not be able to connect to a router in order to access the Internet. Some computers have wireless adapters built directly into the motherboard, while it is also
possible to install stand-alone wireless adapters to add wireless capability to a computer that doesn't have a built-in facility.
- Wireless Repeater: A wireless networking device that is used to extend the range of a wireless router. A repeater receives wireless signals and amplifies the strength of the signals, and then re-emits them. The strength of the signal can be increased by placing a repeater between the router and the computer connected to the router.

\section*{Protocols}

Are set rules and procedures that govern communication between two different devices or people. In computer networking, protocols refers to the rules and technical procedures that govern communication between different computers. Examples of protocols are;
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - an internet protocol for transferring e-mails.
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP): An internet protocol for file transfer
- Transmission Control Protocol: responsible for delivery of sequenced data over the network
- Internet Protocol (IP): routes message using IP address assigned to each computer
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Uses hyperlinks to link pages in the text documents.
Network Protocols are designed basing on OSI reference Model or IP Protocol Stack

\section*{Network Topologies}

The term topology refers to the way in which computers and other devices have been arranged or how data is passed from one computer to another in the network.

Logical Topology or signal Topology deals with the way data passes from one device to the next on the network. Examples include Ethernet (CSMA/CA) and Token Ring topologies.

Physical Topology: Refers to physical layout or arrangement of components on the network. Examples of physical topologies include star, bus, ring, mesh and tree/hierarchical topology.

\section*{Star Topology}

All the devices on the network are connected to a central hub. Nodes communicate across the network by passing data through the hub.

Advantage of star topology
- The network control is centered at one place - easy to control
- The network intelligence is limited to the central work station (Cost effective)
- The many stations connected to the central processor can use the CPU processing of the central workstation.
- Easy to configure

\section*{Disadvantages of Star topology}
- Congestion at the central workstation can slow transmission
- Failure of the central workstation renders the network useless
- Workstations can only communicate with each other by going through the central workstation - unnecessary delays e.g. during congestion).
- Virus spread is easy hence - security is compromised.
- All workstations have their own communication media, which can become very expensive.
- The central workstation has a physical limitation for the number of workstations that can be connected.

\section*{Bus Topology}

All devices are connected to a central cable called the bus. A terminator is attached to each end of the cable to avoid signals from bouncing back and forth on the cable causing signal distortion.

\section*{Advantages of bus topology}
- It is easy to install -adding and removing stations is easy
- The loss of one workstation does not affect the functionality of the network.
- High transmission speeds possible

\section*{Disadvantages}
- The approach is appropriate for a smaller geographical area ( 2 Km )
- Administration of the network is difficult because of the peer to peer connections.

\section*{Ring Topology}

All devices are connected to one another in the shape of a closed loop. A token is used to exchange data from one station to another.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Modification may be difficult because adding or removing a device can disrupt the entire network.
- One device or media breakdown may affect the entire network. Failure of any host results in failure of the whole ring. Thus, every connection in the ring is a point of failure.

\section*{Mesh Topology}

Every node has a connection to every other node in the network.
Advantages
- The network can still operate when a node breaks down or a connection breaks.
- Point to point connections optimize throughput of data

\section*{Disadvantages}
- It is expensive on cable due to redundant links
- Administration of the network is difficult because of the peer to peer connections.

\section*{Tree Topology}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Also Hierarchical Topology. This topology imitates as extended Star topology and inherits properties of bus topology. The network is divided into multiple levels / layers of network i.e. root of the tree from which all nodes fork.

\section*{Hybrid Topology}

A network structure whose design contains more than one topology. The combining topologies may contain attributes of star, ring, bus and Mesh topologies. Internet is an example Hybrid topology. Hybrid Topology inherits merits and demerits of all the incorporating technologies.

\section*{INTERNET}

Also called National Information Superhighway or simply the "Net". Internet is a huge computer network available to nearly everyone who has a computer and a means to connect it. It is a network of networks or internetwork.

Nobody owns the Internet, Nobody polices the Internet, There is no one central computer or computers running the Internet and It is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once.

Applications of the internet (Uses of Internet)
- Communication e.g. Transferring Information through Electronic Mail, discussion groups, chat groups, debates, e.t.c.
- File Transfer/Copying Files from remote databases. E.g. you can download antivirus software and application software from the internet.
- Running programs on remote computers.
- Information: World Wide Web is a global system of linked web pages, containing information- text, pictures, sound, and videos e.t.c. WWW is a worldwide library, providing access to scholars worldwide e.g. professors.
You can review newspapers, magazines, academic papers, e.t.c.
Governments, colleges, universities, colleges, universities, companies and individuals all offer free information on the internet.
- Entertainment: You can Play Games on the Internet, watch videos, watch jokes, listen to music radio stations, watch football matches, e.t.c.
- Online shopping: you can order and pay for goods and services on the internet and the goods be delivered to you physically - teleshopping, e-commerce.
- Marketing
- Social Media. Instant Messaging. Blogging.

\section*{FACILITIES NEEDED TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET}
i) Computer: with fast processor, High quality color screen, and large amount of RAM and Hard disk storage capacity.
ii) Web Browsers: Programs installed on the computer that are used to retrieve web pages from the internet onto your computer. E.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, morzila fire fox, opera, e.t.c.
iii) Internet Service Provider: a commercial organization that provides internet connections, along with a set of support services for a fee. Examples of ISP's are Africa Online, Kenya Web, ISP Kenya, Swift Global, Africa Online, Access Kenya, safaricom, Airtel, Kenya data networks, e.t.c.

\section*{SERVICES OF INTERNET - E-mail, FTP, Telnet, WWW}

\section*{a) E-Mail (Electronic Mail)}

E-mail or Electronic mail is a paperless method of sending messages, notes or letters from one person to another or even many people at the same time via the Internet. E-mail is very fast compared to the normal post. Easy to manage inexpensive and saves on paper. For one to be able to communicate using e-mail, the following components are needed:
i) A computer to send and receive message
ii) Your e-mail address and that of the receiver
iii) An Internet Service Provider (ISP) company who will deliver the message to the receiver
iv) An e-mail program that lets you send, receive and manage your e-mail messages e.g. Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, Lotus notes, e.t.c.

A typical e-mail message has three basic elements; header, message and signature.
i) The header appears first and typically includes the following information;

To. $\qquad$ line; for person to receive the message (his/her email address)
The $c c$ : ........... line: used by the sender to provide a list of email addresses that must receive a carbon copy of the message. Several addresses can be listed in this headerline, separated by commas. All recipients of the email message receive the To: and $c c$ : header lines.
The $b c c:$.........line: used by the sender to provide a list of comma separated email addresses that must receive a blind carbon copy of the message. The bcc header line is not delivered to the recipients of the email message.
The date.
From $\qquad$ line; the person sending the message
Subject $\qquad$ line; a description of the message
The attachment line; for attachment of files
ii) Message/letter

Its typically short and to the point.
iii) Signature

This line provides additional information about the sender.

\section*{Components of an E-mail Address}

As in the case of normal mail system, e-mail is also based upon the concept of a recipient address. The email address provides all of the information required to get a message to the recipient from anywhere in the world. The internet uses an addressing message called Domain Name System (DNS) to assign names to people and computers. Consider the e-mail ID
benesad@yahoo.com
In the example above, "benesad" is the username, which is the name of a mailbox on the destination computer, where finally the mail will be delivered. @ is a separator. yahoo is the

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
mail server where the mailbox "benesad" exists, .com is the type of organization on net, which is hosting the mail server.
There are six main categories;
com Commercial institutions or organization
edu Educational institutions
gov Government site
mil Military site
net Gateways and administrative hosts
org Private organizations
The address book
E-mails usually have and address book. This is a directory of details, including e-mail addresses, for people whom you send messages (called contacts).

\section*{b) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)}

File Transfer Protocol, is an Internet utility software used to upload and download files. It gives access to directories or folders on remote computers and allows software, data and text files to be transferred between different kinds of computers.

\section*{WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW)}
a) World Wide Web

WWW is the acronym for the World Wide Web. It is also commonly known as 'The Web'. It is a collection of hyperlinked web pages published on the internet. This huge collection of documents is stored on computers called hosts.
b) Web site

A collection of web pages belonging to an organization or an individual. An area on the WWW that is accessed by its own internet address.
c) Web page

Are documents published by organizations and individuals interested in putting themselves on the web. Web pages can include text, pictures, sound and video. Each web page has an address on the internet. This address is called a uniform resource Locator. (URL). A web site can be a collection of web pages.
d) Home page

Is the web page loaded when internet explorer is first started i.e. when you access the web. The home page is also the first page of a company or an individual's websites on the web. The home page of a website is the introductory page for the site.
e) Web browser:

A program that lets you browse through (or surf) information on the web. Information on the web is structured into pages.
The two browsers that are popular are: Microscope Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, Morzila Firefox,
f) Search engine:

A computer program that is used to look for information, find specific websites on the internet. Programs that search documents for specified keywords and returns a list of the documents where the keywords were found on the internet.
g) Web address (Uniform Resource Locator: URL)

It is a unique address or location for each page. The process of using browser to view information on Internet is known as Browsing or Surfing.
h) Internet Address/

Just like every house, every office, every location has an address, every page on the Internet has a unique address. This address is used get the web page for user from Internet.

The address on the Internet is known as URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A typical Internet address or URL would look like;
http://www.nos.org/computers/internet/url.htm.
The URL locates a particular web Page, among all the computers connected to the Internet. The URL contains the components that specify the protocol, server, and pathname of an item. Let us examine the URL given above (http://www.nos.org/computers/internet/url.htm).

The protocol is followed by a colon (http:), the server is preceded by two slashes (//www.nos.org), and each segment of the pathname is preceded by a single slash (/computers/internet/url.htm). A protocol is set of rules that tells the computer know how to interpret the information at that address.
The first component, the protocol, defines the manner for interpreting computer information. Many Internet pages use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other common Internet protocols that one might come across are FTP (File Transfer Protocol), NEWS (Usenet news groups protocol), and GOPHER (an alternative transfer protocol). Gopher protocol is mostly out of date now.

The second component, the server (www.nos.edu) or domain name, identifies the computer system that stores the information you seek and is always preceded by two slashes. A server is a computer that has information stored on it and sends it to the client, when a request is made. Each server on the Internet has a unique address name whose text refers to the organization maintaining the server.

The last component (/computers/internet/), defines the path within the Server where the requested item (url.htm) will be found. Most of the Web pages will have .htm or .html as their secondary or extension name.

\section*{OTHER NETWORKS}

Intranet is a computer network that uses Internet Protocol technology to share information, or computing services within an organization.

An intranet uses network technologies as a tool to facilitate communication between people or work groups to improve the data sharing capability and overall knowledge base of an organization's employees. Sometimes, the term refers only to the organization's internal website, but may be a more extensive part of the organization's information technology infrastructure, and may be composed of multiple local area networks. Any of the well-known Internet protocols may be found in an intranet, such as HTTP (web services), SMTP (e-mail), and FTP (file transfer protocol).
While intranets are generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

In many organizations, intranets are protected from unauthorized external access by means of a network gateway and firewall.

An extranet is a private network that uses Internet technology to securely share part of a organization's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. An extranet can be viewed as part of a company's intranet that is extended to users outside the company.

An extranet requires security and privacy. These can include firewall server management, the issuance and use of digital certificates or similar means of user authentication, encryption of messages, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that tunnel through the public network.

\subsection*{6.0 WORD PROCESSING Next lesson}

Word processing is the art of text manipulation. It involves creating \& producing professional looking documents such as letters, memos, reports, etc.

A Word Processor is a computer program that enables a person to create, save, retrieve, edit, format, and print text based documents.

Explain Features (Characteristics) of a Word processor.
Editing modes: Word processors have two editing modes; Insert mode and Type over mode.
- In Insert mode, every character typed between words, lines or characters is placed at the cursor position. This pushes all the text in front of the cursor away without deleting it.
- In Type over mode, every character typed deletes what was there before and replaces it with new text at the cursor position.

Word wrap: A facility/feature that automatically moves a word or cursor to the beginning of the next line if there is insufficient room at the end of the current line.

Common examples of Word processors: -
* Microsoft Word. * WordStar. * Corel WordPerfect. * Wang writer. * Lotus WordPro.
* WordWrite.

\section*{MICROSOFT WORD}

It is a Word processing program. It helps in creating professional-looking documents that can be printed, e.g., letters, reports, memos, essays, projects, books, etc,. Microsoft Word is one of the components of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office is an integrated software with a number of interrelated programs.

The Insertion point (Cursor) indicates the place where text and graphics will appear when typed or inserted.

\section*{Parts of the Microsoft Word Window.}
$\checkmark$ Rulers: helps the user position text or objects in the right position.
i) Horizontal ruler: Uses of the Horizontal ruler. Setting tab stops. Contain markers for paragraph indentation, e.g., First Line, Left indent \& Hanging indent. Can be used to
adjust the Left and Right page margins. Can be used for adjusting the column widths of a table. Can be used to show column boundaries, and also adjust the size of text columns.
ii) Vertical ruler: The vertical ruler can be used to adjust the Top and Bottom page margins and the Row height in tables.
$\checkmark$ Status bar. That acts as a communication link between the user and the program. It displays information about the current condition of the program, such as saving operation, the name of the file in use, the current page, cursor position, the current section or information about the selected item. The Status bar helps the user to interact with the application because it displays the processing status of the application.

\section*{Creating a Document.}
1. Creating a New Blank Document.
2. Creating documents using Templates.

A Template is a file that contains the standard text, graphics and formatting for use in all documents of the same type. A Template is a document that acts as a blueprint or outline for other documents of the same type. i) Using templates helps to save time \& makes creating of new documents easy. ii) It also ensures that there is consistency between the documents being created.
Viewing Documents. Types of Views:
1. Normal view: Normal view is convenient for most typing, editing and formatting tasks. It shows text formatting and a simplified layout of the page so that you can type and edit quickly.
2. Print Layout View: Displays how a document or other object will appear when printed. It shows how text, graphics, headers, footnotes, columns, textboxes and other elements will be positioned on the printed page. This view is useful for editing headers and footers, for adjusting margins, and for working with columns and drawing objects.
3. Print Preview: A view of a document as it will appear when printed. In this view, you can see page breaks \& watermarks and you can make editing or formatting changes before printing the document.
4. Web layout view: Shows how a document will appear in a Web browser. In Web layout view, the document appears as one long page (without page breaks), while text and tables wrap to fit in the window.
5. Full Screen mode: In this mode, Ms-Word removes distracting screen elements, such as toolbars and scroll bars so that it displays as much of your document as possible on the screen.
Zoom in or out of a document. You can "zoom in" to get a close-up view of your document or
"zoom out" to see more of the page at a reduced size.

\section*{Saving Documents.}
$\checkmark$ Using the 'Save' command: The Save command can be used when you are saving a new document for the first time or when saving changes to an open document.
$\checkmark$ Using the 'Save As...' command: Save As can be used if you want to:
- Name and save a new document or template.
- Save a document or template on a different disk drive or in a different folder.
- Make a copy of an existing document or template with a new name, leaving the original document unchanged.
Protecting a document using a Password.
$\checkmark$ A Password is a combination of characters that prevents other users from opening and changing a document without permission.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{Editing a Document}
$\checkmark$ Editing refers to making any necessary changes to an already existing document.
- Deleting Text. Backspace Key. Delete Key.
- Typing Over Existing Text. Insert Mode. Overtype Mode

\section*{Copying of Text and Objects.}
$\checkmark$ Copying text means making a duplicate of the text or object. Copy Paste. Clip Board:
$\checkmark$ Moving of text means relocating text from one place in a document to another (or changing the position of text or an object in a document).
- Cut Paste. Drag-and-drop
$\checkmark$ In Moving, all the selected text is transferred to a new location, while in Copying, the original text is left intact.
$\checkmark$ The Clipboard is the storage area for items you have cut or copied. Each time you execute Cut or Copy, you replace the old information on the Clipboard with whatever you just cut or copied. You can paste Clipboard information as often as you like, until you replace it with something else.
$\checkmark$ There are three major methods of cutting, copying, and pasting: using the menu, using keyboard shortcuts, and using icons. In most programs, they work exactly as described here.
Finding \& Replacing Text in a Document.
$\checkmark$ The Find and Replace features are used to search for a specific word or phrase that you want to review or edit and automatically replace with other text.
$\checkmark$ When you need to search for a word or phrase in a large document, use the Find command. In case you wish to replace a word or phrase, use the Replace option.

\section*{Understanding Nonprinting Characters}
$\checkmark$ Certain characters, called nonprinting characters, do not print and will not appear in your printed document but do affect your document layout.

\section*{Inserting Symbols \& Special Characters.}
- Symbols
- Equations

\section*{Inserting Date \& Time.}

Proofreading. Refers to checking whether the document has typographical or grammar errors.
Ms-Word provides the following tools for proofreading a prepared document; Spelling and grammar checker, Thesaurus, AutoComplete and AutoCorrect.
Checking Spellings \& Grammar in a Document.
Ms-Word uses wavy red underlines to indicate possible spelling mistakes \& wavy green underlines to indicate possible grammatical mistakes.

Spelling and Grammar dialog box options.
a) Change - accepts the current selection in the Suggestions box. When the selected error is a repeated word, this button changes to Delete so you can easily remove the second instance of the word.
b) Change All - corrects all the occurrences of the misspelled word.
c) If the intended word is not in the Suggestions box, you can correct spelling and grammar directly in the document while the Spelling and Grammar dialog box is still displayed.

Click in the document \& type your correction, and then click Resume to continue checking the spelling and grammar.
d) Ignore Once - Leaves the highlighted error unchanged (if the highlighted word is a valid word) \& finds the next spelling or grammar error. This button changes to resume if you click in the document to make a change in the document.
e) Ignore All - retains all the occurrences of the same word or phrase in the document from another language, e.g., a Kiswahili.
f) Add - Adds the highlighted word in the Suggestions box to the Custom dictionary.
g) Explain - gives a detailed explanation of a grammar flag.
h) Ignore Rule -Leaves all instances of the highlighted error unchanged throughout the document and continues to check the document.
Looking Up For Words Using Thesaurus.
$\checkmark$ Thesaurus is an editing tool that provides the user with a list of synonyms (words that have similar meaning) \& sometimes antonyms (words that have opposite meaning) to the selected word.

\section*{AutoComplete feature.}
$\checkmark$ The AutoComplete feature displays a complete word when the user types the first few characters of the word.
$\checkmark$ This enables the user to type faster/quickly by completing a word that the user has already started typing automatically.
$\checkmark$ To accept the suggested word (if indeed he/she intended to type it), simply press the ENTER key and continue typing other words or phrases.

\section*{AutoCorrect feature}
$\checkmark$ The AutoCorrect feature can be used to automatically detect and correct wrongly spelled words, and replace them with the correct ones as set by the user.
$\checkmark$ E.g. if you type teh plus a space, AutoCorrect replaces it with "the.", or if you type This is theh ouse plus a space, AutoCorrect replaces it with "This is the house."
$\checkmark$ AutoCorrect can also be used to quickly insert symbols that are included in the inbuilt list of AutoCorrect entries. E.g., type (c) to insert ©.
$\checkmark$ AutoCorrect can automatically detect and correct incorrect capitalization. It can also capitalize the first word in a sentence, the names of days of the week, the first letter of text in a table cell, etc.
AutoComplete - helps a person to type quickly by completing a word that the user has already started to be type automatically.
AutoCorrect - automatically replaces mistyped words with the correct ones as set by the user.
Creating an AutoText
- Highlight the text. Choose the Insert tab.
- Click Quick Parts in the Text group. A menu appears.
- Click Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery. The Create New Building Block dialog box appears.
Undo, Redo and Repeat Actions.
Undo is used to reverse changes you make in a document, such as editing, formatting, checking spelling, inserting breaks, footnotes and tables. CTR + Z

\section*{Word Count}

Word Count assists a person to know how many words, pages, paragraphs, lines, no. of characters, are in your document including spaces.

\section*{FORMATTING A DOCUMENT.}

Formatting refers to applying various styles or features to enhance the appearance of a document.
It can also mean making a document attractive or enhancing the appearance of a document by bolding, italicizing, bordering, coloring, etc.

\section*{Text Formatting.}

Text formatting refers to features such as:
- Changing font types \& font style, changing size of characters, changing text color, underlining, bolding, italicizing, text alignment, etc.
- Font Styles (Bold, Italic, Underline), Font effects (Shadow, Subscript, Superscript, small caps), font size, text color, change case.
- A font Type is a set of characters with the same design and shape. Changing Font Size is Making text Larger or Smaller.
- Superscript raises the selected text above the baseline
- Small Caps formats any selected lowercase text as capital letters and reduces their size)
- Format Painter tool copies how text is formatted and lets you apply it elsewhere.
- Bolding text: Bolding makes the selected text appear darker than the rest of the text.
- Underline text: Underlining refers to placing a line at the base or bottom of a word or phrase.
- Italicizing text: To italicize is to make the text slant forward.
- Strikethrough: Cross something out by drawing a line through it
- Change Case: Changes the selected text Title Case, Lower Case, or other case as specified. Sentence Case: - makes the first letter of the first word in the selected sentences a capital. Lowercase: - changes all selected text to small letters. UPPERCASE: - changes all selected text to capital letters. Title Case: - makes the first letter of each word in the selection a capital. tOGGLE cASE: - changes all uppercase letters in the selection to lowercase and vice versa.

\section*{Paragraph Formatting.}
- Align paragraph left, center, right, justified
- Indenting paragraphs: Left, right, first line, hanging. Indentation refers to moving the text away from the margin. Negative indent (also known as an outdent): - pulls the paragraph out towards the left margin.
- Spacing: Line spacing, Spacing Before and after
- Creating Lists: Bullets and Numbering
- Text Alignment refers to how text is positioned (lined up) in a paragraph relative to the left, right, or centre of the page.
- Left alignment; this is the default alignment. Lines of text are lined up evenly along the left margin, but unevenly at the right margin.
- Right alignment; Lines of text are lined up evenly along the right margin, but unevenly at the left margin.
- Center alignment; the lines of text are centered unevenly between the left \& right margins.
- Justification; Lines of text are arranged evenly along the left \& right margin.
- Line spacing sets the amount of space between lines within a paragraph.
- Paragraph space is often used to clearly identify where each paragraph begins and ends.
- Bullet: - A dot or any other symbol placed before text, such as items in a list, in order to add emphasis.

A Drop cap is used to attract the reader's attention by making the first character in a sentence large, taking more space in the next line.
- The Dropped option positions the dropped capital letter in line (flush) with the left margin, inside the main text area.
- The In Margin option positions the dropped capital letter in the left margin.

\section*{Setting tab stops \& Tab spacing.}
- Tabs are used to indent the first line of a paragraph or to create columnar data.
- Tab spacing: - is a short distance moved by the text cursor when the Tab key on the Keyboard is pressed. It is used to align text on the page.
- Tab stop: - is a location on the horizontal ruler that indicates how far a certain text is indented or where to begin a column of text.
- By default, the tab stop is set at 0.5 of an inch.
- Tab leaders - are characters usually dots or hyphens, that fill the space between words separated by tabs. They are intended to draw the reader's eye across a line.
- Tab alignment buttons.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Button & Name & Purpose (explanation for each button) \\
\hline$\llcorner$ & Left tab & Text is left aligned \\
\hline$\perp$ & Centre tab & Text is centered \\
\hline 1 & Bar tab & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Inserts a vertical line at tab stop and align text to \\
the right of the line
\end{tabular} \\
\hline$\lrcorner$ & Right tab & Text is right aligned \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{SECTIONS \& SECTION BREAKS}

A Break is used to identify where a section, a column or a page ends and the beginning of next. This allows the user to apply more than one paragraph or page format in the same document especially when it comes to page layout, size, different margins, etc.

A Section break is a mark that you insert to show the end of a section. Section breaks divide the document into sections, and then each section is formatted as needed.
A Section is a portion of a document in which one can set certain page formatting options.
Types of formatting elements you can set for sections.
* Margins
* Paper size or orientation * Page numbering
* Page borders
* Vertical alignment. * Line numbering.
* Headers and footers.* Columns
* Footnotes and endnotes

\section*{Types of section breaks.}
(i). Continuous - inserts a section break \& starts the new section on the same page.
(ii). Next page - inserts a section break \& starts the new section on the next page.
(iii). Odd page section breaks.

Inserts a section break \& starts the new section on the next odd-numbered page.
(iv). Even page section break.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Inserts a section break \& starts the new section on the next even-numbered page.

\section*{Inserting a section break.}
i) Click in the document where you want the section break to be inserted.
ii)

Note. A section break controls the formatting of the text of the section that precedes it. If you delete a section break, the preceding text becomes part of the following section and assumes its section formatting.

\section*{Delete a section break.}
i) Select the section break you want to delete.

If you're in Print layout view and you do not see the section break, click Show/Hide on the Home tab to display hidden text.
ii) Press the Delete key.

\section*{Page Formatting}
i) Inserting Page Breaks.

A Page break identifies the end of one page and the beginning of the next page. When typing, the text cursor inserts a new page automatically when the current a page is full with text or graphics during typing. Such a page break is referred to an "Automatic" (or Soft) page break. However, if the user wants a page to begin at a particular spot (even before the end of the page), he/she can insert a page break manually. Such a page break is referred to as a "Manual" (or Hard) page break.
Insert a Manual Page Break:
i) Click to position the Insertion point where you want to start a new page.
ii) Press CTRL+ENTER.
-OR-
Choose breaks command on the page layout tab of the ribbon.
To Remove a Manually inserted Page break.
In Normal view, double-click the page break you want to delete, then press Delete.
ii) Creating Newsletter-Style Columns.

You can quickly format text into multiple columns. To create columns on existing text; Method 1.
a) In Print layout view, select the text you want to format in columns. To select an entire document, click Select All on the home tab editing commands.
b) On the Page Layout tab under page setup commands Select Columns. Note. In Normal view, Ms-Word displays one column at a time. In Print Preview or Print Layout view, the columns are displayed side by side (i.e. the text flows from one column to the next on the same page).

\section*{Forcing the start of a new column.}
a) Click where you want to start the new column.
b) Press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. -OR-
c) On the Page Layout tab use Breaks Command under page setup commands Changing the Width of the text columns.

iii) Page setup has options that allow the user to specify the size of the margins, paper size, and layout/appearance of a printed page.

Page margins are the visible blank spaces outside the printing area of a page. They mark the distance that the text starts on a page away from the edge of the page.
Normally, text \& graphics are inserted in the printable area inside the margins. However, items such as headers, footers, and page numbers can be positioned in the margins.

\section*{Importance of setting page margins.}
- Adjusting Page margins provides additional space for binding, punching or stapling.
- Setting the margins helps when printing a document on pre-printed stationery such as a Letterhead. It ensures that, your text does not overwrite the pre-printed parts of the stationery.
E.g., to print on a Letterhead, change the top margin so that it is slightly larger than the pre-printed part of the letterhead.
To set margins for a page;

\section*{CREATING MS-WORD TABLES.}

A Table is a feature in Ms-Word made up of rows \& columns which intersect to form cells that the user can enter text and graphics.
- A Cell is a box formed by the intersection of a row \& column in a worksheet or a table, in which the user can enter information.
- A Row is a horizontal arrangement of cells; a Column is a vertical arrangement of cells.

\section*{Importance of creating tables.}
- Tables are used to organize and enhance the display of information such as timetables.
- Tables make it easier to read \& understand information that would otherwise have to be written in a repetitive and lengthy fashion.

Note. To perform calculations in a table, the table cells must be referenced as A1, A2, B1, B2, etc, with the letter representing the column \& the number representing a row.

\section*{Methods of creating a new table.}

After creating the table, click in a cell and start typing text.
$\sim$ To move the text cursor from one cell to the next in the same row, press the TAB key.
$\sim$ To move text cursor one column to the left in the same row (to move to the previous cell), press SHIFT + TAB.

\section*{MAIL MERGING}

Mail merging is the process of generating personalized letters or documents by combining a standard document, e.g., a letter, with a list of addresses, and producing several copies of the standard document, but addressed to different recipients.

The standard document (letter) is referred to as the 'Main Document' and the list of addresses is referred to as the 'Data Source'.

\section*{Importance of mail merging.}
- Mail merge enables the user to send out the same document to several recipients at once.
- Combining of letters saves time when printing.
- The mailing list used in a Mail merge can be re-used on another document (unlike Copy \& Pasting).

\section*{The Mail merge process.}

The Mail merge process consists of 4 main steps:
1. Create the Main document or Open an existing Main document.

Main document is the common document or letter that is to be sent to all the people on the mailing list. It is sometimes known as the Form letter.

The Main document contains the text \& graphics that are the same for each version of the merged document, e.g., the return address or salutation.
2. Create the Data source or Open an existing Data source, with individual recipient information.

Data source (or Addresses file) is a file of data records of the people that will receive the form letter.
The Data source contains the information or data that varies in each copy of a merged document. E.g., the list of names \& addresses you want to use in a mail merge.
3. Add Merge fields in the main document.

Merge field is a placeholder that you insert in the main document. It helps Ms-Word insert the name or information that is stored in a particular data field.
4. Merge or combine data from the Data source with the Main document to create a new, merged document.
Therefore, in a mail merge, there are three files created:
1. The primary file (Main document).
2. The secondary file (Data source).
3. Merged file.

\section*{GRAPHICS \& DIAGRAMS IN MICROSOFT WORD}

The term Graphics refers to non-text images or objects generated by a computer. They include; photographs, pictures, drawings, and graphs.

\section*{Importance.}
- Information presented graphically is easy to understand, e.g., if you have a lot of information, representing it graphically is more effective than using text only.
- Graphics \& drawings can be used to enhance Ms-Word documents, e.g., one can use arrows to draw attention to certain data.
- A well-placed picture can help illustrate a point clearly, and can transform a plain looking document into an interesting document.
Types of Graphics.
There are 3 basic types of graphics that you can use to enhance your Ms-Word documents:

\section*{1. Drawing objects}
2. Pictures
3. Charts

\section*{Drawing objects.}

A Drawing object is any graphic that is drawn or inserted into a document, and can be changed or improved.

Drawing objects include AutoShapes and WordArt.
AutoShapes is a group of ready-made graphic images or shapes. AutoShapes usually have predefined shapes, and the user can draw by selecting it, then dragging its size on the screen. Examples of AutoShapes are; rectangles, circles, Lines, Connectors, Block arrows, Flowchart symbols, Stars, etc.

\section*{Pictures.}

A Picture is a graphic that was created from another file. They include Photographs, Scanned pictures, Bitmaps, and ClipArt.
A Bitmap is a picture made from a series of small dots. When stored as files, bitmaps usually have the extension ".bmp".

\section*{Chart.}

A Chart is a graphical presentation of data in a table. Charts are used to summarize data in a document in a pictorial way.

\section*{Sources of graphics that can be used in Ms-Word.}

There are 4 sources of graphics that can be used in Ms-Word. You can insert a graphical object;
1. From the Microsoft Clip gallery.
2. From a Scanner.
3. By using the Drawing tools available in Ms-Word.
4. Import from file.

\section*{DRAWING OF OBJECTS (AUTOSHAPES) IN MS-WORD}

\section*{Deleting a drawing object, Text Box or WordArt.}

\section*{Inserting Smart Art}

\section*{Positioning Objects}

Whenever a graphic is inserted into a document, it is inserted in line with text by default. This means that the text in the document moves in order to accommodate the graphic.

\section*{Text Wrapping}

To adjust how text reacts to the objects in your document:
- In line with text: This places the object at the insertion point in a line of text in the document. The object remains in the same layer at the text. This is the default setting.
- Square: Wraps text around all sides of the square bounding box for the selected object
- Tight: Wraps text tightly around the edges of the actual image
- Through: wraps text throughout the image
- Top and bottom: wraps text around the top and bottom of the object, leaving the area to the right and left of the object clear.
- Behind text: This removes text wrapping and puts the object behind text in the document. The object floats on its own layer
- In front of text: this removes text wrapping and places the object in front of the text in document. The object floats on its own layer.

\section*{Grouping Objects}

It is often easier to work with a single object than it is to work with several objects. A group is a collection of objects the word treats as a single object. Select Multiple objects. Click format tab on the ribbon and click the group button in the arrange group. Ungroup

\section*{Layering Objects}

How can you make sure one object on a page appears in front or in back of a nother? Word solves this by layering like a stack of paper:
- Bring to Front:
- Send to Back
- Bring Forward
- Send Backward

\section*{Importing objects into a word processor.}

Importing refers to getting ready-made objects and text from other applications into a word processor.

\section*{Difference between Object Linking and Embedding.}

In Linking, the object imported can only be edited in the original application from which it was created;
In Embedding, the object imported becomes part of the current application, and can be edited there.

\section*{PRINTING A DOCUMENT}

Previewing a document (Display each page as it will look when printed).
Before you print a document, it is important to make sure that it will be printed the way you want it.
Previewing a document enables you to see exactly the way the pages will appear when printed, and where necessary, make any changes to the document.

\section*{Advantages of previewing a document before printing.}
- To confirm that no details are outside the printable area, and that the page layout is okay.
- To go through the document before printing.
- To save printing papers \& printer toner because; errors on printouts that may require reprints will be minimal.

\section*{GETTING HELP AS YOU WORK IN MS-WORD}

\section*{Purpose of the Help facility.}
$\checkmark$ To get a step-by-step guide on how to perform tasks.
$\checkmark$ To get access to more information about features in Ms-Word while you are working.
To get help Press F1 and type a keyword describing the nature of help.
Styles. A style is a group of format settings stored under a single name. Styles are sets of formats that are designed to work together to create attractive and professional looking documents. Styles are a set of formats you can quickly apply to a paragraph. For example, by applying a style, you can set the font, set the font size, and align a paragraph all at once.

Table of contents: TOC is a list of topics in a document and the pages they appear. When you apply styles throughout your document, Word will automatically create a TOC based on your headers. You create a table of contents by applying heading styles - for example, Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3 - to the text that you want to include in the table of contents. Microsoft Word searches for those headings and then inserts the table of contents into your document. When you create a table of contents this way, you can automatically update it if you make changes in your document.

\subsection*{7.0 SPREADSHEETS}

A Spreadsheet is a computer program that looks like the manual ledger sheet with rows \& columns for entering data that can be manipulated mathematically using formulas.
Examples of the commonly used Spreadsheet programs
- VisiCalc, Lotus 123, Microsoft Excel, Corel Quattro-Pro

\section*{A spreadsheet has 3 main components, namely;}
(a). Workbook.
(b). Database.
(c). Graphs / Charts.

\section*{Workbook:}

When working in any spreadsheet program, you use workbook files to hold your information.
* A Workbook is a file that contains one or more worksheets. A worksheet is a grid of rows \& columns in which you work and store your data.
A Workbook allows the user to organize various kinds of related information in a single file.

\section*{Database:}

Spreadsheet programs such as Excel have special features, which can be used to manage data values entered in the cells of the spreadsheet.

These features, which are found on the Data tab, were incorporated in Excel but they belong to Database Management System software.

Examples of such features include: Filtering of records, use of Forms, calculating of Subtotals, data validation, Pivot tables and Pivot chart reports.

\section*{Example:}

If related data values are entered on the same row, they form a Record. Hence, a worksheet can be manipulated as a database that has data records entered in it.

\section*{Graphs/Charts:}

A Chart is a graphical/pictorial representation of data in a worksheet. Charts are used to summarize data in a worksheet in a pictorial form.
They enable the users to present complex data elements from a worksheet in a simple format that they can understand.
Charts make it easy for users to see comparisons, patterns, and trends in data, e.g., instead of having to analyse several columns of a worksheet, one can see at a glance whether sales are falling or rising.
Examples of charts are: Pie charts, Line graphs, Bar charts, Histograms, Column charts, etc.

\section*{Application areas of spreadsheets (Areas where Spreadsheets are used)}

Accounting: Spreadsheets provide an easy \& streamlined means of financial management. They are mostly used by Accountants to record their daily transactions \& also keep financial records.
For example; a spreadsheet can be used to do the following: Record sales \& purchases, Calculate profits, Prepare budgets, Produce Invoices, and also compile financial statements.
2. Data management: A spreadsheet enables information to be produced easily and kept up-to-date. For example;
- It enables the user to create, edit, save, retrieve and print worksheet data \& records.
- It enables data to be arranged neatly in tabular structure.
- Related data can be typed on the same worksheet. If the data is on different worksheets, the worksheets can be linked so that the data can be accessed easily.
Some of the data management functions include: Sorting (i.e., arranging worksheet records in a particular order so as to easily access the data items), Filtering (i.e., displaying only the records that meet a given condition), Use of Forms to enter \& view records, Use of Total/Subtotal function.
3. Scientific Applications: Spreadsheet programs can be used by Scientists \& Researchers to compile \& analyse their results.
4. Statistical analysis / Mathematical operations: Spreadsheets provide a set of data analysis tools that can be used to develop complex statistical analyses. In addition, some of the tools generate charts. Examples of statistical functions include: AVERAGE - used to calculate the mean of a set of values, MEDIAN - used to give the value in the middle of a set of values.
5. Forecasting (What if analysis): The automatic recalculation feature makes it possible to use the "What if" analysis technique. What if analysis is a feature in a spreadsheet that is used to find out the effect of changing certain values in a worksheet on other cells. It involves changing the value of one of the arguments in a formula in order to see the difference the change would make on the result of the calculation. This method can be used for financial forecasting, budgeting, cost analysis, etc.

\section*{Common features of Electronic spreadsheets.}
1. Have the ability to create, edit, save \& retrieve worksheets.
2. Have inbuilt functions \& formulae which can be used to perform calculations.
3. Allows Automatic recalculation, i.e., when you change one value, the rest of the values in the spreadsheet are automatically recalculated by the computer to correspond with the different input. This enables you to play "what if" games with your system.
4. Have the ability to Sort and filter data (i.e., arrange data in a predefined order).

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
5. Have a Data validation facility, which ensures that the correct data is entered into the Spreadsheet.
6. Have a Chart facility that can be used to draw line graphs, Bar charts, histograms, etc.
7. Have the ability to format data (both text \& numeric data) using predefined formats.
8. Have the ability to adjust Column widths \& Row heights automatically.
9. Have the ability to hide and unhide rows \& columns, and also freeze panes.
10. They enable printing of worksheets within the shortest time possible.
11. They have pre-designed Templates for automating tasks.

A Template is a document that acts as a blueprint or outline for other documents of the same type.
12. Have the ability to summarize data using Consolidation and Pivot tables.

Consolidation allows the merging of several worksheets into a summary sheet, while still keeping the original worksheets intact. Consolidation adds together cells with the same co-ordinates in the various worksheets. Pivot tables can be used to cross-tabulate large amounts of data.

\section*{MICROSOFT EXCEL}

This is a Spreadsheet program that enables users to create electronic worksheets that can be used to perform simple \& complex calculations using a computer.

Ms-Excel has inbuilt functions that are used as shortcuts for performing mathematical, financial and statistical calculations.

\section*{WORKSHEET LAYOUT (Features/ Parts/ Elements of the Ms-Excel Screen).}

\section*{(a). Ribbon:}
- Name box - displays the active cell, e.g., A1.

\section*{THE WORKSHEET:}

A Worksheet consists of cells that are organized into columns \& rows in which data entries are made.
Cell:
* A box formed when a row \& a column intersect in a worksheet or a table; where the data is entered.
A cell is referred to or identified by use of the column letter heading \& the row number heading (e.g., A1 refers to the first cell).

Columns: A...... IV . press $<$ End key $>$ then left arrow key, <ctr> + <home> Rows: 1 ........ 65536 . <end> then down arrow key. <Scroll Lock> <page up>

\section*{MANAGING WORKSHEETS \& WORKBOOKS.}

Formulas can perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

\section*{(4).Functions.}
* It is an inbuilt equation that is used for calculations.
* A Function is a predefined (inbuilt) formula used to perform a given specific task. Functions can be used to perform both simple and complex calculations.

\section*{ENTERING DATA IN WORKSHEET CELLS.}

\section*{Entering numbers or text.}
1. Click the cell where you want to enter data. The Cell pointer moves to that cell. Type.

\section*{Entering fractions \& negative numbers.}
- To avoid entering a fraction as a date, type a zero (0) before the fraction. E.g. type $\mathbf{0} \frac{1 / 2}{2}$
- To enter a negative number, precede it with a minus sign ( - ), or enclose the numbers in parenthesis ().

Note. Usually, numbers are Right-aligned in a cell, while text is left-aligned in the cell.

\section*{Entering a date, or a time.}
1. Click the cell where you want to enter the date or time.
- Type the date, separating its parts with a forward slash or a hyphen (dash).
E.g. 9/5/2002 or 5-Sep-2002. To enter today's date, press CTRL+; (semicolon).
- To enter a time based on the 12 -hour clock, type a space followed by AM or $\mathbf{P M}$. Otherwise, Ms-Excel enters the time as AM. E.g., if you type 3:00 instead of 3:00 PM, the time is stored as 3:00AM. To enter the current time, press CTRL+SHIFT+: (colon).
Note.
- To type a date and time in the same cell, separate the date and time with a space.
- Excel treats dates \& times as numbers, and are therefore Right-aligned in a cell.

Method 2. Using the TODAY Function. Type "=TODAY()" in the cell, then press ENTER.

\section*{EDITING CELL CONTENTS.}

Double-click on the cell that contains the data you want to edit.
-Or-
Click in the cell, then press F2.

Deleting cells, rows, or columns

Deleting removes the cells from the worksheet and shifts the surrounding cells to fill the space.

\section*{CHANGING THE COLUMN WIDTH.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Sometimes, your data may not fit within the standard column width. This happens especially when you are working with long labels, large font sizes, or with data that has been formatted as currency.
- Point to the right border of the column heading. When the pointer changes to a cross (a two-headed arrow), drag the boundary of the column heading until the column is the width you want. Or,
- Double-click the boundary to the right of the column heading. This will adjust the column width to fit the widest data in the column. This is known as the 'Best Fit' method.
To do the same for multiple columns; select the columns, then double-click a boundary to the right of one of the column headings.
-OR-
Select AutoFit Selection on the Format menu under cells group on the Home Tab. Or,
- Select the column, on the Format menu under cells group of commands onth home tab, select Column Width, then enter a number.

\section*{To shrink the font size to show all data in a cell.}

If a small amount of data isn't visible in a cell, you can reduce the font size of the data instead of resizing the column.
1. Select the cells you want to format.
2. On the Home tab, under cells group of commands, click Format then Format Cells, then click the Alignment tab.
3. Select the Shrink to fit checkbox.

\section*{CHANGING ROW HEIGHT.}

\section*{POSITIONING (ALIGNING) DATA IN A CELL.}
- Adjusting the alignment of the cell contents, helps to distinguish different types of information in cells. Usually when you enter text data into a worksheet, it is normally aligned to the left in a cell, while numbers, dates \& times are aligned to the right.

\section*{Merging cells across columns.}

You can easily merge headings across the top of a range of cells. When you merge cells, the selected cells are combined into one cell. This spreads the content of one cell over many cells.
- To merge cells in a row or column and center the cell contents, click the Merge and Center button on the Home tab, under alignment group of commands.
- Merged cell - A single cell that is created by combining two or more selected cells. The cell reference for a merged cell is the upper left cell in the original selected range.

\section*{To rotate text in a cell.}

You can rotate cell contents as much as 90 degrees up or down.
1. In the Orientation box, click an angle (in degrees) like 45,60 or 90 , or drag the indicator to the angle you want.
To display text vertically from top to bottom, click the vertical Text Box under Orientation.

2. On the Format menu, click Cells, then click the Number tab.
3. In the Category list, click General.

\section*{FINDING RECORDS.}
- Suppose you wanted to view records that meet given conditions, you would have to sort the table according to the conditions so as to find out where those records appear in the list. Such conditions are referred to as 'Criteria'.
- However, this method will require you to sort the table whenever you want to find something different.
- Ms-Excel offers an easier solution to this through the Filter command on the Data menu.
1. Click on any cell in the table that contains the records you want to search for.
2. On the Data menu, choose Filter, then select AutoFilter from the submenu.

A downward arrow appears on the right of each field name.
3. Click the down arrow on a column to display the conditions that can be set. Select a condition (Criteria) from that list.
Note. If the criteria you want is not in the list or if you want to enter two conditions, then perform the following steps:
(i). Select the column / field to search by clicking on the down arrow to the right of the field name.
The Custom AutoFilter dialog box appears.
(ii). In the Show rows where: box, select the conditions to use by clicking on the down arrow. The list includes 'is greater than'; 'is less than', etc.
(iii). Enter the Value to compare the contents of the field width. You could type or select it from a drop down list of values available in the database.
4. Click the OK button to complete the task.

Note. To redisplay the records, click on the down arrow to the right of the field name that you had selected, and select the option All.

\section*{Example:}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|r|}

\section*{PIVOT TABLES.}

\section*{Purpose.}
- A Pivot table helps us to summarize and analyze large amounts of existing data, from a list or table, using the format and calculation methods of your choice.
1. Select the table or cells (including column headers) you want to include in your PivotTable.
2. From the Insert tab, click the PivotTable command
3. The Create PivotTable dialog box will appear. Choose your settings, then click OK. In our example, we'll use data below as our source data and place the PivotTable on a new worksheet.
(Supposing we want to know the amount sold by each sales person)
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Salesperson & Region & Account & Order Amount & Month \\
\hline Albertson, Kathy & East & 29386 & $\$ 925.00$ & January \\
\hline Albertson, Kathy & East & 74830 & $\$ 875.00$ & February \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
4. A blank PivotTable and Field List will appear on a new worksheet.
5. Once you create a PivotTable, you'll need to decide which fields to add. Each field is simply a column header from the source data. In the PivotTable Field List, check the box for each field you want to add. In our example, we want to know the total amount sold by each salesperson, so we'll check the Salesperson and Order Amount fields.
6. The selected fields will be added to one of the four areas below. In our example, the Salesperson field has been added to the Rows area, while Order Amount has been added to Values. Alternatively, you can drag and drop fields directly into the desired area.

\section*{Autofill}
- The Excel Autofill feature can be used to populate a range of cells with either a repeat value, a series of values, or just a cell format.
To use the simple Excel Autofill:
1. Enter a value into the start cell;
2. Use the mouse to drag the 'fill handle' (the small black square at the bottom right of the start cell) across the range of cells to be filled;
3. When you drag the 'fill handle' across the range of cells to be filled, Excel will fill the selected cells, by either repeating the value in the first cell or by inserting a sequence from the first cell value (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...);
4. Click on the 'Auto Fill Options' box, which will appear at the end of your selected range of cells. This will give you the following different options:
- Copy Cells - copy the initial cell across the selected range;
- Fill Series - fill the selected range with a series of values (typically incrementing by 1 ), starting with the initial cell value;
- Fill Formatting Only - fill the selected range with the formatting, but not the values of the initial cell;
- Fill Without Formatting - fill the selected range with values, but do not copy the formatting from the initial cell.

\section*{PERFORMING CALCULATIONS IN MS-EXCEL. \\ FORMULAS.}

Formula is an expression that calculates the value of a cell. For example, $=\mathrm{A} 2+\mathrm{A} 2+\mathrm{A} 3+\mathrm{A} 4$ is a formula that adds up the values in cells A2 to A4.

\section*{Creating MS-excel formulas.}

Purpose: To perform a calculation in Ms-Excel, you use a formula.
Before you write your formula in Ms-Excel, it is advisable to do the following;
(i). Decide what you want to be calculated, e.g., the Total Cost of items.
(ii). Note down the values in the worksheet required for the calculation and use them to write down the formula, e.g. Quantity * Price.
(iii). Substitute the values with their cell references, e.g. B3*D3.

\section*{Calculation operators in formulas.}

Operator - A sign or a symbol that specifies the type of calculation to perform on the elements of a formula.
Excel includes 4 different types of calculation operators:
(i). Arithmetic (Mathematical) operators.
(ii). Logical (Comparison) Logical operators.
(iii). Reference operators.
(iv). Text concatenation operators.

\section*{Arithmetic (Mathematical) operators.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Arithmetic operator & Meaning & Example \\
\hline + (Plus sign) & Addition & $3+3$ \\
\hline - (Minus sign) & Subtraction & $3-1$ \\
\hline * (Asterisk) & Multiplication & $3 * 3$ \\
\hline /(Forward slash) & Division & $3 / 3$ \\
\hline \% (Percent sign) & Percent & $20 \%$ \\
\hline ^(Exponential) & Exponent & $2^{\wedge} 6$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Logical (Comparison) operators.}

Compares two values and produces a logical value, either TRUE or FALSE.
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|}
\hline Comparison & Meaning & Example. \\
\hline$=$ (equal sign) & Equal to & $\mathrm{A} 1=\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline$>$ (greater than sign) & Greater than & $\mathrm{A} 1>\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline$<$ (less than sign) & Less than & $\mathrm{A} 1<\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline$>=$ (greater than or equal to sign) & Greater than or equal to & $\mathrm{A} 1>=\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline$<=$ (less than or equal to sign) & Less than or equal to & $\mathrm{A} 1<=\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline$<>$ (not equal to sign) & Not equal to & $\mathrm{A} 1<>\mathrm{B} 1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Reference operators.}

Combine ranges of cells for calculations.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Reference operator & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Meaning \\
Range operator; produces one reference \\
to all the cells between two references, \\
including the two references.
\end{tabular} & B5:B9
\end{tabular}

\section*{Text concatenation operators.}

Use the ampersand $(\boldsymbol{\&})$ to join one or more strings to produce a single piece of text.

\section*{Creating a simple formula.}

A Formula in Ms-Excel always begins with an equal (=) sign.
The equal sign tells Ms-Excel that the characters that follow constitute a formula.
Following the equal sign are the elements to be calculated called Operands or Arguments. The Arguments are separated by calculation operators, and enclosed by an opening \& closing parentheses (brackets).

\section*{CELL REFERENCES (Cell Addresses).}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
* A Cell reference is the identity of a cell in a worksheet.
* A Reference identifies a cell or a range of cells on a worksheet and tells Ms-Excel where to look for the values or data you want to use in a formula.

\section*{Examples of Cell references.}
(i). Single cell reference.
(ii). Mixed cell reference.
(iii). Label cell reference.
(iv). Relative cell reference.
(v). Absolute cell reference.

\section*{REFERENCING OF CELLS.}

A cell is identified by use of the Column letter heading \& the Row number heading. For example, B2 refers to the cell at the intersection of column B \& row 2.

There are actually two different types of Excel cell reference, which behave differently when moved into different spreadsheet cells. They are;

\section*{Relative References}

When copied across multiple cells, they change based on the relative position of rows and columns. For example, if you copy the formula $=\mathbf{A 1}+\mathbf{A} \mathbf{2}$ from cell $\mathbf{A 3} 1$ to $\mathbf{B 3}$, the formula will become $=\mathbf{B 1} \mathbf{+ B 2}$. Relative references are especially convenient whenever you need to repeat the same calculation across multiple rows or columns.

\section*{Absolute references}

There may be times when you do not want a cell reference to change when filling cells. Unlike relative references, absolute references do not change when copied or filled. You can use an absolute reference to keep a row and/or column constant.
An absolute reference is designated in a formula by the addition of a dollar sign (\$). Or by pressing the F4 key
An absolute cell reference is a cell reference in a spreadsheet application that remains constant even if the shape or size of the spreadsheet is changed, or the reference is copied or moved to another cell or sheet. Absolute cell references are important when referring to constant values in a spreadsheet.
In short, what makes the relative cell reference different than an absolute cell reference is that copying or moving the formula to different cells causes them to change. Absolute cells always point to the exact row or column described, regardless of where the reference appears.

\section*{USING WORKSHEET FUNCTIONS.}
- Function is a predefined formula already available in Excel. Functions perform specific calculations in a particular order based on the specified values, called arguments, or parameters
- It is an inbuilt equation that is used for calculation.

A function performs operations or calculations using specific values, called arguments. The arguments can be either cell references or values or both.

\section*{Categories of Functions in Ms-Excel.}

Functions are grouped into broad categories by some common features particular to the function.

\section*{1. Financial functions.}

Analyze investments and securities; determine depreciation, calculate cash flows and loans, e.g. the PMT function.

\section*{2. Date \& Time functions.}

Calculate values that represent dates and times.
E.g., the TODAY function is used to return the current date according to the computer's internal clock.

\section*{3. Math \& Trigonometry functions.}

Can be used to perform simple mathematical operations, such as calculating Square roots (SQRT), rounding a number (ROUND), calculating the total value for a range of cells (SUM), etc.
They are also used to replace complex trigonometric calculations like Sine (SIN), Cosine (COS), etc.
E.g., ABS - gives the Absolute value of a number. The Absolute value of a number is the number without its sign.
Syntax: ABS(number)

\section*{4. Statistical functions.}

Perform calculations (statistical analysis) on ranges of data.
E.g., AVERAGE - calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of a set of values in a range.

STDEV - Estimates Standard Deviation based on a sample. Standard Deviation is a measure of how widely values are dispersed from the Average value (Mean).
Syntax: STDEV(number1,number2,....)

\section*{5. Logical functions.}

Calculate the results of logical formulas. E.g., the IF Function.

\section*{6. Look up \& Reference functions.}

Finds or refers to the contents of a cell. For example, the VLOOKUP function.

\section*{7. Database functions.}

Perform statistical calculations and queries on database tables. For instance, DSUM will find the total of values in a particular field (column).

\section*{8. Information functions.}

Return information about cells, ranges, the operating system, and some Ms-Excel tools, or to mark places where information is missing or incorrect.
E.g., CELL - returns information about the formatting, location or contents of a cell.

\section*{Creating a formula that contains a function.}

Note. The structure of a function;
Begins with an Equal sign (=),
Followed by the Function name, \& the Arguments for the function. The Arguments are separated by commas or a colon, and enclosed in an opening \& closing parenthesis.

\section*{EXAMPLE OF FUNCTIONS}
1. PRODUCT multiplies all the nos. given as arguments and returns the product.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{Syntax: PRODUCT(number1,number2,.....)}

Number1, number2,... are the numbers you want to multiply.
Example: Using the values shown in the worksheet below, calculate the cost of the milk.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|c|c|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } & C & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ D } \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Item & Quantity & Price & Total cost \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & Milk & 26 Litres & 15.00 & \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & Sugar & 19 Kgs & 48.90 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
2. Getting the Square Root of a Number.

Use The SQRT function. SQRT gives a positive square root of a specific number.
Syntax: =SQRT(number)
3. Raising a Number to a Power.

Use the POWER function. POWER gives the result of a no. raised to a power.
Syntax: POWER(number, power) Number - is the base no. It can be any real number. Power - is the exponent to which the base no. is raised.

Note. The up carat ( $\wedge$ ) operator can be used instead of POWER to indicate to what power the base no. is to be raised.

\section*{4. The PMT Function}

PMT calculates the payment on a loan (principal) at a given interest rate for a specified no. of payment periods (term).
Syntax: =PMT(Principal-Amount, Interest-Rate, Term)
Principal and Terms are values. Interest is a decimal or percentage value greater than -1 .

\section*{Example;}

A businessman took out a Ksh. 800,000 loan for 4 years at an annual Interest Rate of $26 \%$, compounded monthly. If the monthly installments are paid on the last day of each month, determine the installment to be paid.
$=\operatorname{PMT}(800000,0.26 / 12,48)$
The Monthly installment is $26,973.85$
Note. The Interest is divided by 12 in order to get the monthly rate, and term (in years) is multiplied by 12 to convert it into months.

\section*{5. The FV Function}

FV calculates the future value of a fixed investment earning a fixed interest over a specified period.
E.g., let's say, you want to plan for your retirement in 20 years and decide to invest Ksh. 20,000 each year. If the investment pays $20 \%$ interest compounded annually, the formula would be:
$=\mathbf{F V}(20 \%, 20,-20000)$
You would collect Ksh. 3,733,760 after 20 years.

\section*{6. Rounding of Numbers.}

The ROUND function rounds a given number to a specified no. of digits.

\section*{Syntax: ROUND(number,num_digits)}

Number -is the no. you want to round.
num_digits - specifies the no. of digits to which you want to round the no.
Notes.
- If num_digits is greater than 0 (zero), then number is rounded to the specified no. of decimal places.
- If num_digits is 0 (zero), the number is rounded to the nearest Integer (whole no.).

\section*{Example 1:}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|} 
Formula & Result \\
\hline =ROUND(2.15,1) & 2.2 \\
=ROUND(2.149,1) & 2.1
\end{tabular}
7. Getting the Logarithm of a Number.
$\underline{\mathbf{L O G}}$ - Gives the logarithm of a number to the base you specify.
Syntax: LOG(number,base)
Number -is the positive real no. for which you want the logarithm.
Base -is the base of the logarithm. If base is omitted, it is assumed to be 10 .
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Formula & Result \\
\hline$=\operatorname{LOG}(10)$ & 1 \\
\hline$=\operatorname{LOG}(8,2)$ & 3 \\
\hline$=\operatorname{LOG}(86,2.7182818)$ & 4.454347 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
8. MOD - Gives the remainder after a number is divided by a divisor.

Usually, the result has the same sign as the divisor.
Syntax: MOD(number,divisor)
Number -is the number for which you want to find the remainder.
If divisor is 0, MOD returns the \#DIV/0! error value.
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|} 
Description & Formula & Result \\
\hline Remainder of $3 / 2$ & $=\operatorname{MOD}(3,2)$ & 1 \\
\hline Remainder of $-3 / 2$ & $=\operatorname{MOD}(-3,2)$ & 1 \\

\hline Remainder of $-3 /-2$ & $=\operatorname{MOD}(-3,-2)$ & -1
\end{tabular}
9. COS - Gives the cosine of the given angle.

\section*{Syntax: COS(number)}

Number - is the angle in radians for which you want the cosine. If the angle is in degrees, multiply it by PI()$/ 180$ to convert it to radians.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\hline Integer part of -8.9 & $=$ TRUNC(-8.9) & -8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
13. CALCULATING THE AVERAGE (ARITHMETIC MEAN) OF NUMBERS. Use the AVERAGE function. AVERAGE gives the average (arithmetic mean) of the arguments provided. Syntax: AVERAGE(number1,number2,...)

Number1, number2, ... are numeric arguments for which you want the average.
Note. The arguments must numbers or references that contain numbers. If a reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.
Example: Cells A2:A6 contain values 10, 7, 9, 27, \& 4 .
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Description & Formula & Result \\
\hline Average all of nos. in the list & =AVERAGE(A2:A6) & 11.4 \\
\hline Average cells A2 to A4 and A6 & =AVERAGE(A2:A4,A6) & 7.5 \\
\hline Average the nos. in cell A2 to A5, and 5 & =AVERAGE(A2:A5, 5) & 11.6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{14. CALCULATE THE SMALLEST OR LARGEST NUMBER IN A RANGE.}

Use the MIN or MAX functions.
MAX- Gives the largest value in a set of values.
MIN - Gives the smallest number in a set of values.
Syntax: MAX or MIN(number1, number2,...)
Number1, number2, .. are nos. for which you want to find the maximum or minimum value.
Notes. If the arguments in the reference contain no numbers, MAX or MIN returns 0 (zero). Empty cells, logical values, or text in the reference are ignored.

Example: Cells A2:A6 contain values 10, 7, 9, $27 \& 2$.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Description & Formula & Result \\
\hline Largest number in the range & =MAX(A2:A6) & 27 \\
\hline Smallest number in the range & =MIN(A2:A6) & 2 \\
\hline Largest of the numbers in cells A2:A6, and 30 & =MAX(A2:A6, 30) & \\
\hline Smallest of the numbers given, and 0 & =MIN(A2:A6,0) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{15. CALCULATE THE MEDIAN OF A GROUP OF NUMBERS.}

Median is the value at the center of an ordered range of nos.
Use the MEDIAN function. MEDIAN gives the number in the middle of a set of numbers.
Syntax: MEDIAN(number1, number2,...)
Number1, number2, ... are numbers for which you want the median.
Notes.
- Cells with the value zero are included.
- If there is an even number of nos. in the set, then MEDIAN calculates the average of the two numbers in the middle.
Example: Cells A2:A7 contain values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 . $=$ MEDIAN(A2:A6)
16. MODE - Gives the most frequently occurring, or repetitive, value in a range of data. Syntax: MODE(number1,number2,...)
Number1, number2, ... are the arguments for which you want to calculate the mode.
Note.
- Cells with the value zero are included.
- If the data set contains no duplicate data points, MODE returns the \#N/A error value.

Example: Cells A2:A7 contain the values 5.6, 4, 4, 3, 2, and 4. $=\operatorname{MODE}(\mathrm{A} 2: \mathrm{A} 7)$
Tip. In a set of values, the Mode is the most frequently occurring value; the Median is the middle value; and the Mean is the average value.

\section*{17. COUNTING CELLS THAT CONTAIN NUMBERS.}

COUNT - Counts the no. of cells that contain numbers within the list of arguments.
Syntax: COUNT(value1,value2,...)
Value1, value2, ... are the arguments that can contain or refer to a variety of different types of data, but only numbers are counted.
Note. Empty cells, logical values, text, or error values in the reference are ignored.

\section*{LOGICAL FUNCTIONS}

Logical functions can be used either to test whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE or to check for multiple conditions.
For example, use the IF function to determine whether a condition is true or false. One value is returned if the condition is TRUE, and a different value is returned if the condition is FALSE.
18. NOT -Reverses the value of its argument. Use NOT when you want to make sure a value is not equal to one particular value.
If logical is FALSE, NOT returns TRUE; if logical is TRUE, NOT returns FALSE.
19. $\underline{\mathbf{A N D}}$ - Returns TRUE if all its arguments are TRUE; returns FALSE if one or more argument is FALSE.
Syntax: AND(logical1,logical2, ...)

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Logical1, logical2, .. are the conditions you want to test that can be either TRUE or FALSE.
20. OR - Returns TRUE if any argument is TRUE; returns FALSE if all arguments are FALSE.

\section*{Example:}

Cells A2, A3 \& A4 contain the values 15,9 , and 8 .
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
\hline$=A N D(A 2>A 3$, A2<A4) & Is 15 greater than 9 and less than 8? & FALSE \\
\hline$=O R(A 2>A 3$, A2<A4) & Is 15 greater than 9 or less than $8 ?$ & TRUE \\
\hline$=$ NOT(A2+A3=24) & Is 15 plus 9 not equal to $24 ?$ & FALSE
\end{tabular}
21. THE "IF" function.

Format: IF(Condition, value if true, value if false)

\section*{Example 1.}

Cell A2 contains the value 50 .
On a budget sheet, cell A5 contains a formula to calculate the current budget.

\section*{=IF(A2<=100,"Within budget",'"Over budget")}

If the result of the formula in A5 is less than or equal to 100, then the function displays "Within budget". Otherwise, the function displays "Over budget".
Example 2.
=IF(A2=100,SUM(B5:B15),"'")
In this example, if the value in cell A2 is 100 , then the condition is TRUE, and the total value for the range B5:B15 is calculated. Otherwise, condition is FALSE, an empty text ("'") is returned that leaves the cell that contains the IF function blank.
22. COUNTIF:

Counts the number of cells within a specified range that meet the given condition or criteria. E.g. Suppose A10:E10 contains eggs, beans, eggs, eggs, typing in E12 =Countif(A10:E10, "Eggs") will return 3.

\section*{23. SUMIF:}

It adds values in the cells specified by a given condition or criteria. E.g. if A10 to E10 contains values $10,50,60,30,70$, to sum all values greater than 50 in cell E12 $=\operatorname{sumif}(\mathrm{A} 10: \mathrm{E} 10$, " $>50 ")$. This returns 130 .

\section*{NESTING FUNCTIONS WITHIN FUNCTIONS.}

You can use a function as one of the arguments of another function.
Note. When a function is used as an argument, it must return the same type of value that the argument uses.

\section*{Example}
$=I F(S U M(K 10: K 19)>=5000,10 \%, 5 \%)$
In this example, the SUM function is being nested. Assume that the result of the SUM function is 935. Since the sum of the range K10:K19 is not greater than or equal to 5000 , the result is $5 \%$.

\section*{EDIT/ CHANGE A FORMULA.}
1. Select the cell containing the formula you want to edit.
2. Click in the Formula bar, make the changes to the formula, then press the ENTER key.

Note. If formulas are not used, there will be no automatic recalculation when any of the numbers change.
Automatic recalculation:

This means that, Spreadsheets are able to calculate values such as SUM, AVERAGES, PERCENTAGES, etc automatically without requiring the intervention of the user (or without putting the user into the hard task of thinking).

\section*{COPYING A FORMULA.}
- You can copy (or fill) formulas into a range of cells. This reduces the effort \& time taken to insert similar formulas in other cells, especially in a large worksheet.
Note. When you copy a formula, Absolute cell references do not change but Relative cell references will change.
A Relative reference is a cell reference, which changes automatically when the formula is copied to another cell or range. It describes the location of a cell in terms of its distance (in rows and columns) from another cell. i.e. When you copy a formula containing relative references down or across from one cell to another, Ms-Excel adjusts the references in the pasted formula automatically to refer to a different cell that is the same no. of rows \& columns away from the formula.

\section*{Example:}

If cell A3 contains the formula =A1+A2, and you copy cell A3 to cell B3, the formula in cell B 3 becomes $=\mathrm{B} 1+\mathrm{B} 2$.

Absolute cell reference: In a formula, an Absolute cell reference is the exact address of a cell, regardless of the position of the cell that contains the formula.
An absolute cell reference takes the form $\$ \mathrm{~A} \$ 1, \$ \mathrm{~B} \$ 1$, etc.
The table below shows the different types of references.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Reference: & Effect on a cell reference \\
\hline A1 & Relative reference. \\
\hline$\$ A \$ 1$ & Both rows and column references are absolute \\
\hline A $\$ 1, \mathrm{~B} \$ 1$ & Absolute row reference, i.e., only the row reference is absolute. \\
\hline$\$ A 1, \$ B 1$ & Absolute column reference, i.e., only the column reference is absolute. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Unlike relative references, Absolute references don't automatically adjust when you copy formulas across rows and down columns. For example, if you copy an absolute reference in cell B2 to cell B3, it stays the same in both cells.
Therefore, if you don't want Ms-Excel to adjust references when you copy a formula to a different cell, use Absolute referencing.

\section*{For example,}

The formula as follows: $=\$ \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\$} \mathbf{5} \mathbf{\$ C} \mathbf{\$ 1}$. Cannot change when copied to any other cell in a worksheet.
Note. To enter the dollar sign in a cell reference; move the cell pointer in the cell reference to be made absolute, then press the function key $\mathbf{F 4}$ or the keyboard combination SHIFT+4.

\section*{Worked Example:}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & ABC Company Sales Performance Report & \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & & & & & & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & Salesman & Target & Qtr1 & Qtr2 & Qtr3 & Qtr4 & Total & Commission \\
\hline $\mathbf{4}$ & Albert & 750 & 148 & 156 & 171 & 140 & 615 & =G4*\$\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{5}$ & Carl & 650 & 122 & 131 & 153 & 118 & 524 & $=$ G5*\$\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{6}$ & Cornell & 800 & 211 & 243 & 246 & 250 & 950 & =G6*\$\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{7}$ & Edwin & 700 & 129 & 150 & 92 & 218 & 589 & $=$ G7*\$A\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{8}$ & Francis & 1,000 & 311 & 270 & 247 & 322 & 1,150 & $=$ G8*\$A\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{9}$ & & & & & & & & \\
\hline $\mathbf{1 0}$ & Totals & 3,900 & 921 & 950 & 909 & 1,048 & 7,728 & $=$ G10*\$A\$13 \\
\hline $\mathbf{1 1}$ & & & & & & & & \\
\hline $\mathbf{1 2}$ & Commission Rate & & & & & & & \\
\hline $\mathbf{1 3}$ & $\mathbf{1 5 \%}$ & & & & & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To get the commission for each salesperson, the formula $=\mathbf{G 4} \mathbf{*} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\$ 1 3}$ is entered in cell H 4 . The dollar sign (\$) indicates an absolute reference to the cell A13. This means that, whenever the commission rate formula is copied, it always refers to cell A13.
When the formula $=G 4 * \$ A \$ 13$ is copied down to H 10 , the results will be as shown.

\section*{FORMULAS AND ERROR VALUES.}

If a formula cannot properly evaluate a result, Ms-Excel will display an error value.
For example, error values can be as a result of using text where a formula expects a numeric value, deleting a cell that is referenced by a formula, or using a cell that is not wide enough to display the result.
1. \#\#\#\#\#

Causes.
- This error value occurs when the cell contains a number, date or time that is wider than the cell. -OR-
- It occurs when the cell contains a date or a time formula that produces a negative result.

Suggested action.
(i). Increase the width of the column by dragging the boundary between the column headings.
(ii). Apply a different number format in the cell to make the number fit within the existing cell width. E.g., decrease the no. of decimal places after the decimal point.
(iii). Ensure that the data and time formulas are correct. When you subtract dates and times, make sure you build the formula correctly.

If a formula has a result of a negative value, you can display the value by formatting the cell with a format that is not a date or time format.
1. Click Format menu, click the Number tab, then select a format that is not a date or time format.
2. \#N/A

The \#NA error value occurs when a value is not available to a function or formula.

\section*{Possible cause}

\section*{Suggested action}
(i). Omitting 1 or more arguments in a function Enter all arguments in the function.
(ii). Using a custom worksheet function that is $\begin{aligned} & \text { Make sure the function is working } \\ & \text { not available properly }\end{aligned}$

\section*{3. \#DIV/0!}

This error value occurs when you enter a formula that contains a division by zero (0). E.g., $=\mathbf{5 / 0}$. It may also occur when you divide a cell by another cell that is blank.

\section*{Suggested action.}
(i). Change the divisor to a number other than zero.

\section*{4. \#NULL!}

The \#NULL! error value occurs when you specify an intersection of two areas that do not intersect. i.e., using an incorrect range operator or using an incorrect cell reference. The formula refers to an invalid range.

\section*{Suggested action.}
(i). Use the correct range operator. For instance, to refer to two areas that don't intersect, use the Comma.
E.g. if the formula sums two ranges, separate the two ranges with a comma.
$=\operatorname{SUM}(A 1: A 9, ~ C 1: C 6)$.
(ii). Check for typing errors in the reference to the ranges.

\section*{5. \#NAME?}

The \#NAME? error value occurs when Ms-Excel doesn't recognize text in a formula.

\section*{Possible cause}
(i). Deleting a name used in the formula, or using a name that does not exist
(ii). Misspelling the name of a function
(iii). Omitting a colon (:) in a range reference
(iv). Entering text in a formula without enclosing the text in double quotation marks ("). Ms-Excel tries to interpret your entry as a name even though you intended it to be used as text.

\section*{Suggested action}

Make sure the name exists.

Correct the spelling.
Make sure all range references in the formula use a colon. E.g. $=$ SUM(A1:A5)

Enclose text in the formula in double quotation marks.
E.g. the following formula joins a piece of text "The total amount is" with the value in cell B5:
$=$ "The total amount is" \& B5

\section*{6. \#NUM!}

This occurs when a problem occurs with a number in a formula or function. E.g., Entering a formula that produces a number to a number that is too large or too small to be represented in Ms-Excel.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{Suggested action}
(i). Change the formula so that its result is between $-1 * 10^{307}$ and $1 * 10^{307}$.
7. \#VALUE!

The \#VALUE error value occurs when the wrong type of argument or operand is used.
8. \#REF!

The \#REF error value occurs when a cell reference is not valid. For instance, deleting cells referred to by other formulas, or pasting moved cells over cells referred to by other formulas.

\section*{Suggested action}
(i). Change the formulas, or restore the cells on the worksheet by clicking Undo immediately after you delete or paste the cells.
9. CIRCULAR: Error appears on the status bar. The formula either indirectly refers to the same cell in which the formula is written.

\section*{Exercise.}
1. You have entered a formula to add the contents of B5 and C4 in cell F5. What will it become when you copy it to cell H 8 ?

Explain the reason for your answer.
2. What causes the following error messages in Microsoft Excel. Show how we can solve them.
(i). \#\#\#\#\#
(ii). \#VALUE!
(iii). \#DIV/0!
(iv). \#NAME?
3. The first column in the table below contains formulas as entered into the cell D46. In the second column, enter the formulas as they would appear when copied to B56.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Formula in D46 & Formula when copied to B56 \\
\hline =D1 & \\
\hline =F5*C10 & \\
\hline$=\mathrm{H} \$ 46+\mathrm{J} 40$ & \\
\hline$=\$ E 12-\mathrm{D} \$ 14 * \$ \mathrm{~F} \$ 2$ & \\

\section*{DATA SORTING.}

Sorting is the process of arranging data within a range in a particular order.
Purpose.
~ Sorting helps in arranging data in some order of priority, i.e., from lowest to highest or from highest to lowest.
~ It also helps to quickly locate the highest or lowest value in a list.
When you sort, Ms-Excel rearranges rows, columns, or individual cells by using the sort order that you specify. You can sort a list in Ascending (1-9, A-Z) or Descending order (9-1, Z-A). You can perform a sort based on the contents of one or more columns.
Note. The data is sorted in reference to columns.
To sort rows in ascending or descending order based on the contents of one column.
1. Click a cell in the column by which you want to sort. The column on which the list is arranged is known as the Key.
2. To arrange the data from lowest to highest, click on the Sort and filter button on the Home Tab.

\section*{To sort rows based on the contents of two or more columns.}
1. Click a cell in the list you want to sort.
2. On the Data tab, click Sort to display the Sort dialog box.
3. Under Sort By, specify the first column by which you want to sort, then choose the sort order by clicking on the Ascending or Descending box.

\section*{Sort columns based on the contents of rows.}
1. Click a cell in the list you want to sort.
2. On the Data tab, click Sort.
3. Click the Options button.
4. Under Orientation, click Sort left to right, then click OK.
5. In the Sort by and Then by, click the rows you want to sort.

\section*{CREATING CHARTS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
- Charts are used to present data effectively. They make relationships among numbers easy for users to see because they turn numbers into shapes that can be compared to one another.
For instance, rather than having to analyze several columns on worksheet numbers, you can see at a glance whether sales are falling or rising over quarterly periods, or how the actual sales compare to the projected sales.

\section*{Different Types of Charts and their uses.}
(i). Line Chart: A Line graph is used to show trends.
(ii). Bar Chart: - It can be used to show comparison of Sales and Target.
(iii). A Stacked Bar Chart: - It can be used to show the distribution of sales by month and compare the performance of salesmen.
(iv). A Pie Chart: shows the distribution of sales.
(v). Scatter Charts.
(vi). Column Charts.

\section*{Steps required when creating a simple chart.}
1. Enter the data you want to be represented in the chart on the worksheet.
2. Select the cells or range that contains the data you want to be represented in chart.

If the cells you want to select for your chart are not in a continuous range,
- Select the first group of cells that contain the data you want to include.
- Hold down the CTRL, then select any additional cell groups you want to include. The nonadjacent selections must form a rectangle.
3. On the Insert tab, click Chart Launcher. Then use the Chart Wizard to help you through the process of choosing the chart type and the various chart options.
4. Select Chart type.
- In the Chart type dialog box, click the Standard Types tab or the Custom Types tab.
- Under Chart Type, click the chart category you want to use, then select the type of chart under Chart subtypes on the right.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

A brief description of the chart selected appears below the sub-types. This helps you decide whether the type suits the data you have selected. You may also view a sample of the chart that will be produced.
- Click on the Next button.
5. Specify the range of cells to include in the chart.

This gives you a chance to select your range again if necessary.
In the Chart Source data dialog box,
- Click the Data range tab, then confirm the selected range or enter a new range.
- Under Series in, click an option to change the way in which the data should be plotted; across Rows or down Columns. To help you decide the right option, the sample chart changes according to the selection you have made.
- If you are sure about the range you have selected and the sample chart is what is desired, click on the Next button.

3. Apply any formatting that is appropriate for your needs.

Adding other Slides to a Presentation.
(i). On the Home Tab or Insert tab, choose New Slide under slides commands.

\section*{Using the Different PowerPoint Views.}

\section*{- PowerPoint has six views that help you to view or work on your presentations in different ways.}

The View buttons are usually located at the bottom left of the status bar OR Select one of the options from the View Tab under presentation views commands.
1. Normal View: Normal View simultaneously displays the Slide, Outline, and Notes views in their own, allowing you to see everything at once.
These panes let you work on all aspects of your presentation in one place. You can adjust the size of the different panes by dragging the pane border.
In the Outline pane, you can organize and develop the content of your presentation. You can type all the text of your presentation and rearrange bullet points, paragraphs, and slides.
In the Slide pane, you can see how your text looks on each slide. You can add graphics, movies, and sounds create hyperlinks and add animations to individual slides.
In the Notes pane, you can add your speaker notes or information you want to share with the audience.
2. Slide View: Slide view is the default view when you open or create a presentation. In Slide view, you can work with the text in your presentation one slide at a time.
3. Outline View: Outline view allows you to see all the titles, text, etc of the entire presentation in a single window.
In the Outline view, the text appears exactly the way it appears when you work with Microsoft Word, i.e., you can see how your main points flow from slide to slide.

In Outline view, each slide is numbered. A Slide icon appears to the left of each slide's title. The text below each Slide title is indented. This is the same text contained in that particular slide.
In Outline view, you can edit the text, add and delete slides, move text between slides and change the order of the slides themselves.

A miniature slide appears above the speaker's notes. you can also print a copy of your notes for reference.
6. Slide Show:

Slide Show view displays slides on the entire screen the way the audience will view the final presentation.

\section*{APPLYING A DIFFERENT DESIGN TO A PRESENTATION. On the Design Tab, click Design Template.}

\section*{SAVING A PRESENTATION.}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
o The work done is currently stored only in the computer RAM; to save your work for further use you must save the presentation to the Hard Disk or Secondary Memory.
- You can save the presentation you are working on. You can also save a copy of it with a different name or in a different location.
- You can save any presentation in a Web format, such as HTML so that it can be viewed and used on the Internet.
- You can also save a presentation so that whenever you open it, it always starts as a slide show.

Note. A typical PowerPoint presentation has a .ppt filename extension, while a file saved as a slide show has a .pps extension.

\section*{INSERTING A CHART.}
- A chart allows you to graphically display data that is contained in a table or spreadsheet.
- Charts help in summarizing information in graphical form, and thereby make the information easier to understand.
Adding charts to a presentation can add impact to your presentation.
(i). PowerPoint starts Microsoft Graph, which is the application used to create and edit charts.

A datasheet and chart window will appear, and they contain default data, which can be replaced with your own data.
(ii). Using the datasheet, enter the data for the chart and then close the datasheet.

Working with the Datasheet.
The datasheet is made up of rows and columns. A group of related data representing one row or column from the table is called a Data series.

\section*{Changing and Formatting a Chart.}
- After creating a chart, you can select a new type of chart that will better suit the data, or format your chart type to achieve the results you want.
- A chart gallery allows you change your chart type and then automatically format the chart.

Changing the Chart's Appearance (Formatting). (Chart area, Chart title, Plot area, Axes (Y-axis, Xaxis, Z-axis), Legend, Gridlines, etc.
The Clip Gallery. The Microsoft Clip Gallery contains a wide variety of Clip Art images, pictures, sounds, video clips and movies that you can insert and use in your presentation. It is in the Clip Gallery where we choose the images to use in the presentations.

\section*{INSERTING CLIPART PICTURES IN A PRESENTATION.}

\section*{Inserting a scanned picture.}

Scaling a picture means resizing an entire object, or picture by a certain percentage.
Cropping the Picture: You can trim portions of a picture, so that you don't see all of it. Basically, the original picture is not altered in any way. Photos are often cropped to focus attention on a particular area of the photo.
Inserting a Microsoft Word Table. You can insert other types of objects like Microsoft Word tables, Excel worksheets or charts, WordArt objects, scanned photographs or other applications into PowerPoint. Note. Once the table is inserted, you can perform all sorts of functions on it like sorting, calculations, enhancing, aligning text and numbers, and so on.
Inserting Drawing Objects: To add drawings and modify them in order to enhance the look and content of the presentation. You can draw objects such as squares, rectangles, polygons, lines, ellipses, textboxes, or even combine different shapes. These are referred to as AutoShapes.
Resizing the Drawing Object. Drag the resize handles (the fill handles).
A dotted outline of the drawing or shape appears as you drag showing you the new size.

\section*{Grouping or Ungrouping Objects:}

Grouping objects means combining them so that you can work with them as one single object.
This technique can help you to build complex drawings.
- You can rotate, and resize or scale all objects in a group as a single unit.
- You can also change the attributes of all objects in a group at the same time. For example, you might change the fill color or add a shadow to all objects in the group.
You can 'ungroup' a group of objects at any time, and you can easily 'regroup' them by selecting any one of the objects that was previously grouped.

\section*{ANIMATING SLIDE TEXT AND OBJECTS.}
- Animation effects are usually added to slides so as to add interest to the presentation.
- They also assist the presenter to control the flow of information and to focus on important points.

Slide Text refers to any text that appears on the slides. Slide Objects refers to all other objects like drawing, ClipArt pictures, charts, tables, etc that are included in the slides.
Animation effects are special visual effects or sound effects that are added to text or objects on a slide, e.g., Fly from Top, Wipe left, etc.

Animating Slide text and objects means adding special visual effects or even sound effects to text or an object on a slide. For example, you can have the text appear one word, or letter at a time from the top of the screen.

\section*{SETTING SLIDE TRANSITIONS AND SLIDE TIMINGS.}
- A Slide Transition is a special visual effect that is used to introduce a slide during a slide show. Slide transitions are usually added to slides to create added impact to a presentation.
Examples of slide transitions include effects like Wipe Down, Box in, Cut, Checkerboard Across, Dissolve, Fade Out, Cover Down, etc.
- Slide Timing refers to the length of time a slide appears on the screen. If you don't want to manually move through a slide show by clicking the mouse, you can set the length of time a slide appears on the screen. This allows the presenter to be in control of time during a presentation.
Note. Microsoft PowerPoint places a transition symbol below the selected slide. This shows you that the slide has a transition effect.

\section*{Applying Slide Timings.}

There are 2 ways you can set slide timings on the screen.
(i). By setting the time manually for each slide, and then run the slide show and view the timings you set.
(ii). By using the rehearsal feature, where you can record timings automatically as you rehearse. You can also adjust the timings you've already set and then rehearse the new ones.
Note. In Slide Show, clicking a mouse always advances a slide, even if the timing set has not yet elapsed.
Note. As with animations and transitions, you can see the slide timings for the slides when in Slide

\section*{Sorter view.}

\section*{CREATING A SLIDE SHOW.}

There are 2 ways to advance your slide show; Automatically or Manually.
$\sim$ You can click the mouse manually to move your slides through the slide show.
~ You can use the Automatic Advance timing feature to move your slides through the slide show automatically. It keeps the slides for the time you specify in the Advance box in the Set Up Show. Under Show type, select the Loop continuously until 'Esc' checkbox. In the Slides area, select the
slides you want to show. If you want all the slides, choose All. If you just want to view particular slides, then type in the slides in the appropriate section.

\section*{ENTERING SPEAKER NOTES.}
- Speaker Notes are the notes that a presenter uses as 'cue cards' or reminders in the course of giving a slide show.
These notes are usually printed and they help the presenter to remember key points during a presentation.
Speaker Notes can be typed in using the Notes Pages view.
- Each slide has a notes page that includes a smaller version (miniature) of the slide and space for speaker notes.
- You can create notes pages while you are creating your presentation and then use them as speaker notes when delivering the presentation. On the View tab, click Notes Page. On the File menu, click Print and then click Notes Page in the Print What box.

\section*{USING THE SLIDE MASTER.}
- A Master is a special slide or page on which you define formatting for all slides or pages in your presentation.
- A Slide Master is the slide that holds information such as; Text, Pictures, background items or any special formatting which you want to appear on every slide in a presentation.
- If you make a change to the Slide Master, the change affects all the slides in your presentation based on the Master. To display the Slide Master, on the View Tab, select Master, and then click Slide Master. The Slide Master appears showing the different areas of the slide, e.g., the title, date, footer, and number areas as well as the text area.
- You can also create other types of masters in the same way. These include:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { (i). } & \text { Title masters. } \\
\text { (ii). } & \text { Handout masters. } \\
\text { (iii). } & \text { Notes masters. }
\end{array}$$

\section*{INSERTING HEADERS AND FOOTERS.}

You can use headers and footers to add information such as the date and time of the presentation, the slide or page number.
On the Insert Tab, click Header and Footer.

\section*{Exercise.}
1. What is the difference between Animation effects and Transition effects on a slide?
2. (i). What is a Slide Master?
(ii).What kind of information is usually included on a Slide Master?
3. (i). What are Speaker Notes?
(ii). In what view can you type in Speaker Notes?

\section*{ORGANIZATION CHARTS.}

An Organization chart is a diagram showing/describing the hierarchy of staff in an organization, or the flow of a process. An Organization chart is constructed in a similar manner to a family tree.

\section*{Uses of an Organization chart.}

In most organizations, the charts are constructed/used:
- To show lines of authority in the organization and all the workers and their titles.
- To show processes or functions.

There are different types of organization charts, but the most common are; Vertical and Horizontal organization charts or a combination of the two.

\section*{Formatting an Organization Chart.}
- All elements of the organization chart can be formatted. These include; the chart title, chart boxes, the connecting lines, etc.

\section*{Printing a presentation.}
- You can print slides from a presentation when you want to get hard copies of them. In addition, you can also print speaker notes, audience handouts, outlines, etc.

\section*{Presentation Tips.}
~ An effective presentation is well prepared and carefully planned.
$\sim$ An effective presentation is more than just slides that contain text and shapes. It often combines text, shapes, charts, colour, and sometimes sound or movies to produce a successful communication tool. This is due to the fact that, most people retain $40 \%-50 \%$ more information when they see and hear simultaneously rather than from just listening.

\section*{Characteristics of an Effective presentation.}

Effective presentations have some common characteristics, which should improve communication between the speaker and the audience.
Simplicity: Good presentations are simple and to the point. They are not long-winded and boring or complicated. They are easy for the speaker to present and easy for the audience to understand.
Visuals: Good presentations make use of a lot of visuals, i.e., graphics, pictures, ClipArt, charts, etc.
Colour: A good presentation usually has a lot of colour. Compared to a black and white presentation, a colour presentation attracts a lot of attention. However, the use of colour must be judicious (sensible / well judged), otherwise, the presentation will end up being overly 'colourful' and too flashy.

\section*{DATABASE}

\section*{Database?}
* It is a collection of information related to a particular subject or purpose.

\section*{DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS).}
* These are programs used to store \& manage files or records containing related information.
* A DBMS is a tool that allows one to create, maintain, update and store the data within a database.

A DBMS is a complex software, which creates, expands \& maintains the database, and it also provides the interface between the user and the data in the database.

Through the DBMS, users communicate their requirements to the database using Data Description Languages (DDL's) \& Data Manipulation Languages (DML's).
In fact, the DBMS provide an interface between the user's programs and the contents of the database.
Note. Database Management System (DBMS) is used for database;
1. Creation.
2. Manipulation.
3. Control, and
4. Report generation.

Example of DBMS include MS Access, Oracle, FoxPro, MySQL, Dbase IV etc.
The person who manages the DBMS is called the DBA (database Administrator)

\section*{DATABASE MODELS}

\section*{(1). Relational database model.}

A Relational database is a set of data where all the items are related.
The data elements in a Relational database are stored or organized in tables. A Table consists of rows \& columns. Each column represents a Field, while a row represents a Record. The records are grouped under fields.
- A Relational database is flexible and easy to understand.
- A Relational database system, has the ability to quickly find \& bring information stored in separate tables together using queries, forms, \& reports. This means that, a data element in any one table can be related to any piece of data in another table as long as both tables share common data elements.
Examples of Relational database systems;

\section*{(i). Microsoft Access.}

\section*{(2).Hierarchical database model.}

It is a data structure where the data is organized like a family tree or an organization chart.
In a Hierarchical database, the records are stored in multiple levels. Units further down the system are subordinate to the ones above.
In other words, the database has branches made up of parent and child records. Each parent record can have multiple child records, but each child can have only one parent.

\section*{Components of Data hierarchy.}

\section*{(3).Network Database Model.}

A Network database model represents many-to-many relationships between data. It allows a data element or record to be related to more than one other data element or record. For example, an employee can be associated with more than one department.
(4). Object-Oriented Model

Object-oriented databases use small, recyclable separated piece of software called objects. The objects themselves are stored in the object-oriented database. Each object contains of two elements:
1. Piece of data (e.g., sound, video, text, or graphics).
2. Instructions, or software programs called methods, for what to do with the data.

\section*{Common features of a database packages.}
(i). Have facilities for Creating databases.
(ii). Have facilities for Updating records or databases.
(iii). Have facilities for generating Reports.
(iv). Have a Find or Search facility that enables the user to scan through the records in the database so as to find information he/she needs.
(v). Allow Sorting that enables the user to organize \& arrange the records within the database.
(vi). Contain Query \& Filter facilities that specify the information you want the database to search or sort.
(vii). Have a data Validating facility.

\section*{Parts of MS Access Window}

Methods of creating an Ms-Access Database file.

- Under New from template, click General templates. In the File New Database dialog box, specify a name \& location for the database. Click on the Create button, then follow the instructions in the Wizard to define your new database.

\section*{Ms Access Objects}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Tables & \begin{tabular}{l} 
In Access, data is stored in tables. A table is a set of columns and rows, with \\
each column referred to as a field. Each value in a field represents a single type \\
of data. Each row of a table is referred to as a record.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Queries & \begin{tabular}{l} 
You use queries to retrieve specific data from your database and to answer \\
questions about your data. For example, you can use a query to find the names \\
of the employees in your database who live in a particular state.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Forms & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Forms give you the ability to choose the format and arrangement of fields. You \\
can use a form to enter, edit, and display data.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Reports & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Reports organize or summarize your data so you can print it or view it \\

\section*{DATABASE TABLES.}

A Table is a collection of data about a specific topic.

\section*{Defining the structure of a database Table.}

Tables organize data into columns (called fields) \& rows (called records).
i. Field Name: Each column in a database table is called a Field.

Field name is the name that identifies each column (i.e., it is the title of a field or column).
ii. Field Type: This specifies the type of data to be used/ stored in the field.
iii. Field Size: Specifies the maximum no. of characters that can be typed in that column.
iv. Field width - the no. of spaces required to hold the largest data item to be stored in the field.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_04_50a71b8b74d0265083b9g-107.jpg?height=470&width=1167&top_left_y=697&top_left_x=273)

A Data type is the characteristic of a field that determines what type of data it can store / hold.

\section*{Field Data types available in Ms-Access.}
1. Short Text.

Alphanumeric data. Use for text and for numbers that are not used in mathematical calculations. Use for names, addresses, and other relatively short pieces of text. Can store up to 255 characters.
2. Long Text / Memo.

Long text. Use for long pieces of text, such as notes and long descriptions. Can store up to 65,536 characters.
3. Number.

A Number field is used to store numeric data that would be included in mathematical calculations.
Note. A Number field only stores Whole numbers (i.e., numbers without decimal values) from 0 to 255.
4. Currency.

A Currency field is used for currency values or to store any calculations that involve money or that require a high degree of accuracy. This prevents rounding off during calculations.
5. Date/Time.

A Date or Time field is used to store dates and times depending on the formats chosen.
It stores 8 characters.
6. Yes/No.

Used for data that can be only one of two possible values, such as Yes/No, True/False, On/Off.
7. AutoNumber.

AutoNumber is a field data type that automatically stores a unique number for each record as it is added to a table.

It automatically numbers the records in the table. It is used for unique Sequential (incrementing by 1 )
8. OLE Object.

An OLE Object field allows one to bring data \& files from another program into the current field.
Used for OLE objects (such as Ms -Word documents, Ms -Excel spreadsheets, Pictures, or Sounds) those were created in other programs using the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) protocol.
9. Calculated

They calculate values from other fields within a table, as well as built-in access functions then display the result of that calculation.

\section*{10. Hyperlink.}

A Hyperlink field links the fields to another table within the same database or in a different database.

\section*{11. Lookup Wizard.}

The Lookup Wizard is used to create a field that allows you to choose a value from another table or from a list of values using a combo box.

CREATING A DATABASE TABLE.
Ms-Access provides 3 ways of creating a blank (empty) table;
(1).Use the Table Wizard. The Wizard enables the user to choose the fields for the table from a variety of predefined tables such as Business contacts, Household inventory, or Medical records.
(2). Create a table in Design view where you can add fields, define how each field appears or handles data, and create a primary key.
(3).Enter data directly into a blank datasheet. When you save the new datasheet, Ms-Access will analyze your data and automatically assign the appropriate data type and format for each field.
Datasheet view - A window that displays data from a Table, Form, or Query, in a row-andcolumn format. In Datasheet view, you can edit fields, add and delete data, and search for data.
A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. No two records in a table should have the same values in every field.

\section*{FIELD PROPERTIES.}

The table's Design view is divided into 2 parts. The lower part is used to display and assign field properties to selected fields.

Field properties - a set of characteristics that provide additional control over how the data in a field is stored, entered, or displayed.

Each data type has a different set of properties.
The different field properties include:

\section*{(i). FieldSize.}

The FieldSize property defines/ controls the maximum no. of characters that can be entered/ stored in a Text or Number field.
(ii). Format.

The Format property specifies how (the way) data is displayed in a field \& printed.
Number \& Currency fields provide predefined display formats. They include Currency, Fixed, General, Percent, Scientific, General data, Medium date, Medium time.

(iii). Decimal places.

It is used to define the no. of decimal places in values. This option is used on fields that already have the Fixed format such as in Number and Currency fields.
(iv). Default value.

It allows you to define a value that will automatically be inserted into the field as you add new records. It is used in Text and Memo fields.
For example, to insert the current date in the Admission date field use "Date ()".
The default value affects only new records inserted.
(v). Validation Rule.

It allows you to create an expression or a formula that will test data when being entered into the field.
It automatically rejects faulty/flawed entries, e.g., entering very large or very small figures in the Age or Salary fields.

Validation Rule
Between 18 and 55
$<10000$
<=500 AND <=1000
>Date( )
<Date( )

\section*{Description}

Limits an age field from 18 to 55.
Allows any value less than 10000
Accepts any entry between 500 and 1000.
Allows entries whose dates are the current date or later.
Allows the current date and before.

Note. To test whether the Validation rule is applicable, choose Test Validation Rules on the Edit menu.
(vi). Validation Text.

Text for error messages that are sent when validation rules are broken. Enter a useful message that can be clearly understood by the input clerk.
(vii). Required.

It controls the entry of important fields.
When this option is set to YES, an entry must be made within that field, i.e., it ensures that the field is not left blank.
A YES option is equivalent of typing $\operatorname{IS}$ NOT NULL as a field Validation rule.
(viii). Input Mask.

Let's you define a pre-formatted pattern for the entry of data into a Date or a Text field. The data in that field must conform to a pattern. Special characters used to control the values the user can input.
Examples of data include:
$\mathbf{0 \# / 0 \# / 0 \#}$ - this forces a 2 -digits entries for the year, month and date in a date field.
A - Allows letters or digits into a field, but an entry is required.
9 - Allows letters or digits in a field, but no entry is required.
000000 - Allows a 6-digit number (not more or less than that).
999999 - Allows 6 or less digits.
AAAAA - only 5 characters are to be entered.
> - converts the field entry to Uppercase.

\section*{(ix). Allow Zero Length.}

Applies to Text and Memo field data types.
Setting the value in Allow Zero Length property to YES and the Required property YES, the field must contain at least one character.
(x). Caption.

This is an alternative name used (other than the fieldname) in order to appear in the fieldname header button in Table datasheet view and as a label in Forms.
They provide a neat and descriptive name since the fieldname should be kept small for practical use.
(xi). Indexed.
[Yes (Duplicates OK)] - Gives sorted, indexed field and can allow data duplicates.
[Yes (No duplicates)] - Gives sorted, indexed field but cannot allow data duplicates.
Note. It is not available for Memo or OLE object data types.
Primary key is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a database table.
Examples of key fields include - Identification numbers, Registration numbers, User codes, etc.
Using a Primary key is a way of telling Ms-Access to:
* Make sure no two records have the same value within that field.
* Keep records sorted by the entries of the Primary key fields.

There are 3 kinds of primary keys that can be defined in Ms-Access:

\section*{1. AutoNumber primary keys.}

An AutoNumber field can be set to automatically enter a sequential no. as each record is added to the table.
Choosing an AutoNumber field as the primary key for a table is the simplest way to create a primary key.

\section*{2. Single-field primary keys.}

If you have a field that contains unique values such as ID numbers, you can select that field as the primary key. You can specify a primary key for a field that already contains data as long as that field does not contain duplicate values or Null values.

\section*{3. Multiple-field primary keys.}

In situations where you cannot guarantee the uniqueness of any single field, you can choose two or more fields as the primary key.
This commonly arises in situations where a table is used to relate two other tables in a many-to-many relationship.

\section*{SORTING OF RECORDS.}

This allows you to arrange your records in a logical order in the database. It can either be in Ascending or Descending order - in Alphabetical, Chronological, or Numeric.
1. In Datasheet view, click in the field to be sorted.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{FREEZING AND UNFREEZING OF COLUMNS.}

Freezing makes the selected column to remain fixed on the screen while scrolling. This enables the user to see the data in a column especially in a database table with very many columns.

When a column is freezed, it stays at the left-most position while the rest of the columns continue to move or scroll in and out of view.

Unfreeze is removing the Freeze command.
FILTERING OF RECORDS.
Filtering refers to sieving/ examining out particular records from the database. The records you sieve/ select out can be printed, deleted, or edited.

There are 3 types of filters in Access.
(i). Filter by Selection.

This filter allows you to choose a criteria for sieving out records by selecting them directly from the table in Datasheet view.

\section*{(ii). Filter by Form.}

This filter opens up a Form where you can give a more elaborate criterion.
A Form will appear where you can type in or choose the criteria you want, e.g., To list all people called Philip, click under First Name, then type 'Philip' or chose it from the drop down list.

\section*{(iii). Advanced Filter/Sort.}

This filter allows one to sort and filter at the same time.
Note. You can sort and filter at the same time or you can perform each independently.
Note. To remove a filter and get back the original table, click Remove Filter/Sort on the Records menu.

Advanced Filter/Sort window - A window in which you can create a filter from scratch. You enter criteria expressions in the filter design grid to restrict the records in the open form or datasheet to a subset of records that meet the criteria.

\section*{RELATIONSHIPS IN A MS-ACCESS DATABASE FILE.}

To store your data, create one table for each type of information that you track.
After setting up the different tables for each subject, you can define relationships between the tables.

Relationship - An association established between common fields (columns) in two tables.
Defining relationships is a way of telling Ms-Access how to bring information/ data from multiple tables back together again in a query, form, or report.

After defining the relationship, you can create queries, forms, and reports to display information from several tables at once.

\section*{Relating two tables.}

In order to relate two tables, each table should include a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies each record stored in the table. Such a field is called the Primary key of the table.

The Primary key field relates two tables so that Ms-Access can bring together the data from the two tables for viewing, editing, or printing.
In one table, the field is a Primary key that you set in table Design view. That same field also exists in the related table as a Foreign key.

\section*{QUERIES.}

A Query is a question about the data stored in your tables, or a request to perform an action on the data.

You use queries to view, change, and analyze data in different ways.
A query can find \& bring together data that meets conditions that you specify from multiple tables. It can also serve as the source of data for a Form, or a Report.
A query can also update or delete multiple records at the same time, and perform predefined or custom calculations on your data.
There are 4 major types of queries in Microsoft Access.

\section*{(1). SELECT QUERIES.}

A Select query is a query that asks a question about the data stored in your tables and returns a result set in the form of a datasheet-without changing the data.

\section*{Creating a Select query.}

You can create a query with a wizard or from scratch in Query Design view.
In Design view, you specify the data you want to work with by adding the tables or queries that contain the data, and then by filling in the Design grid.
- You add fields to the design grid by dragging them to the field lists.
- What you will see in the query's results will be determined by the fields, sort order, and criteria you add to the design grid.

\section*{(2). PARAMETER QUERIES}

A Parameter query is a query that when run displays its own dialog box prompting you for information, such as criteria for retrieving records or a value you want to insert in a field.
You can design the query to prompt you for more than one piece of information;
For example,
- You can design it to prompt you for two dates. Ms-Access can then retrieve all records that fall between those two dates.
- You can create a monthly earnings report based on a parameter query. When you print the report, Ms-Access displays a dialog box asking for the month that you want the report to cover. When you enter a month, Ms-Access prints the appropriate report.
(3). CROSSTAB QUERIES.

A Crosstab query is a query that calculates a Sum, Average, Count, or other type of total on records, and then groups the result by two types of information - one down the left side of the datasheet and the other across the top.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Use Crosstab queries to calculate and restructure your data for easy analysis.
Note. A Crosstab query displays the same information, but groups it both horizontally and

\section*{FORMS.}

A Form is an Access database object on which you place controls for taking actions or for entering, displaying, and editing data in fields.
A form is a type of a database object that is primarily used to enter or display data in a database.
To easily view, enter, and change data directly in a table, create a form. When you open a form, Microsoft Access retrieves the data from one or more tables, and displays it on the screen with the layout you choose in the Form Wizard, or with the layout that you created on your own in Design view.

\section*{Notes.}
- A form focuses on one record at a time, and it can display fields from more than one table. It can also display pictures and other objects.
- A form can contain a button that prints, opens other objects, or otherwise automates tasks. Most forms are bound to one or more tables and queries in the database. A form's record source refers to the fields in the underlying tables and queries. A form need not contain all the fields from each of the tables or queries that it is based on.

\section*{Creating a form}

You can create a form quickly by using the AutoForm command or a wizard. AutoForm creates a form that displays all fields and records in the underlying table or query. A wizard asks you questions and creates a form based on your answers. You can then customize the form the way you want it in Design view.

\section*{Customizing a form}

\section*{In Design view}

You can customize a form in Design view in the following ways:
Record source. Change the tables and queries that a form is based on.
Controlling and assisting the user. You can set form properties to allow or prevent users from adding, deleting, or editing records displayed in a form. You can also add custom Help to a form to assist your users with using the form.
Form window. You can add or remove Maximize and Minimize buttons, short cut menus, and other Form window elements.
Sections. You can add, remove, hide, or resize the header, footer, and details sections of a form. You can also set section properties to control the appearance and printing of a form.
Controls. You can move, resize, or set the font properties of a control. You can also add controls to display calculated values, totals, current date and time, and other useful information on a form.

\section*{REPORTS.}

A Report is an Access database object that prints information formatted and organized according to your specifications.
To analyze your data or present it a certain way in print, create a report. For example, you might print one report that groups data and calculates totals, and another report with different data formatted for printing mailing labels.
- Use a report to create mailing labels.
- Use a report to show totals in a chart.
- Use a report to calculate totals.

A report is an effective way to present your data in a printed format. Because you have control over the size and appearance of everything on a report, you can display the information the way you want to see it.
Most reports are bound to one or more table and query in the database. A report's record source refers to the fields in the underlying tables and queries. A report need not contain all the fields from each of the tables or queries that it is based on.
A bound report gets its data from its underlying record source. Other information on the form, such as the title, date, and page number, is stored in the report's design.
You create the link between a report and its record source by using graphical objects called controls. Controls can be text boxes that display names and numbers, labels that display titles, or decorative lines that graphically organize the data and make the report more attractive.

\section*{Creating a report}

You can create different types of reports quickly by using wizards. Use the Label Wizard to create mailing labels, the Chart Wizard to create charts, or the Report Wizard to create a standard report. The wizard asks you questions and creates a report based on your answers. You can then customize the report the way you want it in Design view.

\subsection*{7.0 DESKTOP PUBLISHING}

Publishing is the process of producing publications such as newspapers, cards, pamphlets, pictures, calendars, books, etc that has special text and graphical layouts \& designs.
Desktop publishing refers to the process of producing publications by designing their text and graphics layout using special desktop publishing software on computers. The text and graphical objects can be inserted, edited, formatted and printed using DTP Software.
Examples of desktop publishers;
- Adobe PageMaker
- Adobe Photoshop - mainly used for editing \& formatting photographs.
- Adobe illustrator - used for creating complex freehand artwork such as drawings \& logos.
- CorelDraw.
- Microsoft Publisher.
- Ventura.
- Harvard graphic.

\section*{Difference between a desktop publisher and a word processor.}
- A DTP software gives the user more tools and control of the page layout, text manipulation and graphic design than a word processor.
Purpose of Desktop publishing software
DTP programs give the typesetter (the person designing publications) a lot of control on:
(a). Graphic design:

Using DTP software, a typesetter can create and edit very complex text \& graphical objects of high quality.
For example, the software provides the user with rulers \& ruler guides that can be used to place an object in the correct position within the publication.
(b). Page layout design:

With a desktop publisher, the user can design a page layout by setting consistent (constant) picture and object locations, divide a page into a number of columns, and also create layers.
Layering is the arrangement of objects on top of each other with the one on top being on the first layer.

\section*{(c). Printing:}

To produce any publications, they must be printed. Therefore, DTP software helps the user to prepare artwork (i.e., publications that are ready for printing).

\subsection*{1.3 Types of Desktop publishing software}

There are 2 main types of DTP software:
i. Graphical based:

They are specifically developed for editing \& formatting graphic objects like pictures.
Examples; -Adobe Photoshop. - Harvard graphic. -CorelDraw.
Graphic-based desktop publishers have superior capabilities for handling images such as setting resolution, brightness, contrast, cropping, and filling the images with colour.
ii. Layout based:

They are specifically developed to create different page layout designs for text and pictures.
Examples; - Adobe PageMaker. - Microsoft Publisher.

\subsection*{1.5 Designing a publication}

Different publications have different design layouts and formatting.

\section*{Types of publications}

There are several types of publications that can be produced using DTP software. They include:
- Cards. Certificates: Newspapers, Magazines, Pamphlets and Newsletters: Books:
- Calendars: Notices, Brochures, Posters / Advertisement, and Catalogues.

\subsection*{1.5 Features of DTP software.}
1). Text can be entered directly into a DTP publication. Alternatively, the text can be entered into a Word processor and then copied into the DTP document.
- Graphics can be created in a separate program, then incorporated into a Desktop publishing program. A Scanner can also be used to copy images, such as photographs and drawings, into a Desktop publishing document. A Scanner is a device that reads text and images into a document.
2). A DTP program gives you more control over the graphics in a publication. You can:
- move - change the position of a graphic on a page,
- size - make a graphic larger or smaller,
- Rotate - turn or spin a graphic, and
- Crop - trim part of a graphic.
3). Has a wide range of Fonts \& print sizes that can be merged with useful symbols, such as arrows and stars.
4). Has Columns of various widths, in which the text is fitted automatically using sensible hyphenation. The columns can also be reorganization automatically.
5). Enables Scaling and cropping of publications so as to fit the available space.
6). Page numbers can be inserted.
7). Enables production of multiple page documents.

\section*{Microsoft Publisher}

A desktop Publishing program used to design, layout, and create text and picture-rich publications Why Publisher?
- Publisher offers excellent control over certain aspects of your publication.
- Publisher makes it easy to work with documents in a variety of sizes and shapes.
- It also has a large number of tools to help you arrange and align text, images, and other objects within page margins

\section*{Publisher Interface}

\section*{i) Publisher Organization Tools}

Publisher offers many tools to help organize and arrange content in your publication. Here are a few.
a) Baselines are evenly spaced horizontal lines that can be used to line up text. To show Baselines:
1. Click the View Tab
2. Look in the "Show" group
3. Check box next to "Baselines"

Baselines do not print.
To hide Baselines, uncheck Baselines box.
b) Boundaries are dark blue dashed borders that appear around objects. Viewing object boundaries can be useful to align objects or view text.
c) Rulers are on the left and top of the publication to help line up text, images, and other objects. When an object is selected, a white space will appear on the rulers to show the object's location.
d) Guides are thin lines that help to align objects. There are two types of guides:
i) Margin guides are blue lines that mark the edges, or margins, of a printable area; they are automatically created when page margins are set.
Margin guides are very important because; they define the printable area of your publication.
ii) Customizable guides are green lines that can be added anywhere in a publication. To add them:
1. Left-click and hold the horizontal or vertical ruler
2. Drag the mouse to the publication
3. Release to add the guide to a location

The guide will be placed, and it can be moved at any time by clicking and dragging it.

\section*{Example: Setting up columns}
1. Go to Page Design tab and click on Guides to see the options window.
2. Then click on Grid and Baseline Guides to open the Layout Guides box.
3. Go to Margin Guides: 1.50 " all around (leave Two-page master unchecked)
4. Then under Grid Guides: Columns choose 12 , set the spacing at 0.75 " (if it's grayed out, click first on the "Rows" box below it). Then click OK
e) Adding Pages

Page Setup: Page Layout, Page Orientation. Page Navigation is a pane to the left that displays an image of each page in the publication.
Page Numbers, Headers and Footers
ii) Working With Graphical Objects

Publisher provides three ways of adding graphics to a publication:
1. Drawing lines, ovals, circles, squares, rectangles, etc on a page using the drawing tools.
2. Importing pictures from other applications
3. Pasting all or part of a graphic from another publication using a Clipboard.

- Kerning refers to fixing of particular pairs of letters that are too close or too far apart from each other.
- Drop cap refers to text formatting where the first character in a line is bigger and drops down to occupy the space in the next lines
iv) Working With Master Pages

A Master page (also called the document master) is a page used to design a common layout to be applied in all the other pages of a publication.
A master page normally contains basic design elements such as headers and footers, page numbers, \& layout guides (i.e., column guides, ruler guides, \& margin guides) that are common to all pages in your publication.
Note. Master pages are important especially when creating a publication that has several pages such as a book or a project report. It ensures that there is consistency among all the pages in the publication.

\section*{Data Processing}

\section*{Introduction to Data Processing}

Data: Data are raw facts relating to an activity in a given environment. The activity can be accounting, inventory control etc. environment can be business, scientific, education etc. data are unprocessed information consisting of details relating to business environment.

Data Processing: Those activities which are concerned with the systematic recording, arranging, filing, processing and dissemination of facts relating to the physical events occurring in the business. Data Processing can also be described as the activity of manipulating the raw facts to generate a set or an assembly of meaningful data (information).

Information: Processed data directly useful in decision making. An assembly of meaningful data items. Information is achieved by applying some processing procedures on to the input raw data. Characteristics of a good information are:
- It is relevant to its purpose
- It is accurate and comprehensive
- It is obtained from a reliable source
- It is communicate to the right person in time
- It is understandable by the user.

In order to generate information from data items certain set of processes have to be performed in a set sequence depending on the desired ultimate result.

\section*{Why Data Processing?}

Data Processing has come into being to meet an increasing need for information under increasingly complex conditions. Eg it can assist in handling the paperwork for an ever increasing volume of data.

Through elimination of clerical operations, accuracy is ensured
Data processing can meet a company's needs, both financial and non-financial. It meets the financial needs by helping the company to reduce costs through maintaining the records nicely and reducing inventory and overhead costs. It meets non-financial needs e.g. by improving company's competitive position allowing for greater flexibility and providing the potential for rapid expansion.

\section*{Data Processing Cycles}

These are the various stages which are completed while processing the data. There are three primary elements of a data processing system; Input, Processing and Output. Data processing system or cycle can be explained by the help of the following;

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Activities of Data Processing Systems:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Function & Activities \\
\hline Input & Recording, Coding, Classifying, Editing, Converting \\
\hline Processing & Sorting, Calculating, Comparing, summarizing \\
\hline Output & Retrieving, Transmitting, Reporting \\
\hline Storage & Storing, maintaining, reproducing \\
\hline Control & Controlling \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Systems or Methods of Data Processing
1. Manual Method: The system function activities are carried out manually by the human clerks.
2. Mechanical Systems: Data Processing systems whose activities are carried out by human operated keyboards devices such as accounting machines, cash registers, calculators
3. Electronic Systems: Use of computers. Electronic data processing systems are made up of 4 basic elements; Computer Hardware, Computer Software, Live ware and Environmental factor.

\section*{Data Processing Modes}

Are classifications of different types of computer processing. They describe the ways these transactions are handled during processing. Various Data processing Modes or systems are;
i) Batch Processing (or off- line Processing)

This is the processing mode whereby the transactions are accumulated over a period of time then processed at a pre-specified time to produce a batch of output. Data collection is usually done off-line, in isolation of the CPU, on special machines called terminals. The data so collected is input after a fixed period, processed and the result obtained. Eg payroll preparation. One the processing of a given batch is started, there is no interractions between the operator (user) and the batch operating system.
Advantages
$\checkmark$ Simple to develop systems
$\checkmark$ Timing of the reports (information) not a necessity.
$\checkmark$ The unit cost of processing is low.

\section*{Disadvantages}
$\checkmark$ Time lag between origination of the transactions and the information availability
$\checkmark$ Late information is not suitable in situations where instant decision are required.

\section*{ii) Online Processing}

The type of processing where the results of data processing transaction is available immediately. All the computer peripherals are under the influence of the CPU. In this mode as soon as the input transaction are available they can be processed to produce information sought for. Eg. Banking systems, Stock Exchanges, Stock control, etc Advantages:
$\checkmark$ The files are maintained upto date.
$\checkmark$ The information is readily available for current decisions.

\section*{Disadvantages}
$\checkmark$ These systems are complex to develop
$\checkmark$ They are costly in terms of hardware, software, storage media, operating system

\section*{iii) Time Sharing Processing}

A Processing mode in which case the central processor serves two or more users with different processing requirements (tasks). The CPU is therefore, available to a variety of users, connected to the central computer via communication links. The processor time is divided out appropriately among the user tasks into time slices, control is switched from one job to another, under the influence of the operating system, and hence the processor's idle time is removed.
Advantages
$\checkmark$ Betters services to users, for the information /output is fast.
$\checkmark$ The problem of the processor idle time is solved for the processor has not to wait for the slower communicating peripherals.
$\checkmark$ It avoids duplication of software
Disadvantages:

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
$\checkmark$ The users have got no control over the central computer
$\checkmark$ The response time is slow when there are many tasks
$\checkmark$ It is not reliable as regards the security of data.

\section*{iv) Real time processing}

Data processing system in which the time-interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that the response itself is useful for control physical activities of a process. The characteristic of real time data processing that truly distinguishes it from the on-line systems is the immediacy of its response on receipt of a message. Applied in airline reservation systems.
Advantages:
$\checkmark$ The information is readily available for instant decision
$\checkmark$ Provides better service to users or customers
$\checkmark$ It is a fast and reliable mode of data processing

\section*{Disadvantages}
$\checkmark$ They are complex systems that use complex operating systems hence very expensive
$\checkmark \quad$ They are not easy to develop systems.
v) Distributed Processing

Data processing system consist of various geographically dispensed computers, linked by communication lines and the computers linked belong to the same organization. This implies that the computers are located at various departments or business sites for the business site or department to be served individually by its own computer resources. Advantages
$\checkmark$ Reduction of the load on the host computer
$\checkmark$ Minimization of costs in data processing due to the use of low cost minicomputers
$\checkmark$ Reduction of its delays in data processing
$\checkmark$ Less risk of system Break down
$\checkmark$ Less complexity of system design and implementation due to decentralization
Disadvantages
$\checkmark$ Expensive because of extra cost on communication equipment
$\checkmark$ Data duplication is very common

\section*{vi) Multi-programming / Multi-tasking}

A technique for handling two or more independent programs simultaneously by overlapping their execution or by loading them into primary storage and executing their instructions concurrently. Advantages: Increases Productivity, reduces CPU idle time. Disadvantage: Operating System is complex and difficult to operate, requires more expensive CPU.
vii) Interactive Processing: Characterized by data storage in direct access, easily accessible media and by processing that can take place immediately as transaction occur.

\section*{Elements of Data Hierarchy}

A file is a collection of records. Each record is made up of fields. The various fields consists of groups of characters. In data processing, the hierarchy of data is ordered from the smallest element to the most comprehensive i.e.
- Bit: can either be a zero or a one; the two states that define the computer memory. It's a unit of storage
- Character: the smallest element in a logical file while in a physical file it is formed by 8 bits combined together ie a byte.
- Fields: characters combine up to form afield which forms the attribute of a given entity.
- Records: related fields combine up to form a record for an entity.
- Block: in a physical file, records combine to form a block. The idea of blocks is not applicable to logical files.
- File: is a compilation of related data records maintained in some pre-arranged order ( eg an employees' file might consist of 1,000 individual employees' data records and the records might be arranged in a file by employee number).
- Database: usually consists of several related and integrated data files.
