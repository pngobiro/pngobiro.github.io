4. **Topic-by-Subtopic Tracking**:
   ```
   # Topic 1: Introduction to ICT
   MMD Lines: 125-320
   HTML File: topics/topic1-intro-ict.html

   [ ] Images properly extracted & referenced
   [ ] Equations render correctly
   [ ] Navigation links working
   [ ] Visual enhancements applied
   [ ] Accessibility checks passed
   ```

5. **Repeat Section 4 for Each Main Topic (Topics 2-11)**

6. **Cross-Topic Navigation Planning**:
   ```
   Navigation Structure:
   - Previous/Next Topic links (Implement based on final file order)
   - Topic to Subtopic relationships (Use HTML anchors/IDs)
   - Breadcrumb navigation structure (Optional, based on hierarchy)

   Cross-References:
   - (Identify any explicit "See section X.Y" references during content transfer)
   ```

7. **Issues & Resolutions Log**:
   ```
   - [TOPIC/SUBTOPIC] [DESCRIPTION] - [STATUS]
   - General: MMD Title incorrect ("estudocu") - RESOLVED (Use "ICT Notes - Introduction to the Course")
   - General: Frequent "Downloaded by..." lines need removal - PENDING (Address during content transfer)
   - General: Discrepancy between initial TOC tables and MMD content flow/numbering - RESOLVED (Follow MMD flow for HTML files, use initial TOC for index.html)
   - Topic 4/5: MMD numbering differs from initial TOC - RESOLVED (Follow MMD numbering/content for topic files)
   - Topic 11: Presentation Packages appears out of order in MMD - RESOLVED (Place as topic8.html based on MMD flow)
   - Topic 12: Emerging Trends not found as distinct section - PENDING (Check if content exists unlabelled or needs omission if truly absent)
   - General: Data Processing section present in MMD but not initial TOC - RESOLVED (Create topic11.html for it)
   ```
