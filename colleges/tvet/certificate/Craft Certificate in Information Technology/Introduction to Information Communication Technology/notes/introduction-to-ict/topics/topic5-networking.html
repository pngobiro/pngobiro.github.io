                        <p>Computer networks can be characterized by their size as well as their purpose. The size of a network can be expressed by the geographic area they occupy and the number of computers that are part of the network. Networks can cover anything from a handful of devices within a single room to millions of devices spread across the entire globe.</p>
                        <p>Some of the different networks based on size are:</p>

                        <p>In terms of purpose, many networks can be considered general purpose, which means they are used for everything from sending files to a printer to accessing the Internet. Some types of networks, however, serve a very particular purpose. Some of the different networks based on their main purpose are:</p>

                                <p>E-mail or Electronic mail is a paperless method of sending messages, notes or letters from one person to another or even many people at the same time via the Internet. E-mail is very fast compared to the normal post. Easy to manage inexpensive and saves on paper. For one to be able to communicate using e-mail, the following components are needed:</p>
                                <ol type="i" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                    <li>A computer to send and receive message</li>
                                    <li>Your e-mail address and that of the receiver</li>
                                    <li>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) company who will deliver the message to the receiver</li>
                                    <li>An e-mail program that lets you send, receive and manage your e-mail messages e.g. Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, Lotus notes, e.t.c.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>A typical e-mail message has three basic elements; header, message and signature.</p>
                                <ol type="i" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                    <li>The <strong>header</strong> appears first and typically includes the following information;<br>
                                    <strong>To.</strong> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; line; for person to receive the message (his/her email address)<br>
                                    The <strong>cc:</strong> ........... line: used by the sender to provide a list of email addresses that must receive a carbon copy of the message. Several addresses can be listed in this headerline, separated by commas. All recipients of the email message receive the To: and cc: header lines.<br>
                                    The <strong>bcc:</strong>.........line: used by the sender to provide a list of comma separated email addresses that must receive a blind carbon copy of the message. The bcc header line is not delivered to the recipients of the email message.<br>
                                    The <strong>date</strong>.<br>
                                    <strong>From</strong> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; line; the person sending the message<br>
                                    <strong>Subject</strong> &emsp;&emsp; line; a description of the message<br>
                                    The <strong>attachment</strong> line; for attachment of files</li>
                                    <li><strong>Message/letter</strong><br>Its typically short and to the point.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Signature</strong><br>This line provides additional information about the sender.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Components of an E-mail Address</strong></p>
                                <p>As in the case of normal mail system, e-mail is also based upon the concept of a recipient address. The email address provides all of the information required to get a message to the recipient from anywhere in the world. The internet uses an addressing message called Domain Name System (DNS) to assign names to people and computers. Consider the e-mail ID<br>
                                <code>benesad@yahoo.com</code><br>
                                In the example above, "benesad" is the username, which is the name of a mailbox on the destination computer, where finally the mail will be delivered. @ is a separator. yahoo is the mail server where the mailbox "benesad" exists, .com is the type of organization on net, which is hosting the mail server.<br>
                                There are six main categories;<br>
                                <strong>com</strong> Commercial institutions or organization<br>
                                <strong>edu</strong> Educational institutions<br>
                                <strong>gov</strong> Government site<br>
                                <strong>mil</strong> Military site<br>
                                <strong>net</strong> Gateways and administrative hosts<br>
                                <strong>org</strong> Private organizations</p>
                                <p><strong>The address book</strong><br>
                                E-mails usually have and address book. This is a directory of details, including e-mail addresses, for people whom you send messages (called contacts).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</strong></p>
                                <p>File Transfer Protocol, is an Internet utility software used to upload and download files. It gives access to directories or folders on remote computers and allows software, data and text files to be transferred between different kinds of computers.</p>

                            <li><strong>World Wide Web</strong><br>WWW is the acronym for the World Wide Web. It is also commonly known as 'The Web'. It is a collection of hyperlinked web pages published on the internet. This huge collection of documents is stored on computers called hosts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web site</strong><br>A collection of web pages belonging to an organization or an individual. An area on the WWW that is accessed by its own internet address.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web page</strong><br>Are documents published by organizations and individuals interested in putting themselves on the web. Web pages can include text, pictures, sound and video. Each web page has an address on the internet. This address is called a uniform resource Locator. (URL). A web site can be a collection of web pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Home page</strong><br>Is the web page loaded when internet explorer is first started i.e. when you access the web. The home page is also the first page of a company or an individual's websites on the web. The home page of a website is the introductory page for the site.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web browser:</strong><br>A program that lets you browse through (or surf) information on the web. Information on the web is structured into pages.<br>The two browsers that are popular are: Microscope Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, Morzila Firefox,</li>
                            <li><strong>Search engine:</strong><br>A computer program that is used to look for information, find specific websites on the internet. Programs that search documents for specified keywords and returns a list of the documents where the keywords were found on the internet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web address (Uniform Resource Locator: URL)</strong><br>It is a unique address or location for each page. The process of using browser to view information on Internet is known as Browsing or Surfing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internet Address/</strong><br>Just like every house, every office, every location has an address, every page on the Internet has a unique address. This address is used get the web page for user from Internet.<br>The address on the Internet is known as URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A typical Internet address or URL would look like;<br><code>http://www.nos.org/computers/internet/url.htm</code>.<br>The URL locates a particular web Page, among all the computers connected to the Internet. The URL contains the components that specify the protocol, server, and pathname of an item. Let us examine the URL given above (http://www.nos.org/computers/internet/url.htm).<br>The protocol is followed by a colon (http:), the server is preceded by two slashes (//www.nos.org), and each segment of the pathname is preceded by a single slash (/computers/internet/url.htm). A protocol is set of rules that tells the computer know how to interpret the information at that address.<br>The first component, the protocol, defines the manner for interpreting computer information. Many Internet pages use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other common Internet protocols that one might come across are FTP (File Transfer Protocol), NEWS (Usenet news groups protocol), and GOPHER (an alternative transfer protocol). Gopher protocol is mostly out of date now.<br>The second component, the server (www.nos.edu) or domain name, identifies the computer system that stores the information you seek and is always preceded by two slashes. A server is a computer that has information stored on it and sends it to the client, when a request is made. Each server on the Internet has a unique address name whose text refers to the organization maintaining the server.<br>The last component (/computers/internet/), defines the path within the Server where the requested item (url.htm) will be found. Most of the Web pages will have .htm or .html as their secondary or extension name.</li>

                        <p><strong>Intranet</strong> is a computer network that uses Internet Protocol technology to share information, or computing services within an organization.</p>
                        <p>An intranet uses network technologies as a tool to facilitate communication between people or work groups to improve the data sharing capability and overall knowledge base of an organization's employees. Sometimes, the term refers only to the organization's internal website, but may be a more extensive part of the organization's information technology infrastructure, and may be composed of multiple local area networks. Any of the well-known Internet protocols may be found in an intranet, such as HTTP (web services), SMTP (e-mail), and FTP (file transfer protocol).</p>
                        <p>While intranets are generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties.</p>
                        <p>In many organizations, intranets are protected from unauthorized external access by means of a network gateway and firewall.</p>
                        <p>An <strong>extranet</strong> is a private network that uses Internet technology to securely share part of a organization's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. An extranet can be viewed as part of a company's intranet that is extended to users outside the company.</p>
                        <p>An extranet requires security and privacy. These can include firewall server management, the issuance and use of digital certificates or similar means of user authentication, encryption of messages, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that tunnel through the public network.</p>
