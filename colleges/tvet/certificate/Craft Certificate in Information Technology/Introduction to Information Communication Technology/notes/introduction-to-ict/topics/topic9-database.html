                        <p>A DBMS is a complex software, which creates, expands & maintains the database, and it also provides the interface between the user and the data in the database.</p>
                        <p>Through the DBMS, users communicate their requirements to the database using Data Description Languages (DDL's) & Data Manipulation Languages (DML's).</p>
                        <p>In fact, the DBMS provide an interface between the user's programs and the contents of the database.</p>

                        <h4>(1). Relational database model.</h4>
                        <p>A <strong>Relational database</strong> is a set of data where all the items are related.<br>
                        The data elements in a Relational database are stored or organized in tables. A <strong>Table</strong> consists of rows & columns. Each column represents a <strong>Field</strong>, while a row represents a <strong>Record</strong>. The records are grouped under fields.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">A Relational database is flexible and easy to understand.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">A Relational database system, has the ability to quickly find & bring information stored in separate tables together using queries, forms, & reports. This means that, a data element in any one table can be related to any piece of data in another table as long as both tables share common data elements.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of Relational database systems;</p>

                            <li>Microsoft Access.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>(2).Hierarchical database model.</h4>
                        <p>It is a data structure where the data is organized like a family tree or an organization chart.<br>
                        In a Hierarchical database, the records are stored in multiple levels. Units further down the system are subordinate to the ones above.<br>
                        In other words, the database has branches made up of parent and child records. Each parent record can have multiple child records, but each child can have only one parent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Components of Data hierarchy.</strong></p>

                        <h4>(3).Network Database Model.</h4>
                        <p>A Network database model represents many-to-many relationships between data. It allows a data element or record to be related to more than one other data element or record. For example, an employee can be associated with more than one department.</p>

                        <h4>(4). Object-Oriented Model</h4>
                        <p>Object-oriented databases use small, recyclable separated piece of software called <strong>objects</strong>. The objects themselves are stored in the object-oriented database. Each object contains of two elements:</p>

                            <li>Piece of data (e.g., sound, video, text, or graphics).</li>
                            <li>Instructions, or software programs called <strong>methods</strong>, for what to do with the data.</li>

                        <p>Ms-Access provides 3 ways of creating a blank (empty) table;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Use the Table Wizard.</strong> The Wizard enables the user to choose the fields for the table from a variety of predefined tables such as Business contacts, Household inventory, or Medical records.</li>
                            <li><strong>Create a table in Design view</strong> where you can add fields, define how each field appears or handles data, and create a primary key.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enter data directly into a blank datasheet.</strong> When you save the new datasheet, Ms-Access will analyze your data and automatically assign the appropriate data type and format for each field.</li>

                        <p><strong>Datasheet view</strong> - A window that displays data from a Table, Form, or Query, in a row-andcolumn format. In Datasheet view, you can edit fields, add and delete data, and search for data.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>primary key</strong> is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. No two records in a table should have the same values in every field.</p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">FIELD PROPERTIES.</h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The table's Design view is divided into 2 parts. The lower part is used to display and assign field properties to selected fields.</p>
                        <p><strong>Field properties</strong> - a set of characteristics that provide additional control over how the data in a field is stored, entered, or displayed.</p>
                        <p>Each data type has a different set of properties.<br>
                        The different field properties include:</p>
                        <ol type="i" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>FieldSize.</strong></p>
                                <p>The FieldSize property defines/ controls the maximum no. of characters that can be entered/ stored in a Text or Number field.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Format.</strong></p>
                                <p>The Format property specifies how (the way) data is displayed in a field & printed.<br>
                                Number & Currency fields provide predefined display formats. They include Currency, Fixed, General, Percent, Scientific, General data, Medium date, Medium time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Decimal places.</strong></p>
                                <p>It is used to define the no. of decimal places in values. This option is used on fields that already have the Fixed format such as in Number and Currency fields.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Default value.</strong></p>
                                <p>It allows you to define a value that will automatically be inserted into the field as you add new records. It is used in Text and Memo fields.<br>
                                For example, to insert the current date in the Admission date field use "Date ()".<br>
                                The default value affects only new records inserted.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p><strong>Validation Rule.</strong></p>
                                <p>It allows you to create an expression or a formula that will test data when being entered into the field.<br>
                                It automatically rejects faulty/flawed entries, e.g., entering very large or very small figures in the Age or Salary fields.</p>

                                Examples of data include:<br>
                                <strong>0#/0#/0#</strong> - this forces a 2-digits entries for the year, month and date in a date field.<br>
                                <strong>A</strong> - Allows letters or digits into a field, but an entry is required.<br>
                                <strong>9</strong> - Allows letters or digits in a field, but no entry is required.<br>
                                <strong>000000</strong> - Allows a 6-digit number (not more or less than that).<br>
                                <strong>999999</strong> - Allows 6 or less digits.<br>
                                <strong>AAAAA</strong> - only 5 characters are to be entered.<br>
                                <strong>&gt;</strong> - converts the field entry to Uppercase.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Applies to Text and Memo field data types.<br>
                                Setting the value in Allow Zero Length property to YES and the Required property YES, the field must contain at least one character.</p>

                                They provide a neat and descriptive name since the fieldname should be kept small for practical use.</p>

                                <p>[Yes (Duplicates OK)] - Gives sorted, indexed field and can allow data duplicates.<br>
                                [Yes (No duplicates)] - Gives sorted, indexed field but cannot allow data duplicates.<br>

                        <p><strong>Primary key</strong> is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a database table.<br>
                        Examples of key fields include - Identification numbers, Registration numbers, User codes, etc.<br>
                        Using a Primary key is a way of telling Ms-Access to:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">Make sure no two records have the same value within that field.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">Keep records sorted by the entries of the Primary key fields.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are 3 kinds of primary keys that can be defined in Ms-Access:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>AutoNumber primary keys.</strong></p>
                                <p>An AutoNumber field can be set to automatically enter a sequential no. as each record is added to the table.<br>
                                Choosing an AutoNumber field as the primary key for a table is the simplest way to create a primary key.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Single-field primary keys.</strong></p>
                                <p>If you have a field that contains unique values such as ID numbers, you can select that field as the primary key. You can specify a primary key for a field that already contains data as long as that field does not contain duplicate values or Null values.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Multiple-field primary keys.</strong></p>
                                <p>In situations where you cannot guarantee the uniqueness of any single field, you can choose two or more fields as the primary key.<br>
                                This commonly arises in situations where a table is used to relate two other tables in a many-to-many relationship.</p>

                        Defining relationships is a way of telling Ms-Access how to bring information/ data from multiple tables back together again in a query, form, or report.</p>
                        <p>After defining the relationship, you can create queries, forms, and reports to display information from several tables at once.</p>

                        <p>In order to relate two tables, each table should include a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies each record stored in the table. Such a field is called the <strong>Primary key</strong> of the table.</p>
                        <p>The Primary key field relates two tables so that Ms-Access can bring together the data from the two tables for viewing, editing, or printing.<br>
                        In one table, the field is a Primary key that you set in table Design view. That same field also exists in the related table as a <strong>Foreign key</strong>.</p>

                        <p>A <strong>Query</strong> is a question about the data stored in your tables, or a request to perform an action on the data.</p>
                        <p>You use queries to view, change, and analyze data in different ways.<br>
                        A query can find & bring together data that meets conditions that you specify from multiple tables. It can also serve as the source of data for a Form, or a Report.<br>
                        A query can also update or delete multiple records at the same time, and perform predefined or custom calculations on your data.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 major types of queries in Microsoft Access.</p>

                                <p>A <strong>Select query</strong> is a query that asks a question about the data stored in your tables and returns a result set in the form of a datasheet-without changing the data.</p>
                                <p><strong>Creating a Select query.</strong><br>
                                You can create a query with a wizard or from scratch in Query Design view.<br>
                                In Design view, you specify the data you want to work with by adding the tables or queries that contain the data, and then by filling in the Design grid.</p>

                                <p>A <strong>Parameter query</strong> is a query that when run displays its own dialog box prompting you for information, such as criteria for retrieving records or a value you want to insert in a field.<br>
                                You can design the query to prompt you for more than one piece of information;<br>
                                For example,</p>
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">You can design it to prompt you for two dates. Ms-Access can then retrieve all records that fall between those two dates.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">You can create a monthly earnings report based on a parameter query. When you print the report, Ms-Access displays a dialog box asking for the month that you want the report to cover. When you enter a month, Ms-Access prints the appropriate report.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>CROSSTAB QUERIES.</strong></p>
                                <p>A <strong>Crosstab query</strong> is a query that calculates a Sum, Average, Count, or other type of total on records, and then groups the result by two types of information - one down the left side of the datasheet and the other across the top.<br>
                                Use Crosstab queries to calculate and restructure your data for easy analysis.<br>
                                <strong>Note.</strong> A Crosstab query displays the same information, but groups it both horizontally and <em>(rest of sentence missing in source)</em></p>

                        <p>A <strong>Report</strong> is an Access database object that prints information formatted and organized according to your specifications.<br>
                        To analyze your data or present it a certain way in print, create a report. For example, you might print one report that groups data and calculates totals, and another report with different data formatted for printing mailing labels.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <p>A report is an effective way to present your data in a printed format. Because you have control over the size and appearance of everything on a report, you can display the information the way you want to see it.<br>
                        Most reports are bound to one or more table and query in the database. A report's record source refers to the fields in the underlying tables and queries. A report need not contain all the fields from each of the tables or queries that it is based on.<br>
                        A bound report gets its data from its underlying record source. Other information on the form, such as the title, date, and page number, is stored in the report's design.<br>
                        You create the link between a report and its record source by using graphical objects called controls. Controls can be text boxes that display names and numbers, labels that display titles, or decorative lines that graphically organize the data and make the report more attractive.</p>
