                        <p><strong>Data Security</strong> is the practice of keeping data protected from corruption and unauthorized access. It involves the use of various methods to make sure that data is correct, kept confidential and is safe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data privacy</strong> refers to the right of individuals or organizations to deny or restrict the collection and use of information about them. It requires system managers to reduce unauthorized access into their systems by building physical arrangements and software checks.<br>
                        Data is the raw form of information stored as columns and rows in our databases, network servers and personal computers. This may be a wide range of information from personal files and intellectual property to market analytics and details intended to top secret. E.g. bank account details.</p>

                                <p>Short for malicious software.<br>
                                Is software used or created to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.</p>
                                <p>'Malware' is a general term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile, intrusive, or annoying software<br>
                                Malware is malicious software that is intended to take control, damage, or corrupt computer systems.<br>
                                <strong>Types of Malware:</strong><br>
                                Viruses, Trojan horses, Worms, Spyware, Zombie, Phishing, Spam, Adware, Ransomware, Backdoors, Loggers</p>
                                <p><strong>Viruses:</strong> Program that is designed to spread from one computer to another and to interfere with computer operation. Viruses cannot replicate independently; they need to be transferred to another computer and run by a user. They can be transferred by various means, such as using deception to convince the user that the file they are opening is benign. Examples of computer viruses are: Macro virus, Boot virus, Logic Bomb virus, Directory virus.</p>
                                <p><strong>Worms:</strong> Software that infects a computer and then replicates itself from system to system on its own without the help of a host file. The main feature that separates worms from viruses is that worms are self-replicating.</p>
                                <p><strong>Trojan horses:</strong> Are applications which appear to be useful, legitimate applications, but run malicious, hidden code. The application may appear to perform tasks, such as scanning for spyware, but actually steal personal data from your system. Executing Trojans may result in changing desktop wallpaper, creating pop-ups, or even deleting files. One of their most popular uses is creating backdoors to allow malicious users to gain access to files and information. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans cannot infect other systems.</p>
                                <h4 class="sub-heading">Phishing</h4>
                                <p>while not actually malware, phishing has recently become a real security concern. Users are directed to a seemingly trustworthy website and defrauded into giving up personal information, such as credit card details, passwords, etc.</p>
                                <p><strong>Spyware:</strong> Spyware is a type of malware installed on computers that collects information about users without their knowledge. The presence of spyware is typically hidden from the user and can be difficult to detect. Spyware programs lurk on your computer to steal important information, like your passwords and logins and other personal identification information and then send it off to someone else.</p>
                                <p><strong>Adware</strong> - A type of malware that displays advertisements on your computer and collects data about your browsing habits without your consent.</p>
                                <p><strong>Keylogger</strong> - Malicious software that tracks the keystrokes on a computer and transmits the data to another location so it can be used to detect usernames and passwords that are typed on a computer</p>
                                <p>Some measures taken to protect computer programs and offer data security are;</p>
