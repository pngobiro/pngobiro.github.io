                                Magnetic drums was used as primary memory.<br>
                                Punch card, paper tape was for secondary storage. Punched card, printing devices were used for input/output operations and store the result.<br>
                                It occupies very large space, slow processing, inefficient and unreliable due to low accuracy.<br>
                                Power consumption was very high and it generated much heat.<br>
                                It could only perform straight forward simple numerical calculation.<br>
                                Computer used to be much expensive.<br>
                                Example of Computers were ENIAC and UNIVAC</p>

                                <p>The computers relied on transistors (signal Bridges) and other solid state devices that replaced vacuum tubes in the computer circuitry. Transistors were more reliable and more stable than vacuum tubes; they generated less heat and consumed less power. Magnetic cores were used in the main memory.<br>
                                Second generation computer replaced machine language with assembly language, allowing abbreviated programming codes to replace long, difficult binary codes.<br>
                                Assembly language and machines independent language such as COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) and FORTRAN (Formula Translation) were introduced<br>
                                Magnetic drum and magnetic tape were used as secondary memory.</p>

                                <p>The third generation computers used integrated circuits(IC's) which were made by combining several transistors together. IC is a complete electronic circuit that packages transistors and other electronic components on a small silicon chip.<br>

                                High-level languages like BASIC are used to develop programs.<br>
                                Semiconductor memory like RAM and ROM were used as primary memory.<br>
                                Monitor and keyboard were introduced for data input and output respectively.</p>

                        <p>The personal computer, or PC, is designed to be used by one person at a time. Actual personal computers can be generally classified by size and chassis / case. The chassis or case is the metal frame that serves as the structural support for electronic components. Every computer system requires at least one chassis to house the circuit boards and wiring. There are two basic flavors of chassis designs-desktop models and tower models-but there are many variations on these two basic types. Then come the portable computers that are computers small enough to carry. Portable computers include notebook and tablets, hand-held computers, palmtops, and PDAs.</p>
