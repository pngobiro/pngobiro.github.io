                                <p>A mother board usually has slots for plugging in specialized processor chips- two in particular you may encounter are math and graphics co-processor chips. A math processor helps programs using a lot of mathematical equations to run faster. A graphic processor chip enhances the performance of programs with lots of graphics and helps to create complex screen displays.</p>

                                <p>Made up of RAM and ROM chips. A chip is a small piece of silicon on which most integrated circuits are implemented.<br>
                                ROM Chips have programs built into them at the factory. The content of ROM cannot be changed by the user. ROM chips contain special instructions for detailed computer operations e.g. ROM instructions may start the computer, give keyboard keys their special control capabilities and put characters on the screen. Variations of ROM chips are; PROMonce written cannot be changed and EPROM-can be erased with a special ultraviolet light and new instructions written on it.<br>
                                RAM can be added on the computer using memory expansion boards on the mother board.</p>

                                <p>Connects parts of the CPU to each other. It also links the CPU with other important hardware. A bus is a data roadway / pathway along which bits (electronic signals) travel. The greater the capacity of a bus, the more powerful and faster the operation or a computer. There are several types of bus e.g. data bus, address bus and control bus.</p>

                        <p><strong>NB:</strong> The CPU communicates with the memory and input/output devices using buses. There are three types of buses:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Address bus:</strong> Many components are connected to one another through buses. Each component is assigned a unique ID. This ID is called the address of that component. If a component wants to communicate with another component, it uses address bus to specify the address of that component.<br>The address bus is a unidirectional bus. It can carry information only in one direction. It carries physical address of devices from microprocessor to the main memory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> Carries Data between processor and the memory. They are bi-directional buses (It means that: CPU can read data from memory using these lines also the CPU can write data to memory locations using these lines). The number of lines in data bus affects the speed of data transfer between different components. The data bus consists of 8, 16, 32, or 64 lines. A 64-line data bus can transfer 64 bits of data at one time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control Bus:</strong> used to transmit different commands or control signals from one component to another component. They are unidirectional buses that carry command signals from the microprocessor.</li>

                        <p>The CPU's Processing Speed depends on a variety of factors including</p>
                        <ol type="i" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>The size of circuitry paths, or buses that interconnect microprocessor components;</li>
                            <li>The capacity of registers,</li>
                            <li>The system clock speed,</li>
                            <li>The size of Cache Memory (an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed)</li>

                        <p>The system clock controls how faster all the operations within a computer takes place. It uses fixed vibrations from a quartz crystal to deliver a steady stream of pulses to CPU. The faster the clock the more instructions the CPU can execute. The clock speed is measured in Hertz where 1 Hz equals 1 cycle (tick) per second. <span class="math-inline">\(1,000 \mathrm{~Hz}=1 \mathrm{KHz}, 1,000 \mathrm{KHz}=1 \mathrm{MHz}, 1,000 \mathrm{MHz}=1 \mathrm{GHz}, 1,000 \mathrm{GHz}=1 \mathrm{THz}\)</span>, e.t.c. some of the intel processors are core i3, i5, i7 and i9.</p>

                        <p>It stores data that is currently being worked on. It is accessible by the CPU directly without going through any other input. This memory has fast access time by the CPU, its more expensive and usually of small quantities.</p>

                                <p>RAM is the working memory of computer and thus holds data for processing, instructions for processing the data and processed data (information) waiting to be sent to output device or secondary storage. The more amount of RAM you have, the faster your computer operates and the better your software performs.<br>
                                RAM is volatile; losing the stored information in an event of power loss, and quite expensive.<br>
                                It is called random access because the processor or computer can access any location in memory in any order as contrasted with sequential access devices which must be accessed in order.<br>
                                There are 2 basic types; Static RAM and Dynamic RAM</p>

                                <p><strong>Read Only Memory</strong></p>
                                <p>Is also random access but only for reads, once data has been written onto a ROM chip, it cannot be removed and can only be read.<br>
                                It refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics. Most personal computers have a small amount of ROM (a few thousand bytes).<br>
                                Retains its contents even when the computer is turned off and is therefore referred to as being nonvolatile.</p>

                        <p>All electronic devices are known to communicate in two ways i.e. binary mode of communication. An example is a bulb which can either be "ON" or "OFF". Computers given the fact that they are made of electronic components, they therefore have a binary language. The binary digits 1 and 0 constitute computer language which either represents "ON" or "OFF". A group of 8 bits is used to code one human character in the computer. This is called a byte. i.e. 1 or 0 is called a bit, 8 bits = a byte = 1 human character, 1024 bytes = 1 Kilobyte, <span class="math-inline">\(1024 \mathrm{~KB}=1\)</span> Mega Byte, <span class="math-inline">\(1024 \mathrm{MB}=1\)</span> Giga byte, <span class="math-inline">\(1024 \mathrm{~GB}=1\)</span> Terabyte, 1024TB = 1 Petabyte, etc.</p>
                        <p>The byte is a standard unit for measuring information amount stored in a computer.</p>

                                <p>It's a flat plastic ribbon on which data can be stored using a magnetic process. Data is stored as magnetic spots arranged in columns on the magnetic tape. Magnetic tapes are sequential access devices.</p>

                                <p><strong>Hard disk</strong></p>
                                <p>Thin but rigid metal plate covered with a substance that allows data to be held in the form of magnetized spots. The disk is tightly sealed within an enclosed hard disk drive to prevent any foreign matter from getting inside. Data is recorded on both sides of the platter. In micro computers are located inside the system unit. The advantage of a hard disk over a floppy disk is that the hard disk allows a faster access to data than floppy disks because it spins faster than floppy disks. Hard disk have high data storage capacity than the floppy disks. The limitation of hard disk to floppy disk is that if any foreign matters into the disk drive the read/write head comes into contact with the disk and thus causing a head crash. We have two types of hard disks: internal hard disk and external hard disks</p>

                                <p><strong>Optical Disks</strong></p>
                                <p>Used for storing large quantities of data like videos. In optical technology, a laser beam alters the surface of a plastic disk to represent data. To read the data, a laser scans the areas and sends the data to a computer chip for conversion.</p>
                                <p>Unlike hard disks and floppy disks, which use magnetic spots to represent 1's and 0's, optical disks use laser beam of light. On a CD/DVD 1's and 0's are represented by flat areas and bumpy areas called pits on its bottom surface. The CD/DVD is read by a laser that projects a tiny beam of light on these areas. The amount of reflected light determines whether the area represents 1 or 0.</p>
                                <p>Optical disks are of different types:</p>
                                <ol type="i" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                    <li><strong>CD - ROM:</strong> Compact disk read only Memory<br>CD-ROM is a read-only disc which cannot be written on or erased by the user. The discs are used to distribute software and any other data that is stored permanently.</li>
                                    <li><strong>CD - R:</strong> Compact Disk Recordable<br>A CD format that allows users to write data only once.</li>
                                    <li><strong>CD-RW:</strong> Compact Disk Rewritable/ Erasable Optical Disk<br>Allows users to record and erase data so that the disk can be used over and over again</li>
                                    <li><strong>DVD:</strong> Digital Video/Versatile Disk<br>High density optical disks which are read and written by the laser beam. DVD's store much more data than standard CD's. The surface of a DVD contains microscopic pits which are smaller and closer to one together than those on a CD allowing for more information to be represented.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Blu-ray</strong><br>Blu-ray is a high-definition optical format that offer 25 GB per layer with up to two layers per disc. Blu-ray discs have a protective coating that reduces the number of scratches and makes the disc durable.</li>

                                <p><strong>Solid-state storage technology</strong></p>
                                <p>A Solid State storage is a type of computer storage media made from silicon microchips. It stores data electronically instead of magnetically or optically. It has no moving parts thus uses much less power and provides better performance than a hard disk drive in an existing computer system. It is also used for new computer or embedded system designs which require smaller physical size, removability, lower power, higher performance and/or a lower price.<br>
                                Solid State Storage can be found in three form factors: Solid State Drives, Solid State Cards, and Solid State Modules</p>
                                <p>Example of devices; USB flash drive, Flash memory and micro flash memory cards, Solid state drive (SSD)</p>
