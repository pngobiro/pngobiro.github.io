                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Data Processing has come into being to meet an increasing need for information under increasingly complex conditions. Eg it can assist in handling the paperwork for an ever increasing volume of data.</p>
                        <p>Through elimination of clerical operations, accuracy is ensured</p>
                        <p>Data processing can meet a company's needs, both financial and non-financial. It meets the financial needs by helping the company to reduce costs through maintaining the records nicely and reducing inventory and overhead costs. It meets non-financial needs e.g. by improving company's competitive position allowing for greater flexibility and providing the potential for rapid expansion.</p>

Eg payroll preparation. One the processing of a given batch is started, there is no interractions between the operator (user) and the batch operating system.</p>
