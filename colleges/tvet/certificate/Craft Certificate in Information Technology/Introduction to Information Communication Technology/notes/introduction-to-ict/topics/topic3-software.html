                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Functions of the operating system</h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The general functions of the operating system are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Processor Management.</strong></p>
                                <p>The processor is a scarce resource. It executes tasks called Processes which are further broken into lightweight tasks called Threads.</p>
                                <p>A Multi-tasking computer system can run several applications simultaneously. At times, several tasks may require processing, hence creating competition. However, the CPU can only execute one program at any one time.<br>
                                Therefore, access to the CPU must be carefully controlled & monitored. The OS must decide, which program will be allowed into the CPU, and for how long.</p>
                                <p>To do this, the OS arranges the tasks according to priority and has the ability to stop a particular task to allow the processor to service another task.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Memory allocation & loading of programs.</strong></p>
                                <p>Programs must be loaded into memory (RAM) before they can be executed, and moved out of memory when they are no longer required. Therefore, before processing starts, the OS ensures that the programs are transferred into the available memory location in the Main memory from the secondary storage, e.g. a hard disk.</p>
                                <p>At any one given time, a number of tasks may require the memory so that they can be accessed & processed by the computer. The computer memory is a scarce resource, and therefore, the OS must determine which task will remain in memory awaiting for execution and which one will be sent back to secondary storage to wait.</p>
                                <p>The OS keeps track of what parts of memory are in use and by which program, and what parts are free.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Input/output devices management.</strong></p>
                                <p>Every computer has many Input & Output (I/O) devices. The OS controls the input from & output to the various devices. It also tries to monitor the state of each I/O device and signals any faults detected.<br>
                                During the course of their execution, programs will request the use of an Input or Output device. In a multi-user system, conflicts are likely to occur when one program requests a device that is being used by another program. Therefore, the OS will control allocation of I/O devices and attempt to resolve any conflicts that arise.<br>
                                Because most input/output devices are slower than the processor, the OS has to control the flow of data from the time of input to the time the user receives it as information. It ensures that the right data reaches the processor at the right time.<br>
                                The OS also defines the various input/output ports found on the computer, e.g., printer port.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Management of secondary storage devices.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS manages the storage & retrieval of data on secondary storage devices. It also utilizes the free space on hard disks to enhance the performance of the computer by temporarily holding tasks on it that were in RAM ready for processing but have to wait for sometime.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>File management.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS is concerned with the logical organization of the information (the File System) and provides a means through which files can be sorted, retrieved & shared.</p>
                                <p>It also provides a means of protecting data files & programs against unauthorized access and corruption.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Job scheduling.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS arranges & loads programs in order to provide a continuous sequence of processing & also provide the appropriate responses to events.</p>
                                <p>The processor can handle only one task at a time. Therefore, in a situation where more than one application program is occupying the main storage, the OS has to determine which task will be processed first and ensures that the one that is currently being processed is closely monitored to avoid wasting time in the processor.</p>
                                <p>The jobs are allocated priorities so as to ensure that there is continuous processing until all the jobs within the memory are executed. This ensures that the CPU does not remain idle at any given instance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Job sequencing.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS keeps a list of jobs/tasks currently being run and monitors them as they move in & out of the processor. It also arranges them in a particular order to make it easy for the processor to execute them and to know how & when to fetch instructions & data for each task.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Resource control and allocation.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS controls the selection & operation of hardware devices used for input, output and storage.</p>
                                <p>The OS determines which task uses a particular resource and at what time. To do this, it gives each resource a unique identification number called an Interrupt number so that, when two tasks request to use a resource at the same time, the one with higher priority interrupt is granted control.</p>
                                <p>This prevents an undesirable situation called deadlock that occurs when a particular task holds a needed resource & refuses to release it for use by other tasks.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Error reporting & correction routines.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS has many ways of reporting to the user of any errors that occur during program execution. It does this by monitoring the status of the computer system & performing error checks on both hardware and software.</p>
                                <p>When the user makes an error, the OS through the Kernel determines the cause of the error, and prints diagnostic messages on the screen suggesting appropriate routines of how the error can be corrected.</p>
                                <p>In case of a fatal error that cannot be corrected, the program will be suspended permanently. E.g., the user program will prematurely terminate when it encounters an illegal operation, such as, dividing a no. by 0 or if it attempts to read a data file that had not been opened.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Interrupt handling.</strong></p>
                                <p>An Interrupt is a break from the normal sequential processing of instructions in a program.<br>
                                Each hardware device communicates to the processor using a special number called the Interrupt Request number (IRQ). Therefore, when an interrupt occurs, control is passed to the Kernel, which determines the cause of the interrupt. The processor stops executing the current program to wait for the corrective response of the user. Control is returned to the program that was interrupted once corrective action has been taken.</p>
                                <p>Some causes of Interrupt.</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>An Interrupt caused by Power failure.<br>The Kernel saves vital information using the dying power supply so that it can be restarted when power is returned.</li>
                                    <li>Arithmetic or logic errors.<br>When the ALU detects that an error has occurred, (e.g., the output may be requested to a non-existent device) it generates a signal that causes an interrupt. Control is transferred to the Kernel, which indicates the appropriate error correction routines.</li>
                                    <li>Hardware malfunction, e.g. parity errors.<br>The I/O control for each device & its associated hardware normally takes care of parity checking. If a parity error is detected, the Kernel is notified by an interrupt.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Device driver - a software that the OS uses to control a specific piece of hardware.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Interfaces the user to the system's hardware.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS provides quick means of communication between the computer user & its programs.<br>
                                The user requests the services of the OS by use of commands & the OS communicates the messages regarding the processing to the user through, either the screen or printer. Thus, a form of 'conversation' is established between the OS & the computer user.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Logging & Accounting.</strong></p>
                                <p>The OS keeps records (internal logs) on how the computer's resources, e.g., CPU time, memory usage, & the peripherals are being used. It also keeps a complete record of all that happens during processing (usually in the form of a printed log).</p>

                            <li><strong>Multi-User/Multitasking Operating System</strong><br>Designed to handle more than one user at a time a phenomenon called MultiProgramming. Examples of multi-user operating systems include UNIX, Linux, and Windows NT/200/2003</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Type of processing</h4>
                        <p>The basic types of processing modes are;</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Batch processing (Offline Processing):</strong>- this is a processing mode whereby the transactions are accumulated over a period of time and then processed at a pre-specified time to produce a batch of output.</li>
                            <li><strong>Online Processing:</strong> In this processing mode, data is collected, transmitted to the computer over some form of a network and processed immediately it is received. Example: When booking a seat on an airline, the seat is booked immediately. This is to avoid problems of double-booking. Other example of online processing is when playing computer games online</li>
                            <li><strong>Real-time Processing-</strong><br>In real time processing the computer processes the incoming data as soon as it occurs, updates the transaction file and gives an immediate response that would affect the events as they happen.<br>Used mostly in process control.<br>There is no much difference with online processing however with real-time processing, the outcome of the processing is required immediately to influence decision making and not necessarily through online means but can be within a machine.<br>Example: in nuclear power stations, a certain level of temperature is required to be maintained for effective disintegration of atoms. If the temperatures are not controlled, the system may cause an emergency situation- like in increase or decrease in slight temperature fluctuations, therefore computers are used to control the air conditioning systems at the plant because they are programmed to provide instant answers upon a slight change in temperature has occurred- that is what we call real-time processing</li>
                            <li><strong>Interactive processing-</strong> this is where the operating system relies on a lot of input from the user. In the interactive approach to hardware system design the data is processed individually and continuously as transactions take place and output is generated instantly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time Sharing Processing:</strong> a processing mode in which case the central processing unit serves two or more users with different processing requirements (tasks). Processor's time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing. The central computer is therefore, available to a variety of users, connected to the central computer via communications links, who may wish to process their data and receive information. The computer works upon the user request (tasks) and the results are communicated back to the workstation via communication links.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distributed Processing:-</strong><br>These points to dividing (distributing) processing tasks to two or more computers that are located on physically separate sites but connected by data transmission media; there may be a central computer that receives input from the remote computers (terminals), processes the data and updates the master file. If required, the output can be communicated back to the remote terminals.<br>Example: When you withdraw money from a bank, your records are transacted and updated in the main server computer which will also update client computers across the bank branches divide.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Interface</h4>
                        <p>This is the communication point between the computer and the computer system. It is the user controllable part of the operating system that allows the user to communicate or interact with it.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Command line system:</strong> Are those that require the user to type a command on a command line. Example is DOS Operating System</li>
                            <li><strong>Menu Driven Operating System:</strong> here the interface is made up of different types of menus. The simplest menu provides the user with a list of program commands displayed on-screen and a simple means of selecting between them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Graphical User Interface Operating System:</strong> Is the one which the commands appear like small pictures on the screen called icons. A command is issued by pointing an arrow to the icon using a pointing device like a mouse and then pressing the select button on the device. Example includes Windows XP, Windows Vista, Apple Macintosh, UNIX, Linux, e.t.c.</li>

                        <p>A program is a set of instructions that the computer can understand. A computer program is written using a programming language that must be translated by a language translator into computers own machine language before they can be processed by the CPU. Programming language translators are known by a variety of names i.e.</p>

                            <li>An <strong>assembler</strong>. A program that translates the symbolic instructions written in assembly language into machine language instructions.</li>

                                <p><strong>The First Generation Programming Languages/ Machine languages</strong></p>
                                <p>These are programming languages understood directly by the computer. They allow people to construct letters, numbers, punctuations and other characters using a two-state system i.e. 1's and 0's. Data represented in 1's and 0's is said to be written in machine language. The language is hard for human beings to use and understand e.g. 11100111. They vary according to the make of the computer</p>
                            </li>

                                <p><strong>The second generation Programming Languages/ Assembly Languages</strong></p>
                                <p>A programming language that consists of instructions that are mnemonic codes for corresponding machine language instructions. Have advantage over the 1's and 0's of machine language because they use abbreviations or mnemonics e.g. ADD for addition, SUB for subtraction, e.t.c. They need an assembler for them to be translated to machine language. They are easier for human beings to remember compared to 1<sup>st</sup> generation, but they are still pretty thus considered low level languages. 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation languages are low level languages. Assembly languages also vary from the computer to the computer.</p>

                                <p><strong>High Level /Procedural Programming Languages/ third generation programming languages</strong></p>
                                <p>They are English like programming languages developed by the programmer in mind rather than the computer. They have simple instructions similar to English language that make it easy for human beings to understand, use and correct errors. Examples of high level programming languages are: BASIC, PASCAL, COBOL, C, and FORTRAN.<br>
                                They are called procedural because they are designed to express the logic- the procedures that can solve general problems. They are usually translated to machine language using translators like a compiler and an interpreter.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Very High Level Programming Languages/ Problem Oriented Languages</strong></p>
                                <p>Problem-oriented language is computer programming language designed to handle a particular class of problem. For example, COBOL was designed for business, FORTRAN for scientific and GPSS for simulation.<br>
                                Third Generation programming languages require training in computer programming, but very high level programming languages require little special training on the part of the user. Unlike 3rd generation languages 4<sup>th</sup> generation languages are designed to solve specific problems. This group includes query languages and application generators</p>

                                <p>5GL's involve a computer which responds directly to spoken or written instructions or English language commands. 5 GL's are typically used in the artificial Intelligence (AI) Applications.
