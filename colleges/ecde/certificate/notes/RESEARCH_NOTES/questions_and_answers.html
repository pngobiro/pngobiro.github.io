</ol>
</li>
<li>Differentiate between research design and research methodology.
<ol>
<li>Research design- it is a plan that guides the researcher in making decisions concerning when and how often to collect data, what data to gather, and from whom and where.</li>
<li>Research methodology- it deals with how the research is to be carried out.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Briefly explain the different types of research;
<ol>
<li>Experiment research- it refers to the research world, which is seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelt and felt. It involves an experiment setting where variables under study are isolated in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Basic research- it is a kind of research that has no immediate application or use at the time of conducting research, its findings may be used in the near future.</li>
<li>Action research- it is a type of research that is action oriented, it is conducted with the aim of making improvements.</li>
<li>Applied research- it is research whose findings have direct applications to the concerned people and their problems. It is designed to help solve particular existing problems rather than to acquire knowledge for knowledge sake.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>List the criteria used to identify research topics and studies in ECDE.
<ol>
<li>Teaching experience of a teacher and other educationists since they encounter issues pertaining to learning, parent involvement that require investigation.</li>

<li>It is less demanding in nature.</li>
<li>Through observation one can identify other problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Briefly give the considerartions that an ECDE teacher trainee should make when undertaking preparations for data collection for research.
<ul>
<li>The researcher should acquire authorization from relevant bodies allowing him/her to collect data</li>
<li>The respondent should be fully informed about what is expected from them and given freedom to choose either to participate or not</li>
<li>The researcher should treat the information received from respondents with utmost confidentiality.</li>
<li>In case the responses are anxiety provoking the respondents has a right to be debriefed.</li>
<li>The researcher should be honest and often with respondents and other researchers.</li>
<li>The researcher should e3nsure that subjects are protected both psychologically and physically.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>What is the meaning of data analysis- it is the systematic process of examining information in a survey/ experiment and making deduction from it.</li>
<li>The table below gives attendance of male and female participants in a children sensitization programme.
<pre><code>
      days  | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed
      ----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
      Male  | 22 | 28 | 30 | 22 | 55 | 30 | 33 | 22 | 40 | 37
      female | 36 | 38 | 39 | 42 | 45 | 50 | 50 | 55 | 55 | 58
      </code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the mean of male attendance during the programme
<p>Mean= sum of male participants / number of days</p>
<p>Mean = (22+28+30+22+55+30+33+22+40+37) / 10</p>
<p>Mean = 289 / 10 = 28.9 ~ 29</p>
</li>
<li>What is the mode of male participants in the sensitization programme= 22</li>
<li>Calculate the median for the female participants
<p>36,38,39,42,45,50,50,55,55,58</p>
<p>The data is even hence median is between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> numbers.</p>
<p>n/2 = 10/2 = 5 and n/2 + 1 = 5 + 1</p>
<p>=5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> (count in the data for 5<sup>th</sup> number= 45 and 6<sup>th</sup> = 50 after organizing the data in ascending order)</p>
<p>(45+50) / 2</p>
<p>95 / 2 = 47.5</p>
</li>
<li>Give reasons for the pattern of participation observed from the data
<ul>
<li>Women are more involved in child rearing hence high level of participation.</li>
<li>Men have given up on their roles with regards to children</li>
<li>Traditionally women are left to handle issues related to do with children.</li>
<li>More men than women are in formal employment hence tied in their places of work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
