<div class="exe-text"><h3>Research proposal</h3>
<p>This is the overview of the intended research describing the proposed presentation the researcher undergoes while conducting the study.</p>
<p>A research proposal has 3 main chapters;</p>
<ol>
<li>Giving the background of the study</li>
<li>Literature review</li>
<li>Methodology.</li>
</ol>
<p>There has been no agreed format for research proposal. This is because of different research projects for different organizations,institutions and disciplines. However there are some agreed components in all research proposals.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER ONE: introduction</h3>
<p>It provides the basis for the study and has the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction or study background/background information;
<ul>
<li>Gives detailed background information to the study.</li>
<li>Introduces the reader to the foundations of the research topicand issues of the study(highlights specifically the historical development of the study issues and its relevance in current study)</li>
<li>Should highlight the sociological and educational implications of the study.</li>
<li>Should convince the reader on the need for research study</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statement of the problem;
<ul>
<li>It is a stamen of research gap that the study is addressing.</li>
<li>It is usually based on what sees as the issues that are important but which other researchers have not addressed.</li>
<li>It is explained in two or three paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The purpose of the study;
<ul>
<li>Explains what the research will achieve once completed.</li>
<li>The general statements indicate what will specifically be investigated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Objectives and research questions
<ul>
<li>Objectives provide specific aims of the study. They are closely related to research questions since research questions are derived from the objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assumptions of the study;
<ul>
<li>A study assumption is a belief which is presumesd to be true and is a necessary basis for the study.</li>
<li>Incase assumption is untrue the research will need to do adjustments to the assumption provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scope and limitations;
<ul>
<li>Scope refers to extent of geographical, social and conceptual coverage in the study.</li>
<li>Limitations are hindrances or anticipated constraints that determine the actual coverage or extent of the study e.g resources(time, funds).</li>
<li>They should be well defined because they set the boundaries of the study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definition of terms;
<ul>
<li>Manipulates conventional terms to fit the study objectives.</li>
<li>Meaning of a term should be directly related to the study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>CHAPTER TWO: literature review</h3>
<p>It is a existing literature on the topic under study. It shows what previous research says concerning the topic or issues under study. It requires extensive study to help the researcher identify the research gaps.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER THREE: Methodology</h3>
<p>This chapter describes the research plan. It defines the basic methodological details to be used in the study. It outlines;</p>
<ul>
<li>Research design to be employed in the study e.g. survey method, case study.</li>
<li>The location of the study and reason for the choice.</li>
<li>Study population.</li>
<li>Sampling techniques used e.g. random, stratified.</li>
<li>Sample and sampling procedures.</li>
<li>Research instruments used</li>
<li>Data collection procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CHAPTER FOUR: data analysis and presentation.</h3>
<p>This is where data is interpreted, analysed and synthesized for other readers to understand and comprehend. Presentation of the final analysed and interpreted work is also discussed at this point of the research.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER FIVE: Summary, conclusions and recommendations</h3>
<p>Main features of the research are summarized and conclusions made according to the findings. The researcher may also give a personal opinion at this point. A researcher will always recommend to those coming after them in areas for future study or action plans.</p>
<h3>Research Report</h3>
<p>It provides information about the problem investigated, method of investigation and the findings, conclusions and recommendations. Reported speech is used and verbs are in the past tense.</p>
<h3>Components of a research report</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cover page; gives the title of the research proposal, students name, institution of study, supervisors name and date of presenting the research.</li>
<li>Dedication-it is made to people the researcher consider dear to them for certain reasons.</li>
<li>Declaration of research as students own work, also contains supervisors name.</li>
<li>Acknowledgement page, where researcher acknowledges the participation and contribution of others towards the success of the research.</li>
<li>Abstract or executive summary- gives summary of the research work.</li>
<li>Table of contents- it is a list of guides to show where specific information can be found in the research paper.</li>
<li>List of abbreviations and acronyms- are used when words are repeated in the study.</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Literature review</li>
<li>Methodology</li>
<li>Results and discussions (findings) summary, conclusions and recommendations.</li>
<li>References &amp; Bibliography- reference gives credit of materials used for the research. The following is the acceptable way of writing a reference; name of the author, year of publication, title of the material, book, journal., place of publication, publisher. Bibliography on the other end guides the readers of other similar works that may have informed the work. They have not been cited but can enrich the proposal if read.</li>
<li>Appendices- contains material that is too detailed to include in the research report example letter of consent, instruments of data collection, budget e.t.c</li>
</ol>
<h3>Types of report</h3>
<ol>
<li>Academic reports- these are completed academic reports such as dissertions, thesis, practicum and attachment reports. They are written by students in post secondary institutions e.g colleges</li>
<li>Technical reports- are associated with community projects and are dictated by the uses and audience being presented to. Highly scientific reports are presented to scientists who have knowledge and expertise to understand information contained therein.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Importance of a research report</h3>
<ol>
<li>Highlights current trends in research</li>
<li>Enhances report writing skills</li>
<li>It is a way of documenting and archiving the findings obtained.</li>
<li>Important reference points in future discussions, policy formulations and studies</li>
<li>To identify underlying problems.</li>
<li>Provides recommendations that may be used by policy makers, educationist and other stake holders.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>ETHICAL CONSIDERATION IN RESEARCH</h2>
<h3>Research ethical codes</h3>
<p>Define the different areas of responsibilities and expectations for the various groups involved. Ethical considerations protect the subjects against unprofessional conduct. The major ethical considerations in research include;</p>
<ol>
<li>Plagiarism-use of other peoples works without their consent or permission.</li>
<li>Use of human beings- using human subjects in research without their knowledge. They can also manipulate researchers to part with money for them to continue with research.</li>
<li>Confidentiality- the researcher is expected not to reveal certain information or identify subjects as requested by respondent.</li>
<li>Voluntary participation and need for informed consent- the participants in any research should participate voluntarily with no coercion or persuasion. They should also not participate because of promised monetary gains.</li>
<li>Permission to interview children- any researcher who desires to include children below the accepted consent age is expected to seek permission from the government, parents, teachers, doctors, since the law still takes them to be below consent age.</li>
<li>Risk to human participants- researcher should consider risks involved in their research and disclose them to the people who are potentially to be studied.</li>
