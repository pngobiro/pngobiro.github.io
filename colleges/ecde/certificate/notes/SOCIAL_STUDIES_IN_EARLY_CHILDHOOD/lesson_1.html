<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Introduction</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define terms related to social studies in early childhood</li>
<li>Describe types of socialization</li>
<li>Discuss the objectives of teaching social studies</li>
</ol>
<p>The term social refers to society. Social studies refer to the study of society. It encompasses the learning about social interaction with people and their environment. Children interact with teachers, pupils, and the environment. (KI.E 2006-2008)</p>
<p>Social studies can also refer to the study of issues affecting the life of an individual in society. It is the study of people living in a society or organization. It involves activities that will make an individual familiar with the environment so that she/he enhances social skills for appropriate social relationships and interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>A broad definition of social studies focuses on the study of people in terms of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>How they relate with one another</li>
<li>How they relate with the environment</li>
<li>How they control diversities in the environment</li>
<li>How the physical environment controls people</li>
</ol>
<p>This definition of social studies tends to focus on the life of an individual in the family and community as they interact with the physical environment. This simplification of social studies enables the child to understand who he or she is in the context of the social and physical environment.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Socialization</h3>
<p>It involves learning and performing behaviors expected of them by society for survival and working together through interaction. One learns behavior, one learns about his or her culture, and how to live within it. An individual gains skills and habits necessary for acting and taking part within their society. Society orientates the members to its moral norms, attitude values, motives, social roles, language, and symbols that ensure the continuity of social aspects and culture.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 15px;">Types of socialization</h4>
<p><strong>Primary socialization</strong></p>
<p>This occurs from birth to adolescence and is usually imposed by immediate family members or those close to the child at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary socialization</strong></p>
<p>It is the ongoing process of learning one goes through to adjust to new situations. Secondary socialization differs from primary socialization in that adults bring to the new situation the accumulated knowledge of their previous experiences, for example, experiences achieved from a formal setting like schools, training to receive professional know-how.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipatory socialization</strong></p>
<p>This refers to training in skills and values that is oriented towards a new role that one will enter in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Re-socialization</strong></p>
<p>It is associated with learning that takes place in institutions such as prisons or mental hospitals where members re-learn the social norms of society.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Community</h3>
<p>It is a deliberately organized group of people in a given location sharing common facilities, resources, interests, aspirations, and solidarity for the purpose of a common future. A community is interconnected, interdependent, and often has similar values and aims. It is a group that has a life of its own apart from the life of each member.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Environment</h3>
<p>The external conditions and surroundings that people live in. It’s made up of social, cultural issues, man-made and natural features which can positively or negatively affect individuals. It is divided into two: Physical and social environment.</p>
<p><strong>Physical environment</strong></p>
<p>It is the geography of a place, and therefore, children should be taught to function and live in the physical environment. This means they need to have mastered the craft of their physical environment.</p>
<p><strong>Social environment</strong></p>
<p>This has to do with the language, culture, beliefs, history, and traditions of a community. Children are expected to have mastery of the language of their community and understand the significance of the cultural practices and rites of passage. These oral traditions were passed on through proverbs, role-play, imitation, dances, direct instructions, riddles, songs, ceremonies, and stories.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Society</h3>
<p>It’s a group of people in an organized community or structured institutions with common aims and interests. It’s a group of people bound by cultural identity, social solidarity, and functional interdependence. Human societies have patterns of interrelationships between individuals that share unique cultures or institutions. Individuals are allowed to achieve their needs or wishes that they can’t achieve when alone.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>It is made up of people with families and is also made up of institutions. Ethnic groups form a community. The child should identify the neighborhood institutions, e.g., church, school, health center, and they should be guided to know the people in these places, the work they do, and the equipment they use.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Country</h3>
<p>It is made up of different communities, and children should know their community and others. They should be helped to interact with and conserve their cultural heritage. They should know the president, national anthem, the flag, etc. The teacher should guide them in songs, poems, naming people, society structure, role-play of people’s jobs, drawing, coloring, and pictures related to society.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Objectives of social studies in ECD curriculum</h3>
<p>Social studies deal with people’s interaction within the environment. From the beginning, children are put in a social setup. They interact with the social and physical environment. They face challenges adjusting to the environment due to little knowledge of environmental concepts, limited skills, and an inability to explain their immediate environment. Social studies address their limitations and egocentric nature.</p>
<p>Through social studies, a child should be able to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Familiarize themselves with the surrounding environment through nature walks, observation, clips, also by identifying, naming, using, and associating with the immediate environment.</li>
<li>Accept the surrounding environment and cultural heritage and strive to conserve them. They can do this by making sisal skirts, toys, ropes, singing local community songs.</li>
<li>Use things found within the environment properly. This should be done using elements of nature constructively. These include trees, flowers, rivers, plants, animals, etc. They should only use what they need and leave the rest intact.</li>
<li>Develop observational and discovery skills. Children prefer living creatures to dead ones. The teacher can plan educational trips for them to experience, observe, and discover things in their natural setup, e.g., the museum.</li>
<li>Acquire acceptable health habits and maintain good habits through eating a balanced diet, adequate exercise, and rest. This is done by ensuring that they wash their hands after using the toilet, use a handkerchief to blow their nose. Ensure they eat a balanced diet by advising their parents. Encourage them in physical activities for body exercise. For the young ones, provide rest time in the afternoon.</li>
<li>Appreciate interaction with other people in the environment. When children join preschool or class one, they join a new social environment. They need to be guided and engaged in activities that will bond them to their new surroundings. They can express their needs, feelings, and emotions. Resource people should be invited from nearby, and children should ask them questions. The children should appreciate other people’s talents, e.g., those with the talents of playing musical instruments, composing poems, etc. At school, they interact with teachers, peers, and new friends. The teacher can engage them in songs, new games, role-play, and they should appreciate the teacher or pupil who wins the game.</li>
<li>Identify life skills required in environmental awareness. It involves the ability to control oneself, decision-making, problem-solving, and making choices. The teacher should tell stories or use role-play to help them develop such skills. They should acquire skills that can be used to organize and address the environment. This involves field visits, theme walks, nature walks, singing songs, reciting poems on specific concepts learned from the environment, e.g., they can compose a song on flowers, trees, rivers, etc.</li>
