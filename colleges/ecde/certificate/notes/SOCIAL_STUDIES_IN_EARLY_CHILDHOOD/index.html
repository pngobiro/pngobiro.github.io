<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">PURPOSE OF THE COURSE</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This course will help the learner to develop an understanding of methods, approaches, content, and resources for use in teaching social studies to young children.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This course entails the definition of terms and concepts used in social studies, social interaction, and the learning environment of the pre-school child. It also entails resource materials and records.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">TEACHING/LEARNING METHODOLOGIES</h3>
<p>This course will be offered and/or undertaken through tutorials, group discussions, group and individual assignments, presentations, interactive questions and answers, micro-teaching lessons, peer teaching, and e-learning interactive forums. The learner will be required to go through this training module, make notes based on the objectives of the course, and attempt the questions given at the end of every lesson. Tutorial classes will be organized by the university where the lecturer will take the student through the course. The purpose of tutorials is to help the learner conceptualize the course. It is, therefore, important to study the module before attending the tutorials. Further reading in this area of the curriculum is encouraged. However, all information gathered should be within the course description and objectives.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">COURSE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION</h3>
<p>Learning will be assessed through sit-in, Continuous Assessment Tests (CATs), Take Away Assignments, and a Main Examination. The CATs will constitute 30% and the Examination 70%.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">MODULE ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>This module is organized in the form of lessons. In every lesson, an introduction is given. The introduction shows what the lesson constitutes. This is followed by the lesson objectives. Then, the learner is taken through the lesson content. The content may be sub-divided into sub-topics depending on the nature of the topic in a lesson. A summary of what has been learned is given. At the end of the lesson, the learner is given activities. These activities are in the form of questions and/or practical exercises. It is good to note that this is not a textbook. The content is therefore in the form of lecture notes. Further reading from textbooks is recommended. A list of books to refer to is given at the end of the module.</p>
