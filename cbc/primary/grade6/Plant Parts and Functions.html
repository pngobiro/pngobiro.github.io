    <h1>Plant Parts and Functions</h1>
    
    <h2>Parts of a Plant</h2>
    <p>The figure below shows the main parts of a plant, which include the roots, stem, fruits, leaves, and flowers.</p>
    <img src="https://www.exploringnature.org/graphics/teaching_aids/plant_diag_no_labels.jpg" alt="Plant Diagram">
    
    <h2>Functions of Parts of a Plant</h2>
    
    <h3>Functions of the Roots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They absorb water and mineral salts from the soil through a process called <strong>absorption</strong>.</li>
        <li>They hold the plant firmly in the soil through a process called <strong>anchorage</strong>.</li>
        <li>Some plants such as potatoes, carrots, yams, cassavas, and sweet potatoes store their food in their roots.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        <p>Roots that store food are known as <strong>tuberous roots</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Functions of the Stems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stems transport water, food, and mineral salts from the roots to other parts of the plant including the leaves.</li>
        <li>Some plants' stems store water such as the Cactus.</li>
        <li>Plants' including Sugarcane and Potatoes store food in their stems.</li>
        <li>The stem is used to hold other parts of the plants including leaves, flowers, and branches.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Functions of the Leaves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leaves have tiny holes known as <strong>stomata</strong> that are used to remove excess water from the plant through <strong>transpiration</strong>.</li>
        <li>Green plants (those with chlorophyll) make food in the leaves through a process called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>.</li>
        <li>Leaves in plants are used in gaseous exchange where they take in carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen to the air through the stomata. Animals breathe in the oxygen released.</li>
        <li>Some plants such as cabbages and onions use their leaves to store food.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Chlorophyll</strong> is a green pigment found in plants that gives leaves their green color.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Functions of Flowers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flowers develop into fruits. The part of a flower that develops into a fruit is known as an <strong>ovary</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Functions of Fruits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruits are used to store food. Some fruits used to store food include mango, avocado, pawpaw.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Functions of Seeds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Seeds germinate and grow to become new plants.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Roots</h2>
    <p>There are two main types of plant roots. These are: <strong>tap roots</strong> and <strong>fibrous roots</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tap roots</strong> have one main root. Plants that have tap roots include beans, cabbage, and peas.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibrous roots</strong> have many branches of roots that originate from the stem and spread in different ways. Some plants that have fibrous roots include: maize, sugarcane, and grass.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Differences between tap root and fibrous roots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tap roots have a main root while the fibrous roots do not.</li>
        <li>Tap roots grow vertically while the fibrous roots may tend to grow and spread horizontally.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>We Should Note That:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plants are part of our environment, and we should take care of them.</li>
        <li>Some plants, such as Cactus, have thorns that can cause injuries.</li>
        <li>Some plants are poisonous and can make us or our livestock ill.</li>
        <li>Plants are sources of human food and animal feeds.</li>
        <li>Plants help clean the air that we breathe in.</li>
    </ul>
