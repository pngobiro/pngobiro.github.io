        <p>The circulatory system is like a network of pipes that carry blood all around your body. It's made up of three main parts: the heart, blood vessels, and blood.</p>

<h2>The Heart</h2>
	<p>The heart is a powerful muscle that pumps blood through the body. It's about the size of your fist and is located in the middle of your chest.</p>

	<p>The heart has four chambers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Right Atrium</strong>: Receives blood from the body</li>
		<li><strong>Right Ventricle</strong>: Pumps blood to the lungs</li>
		<li><strong>Left Atrium</strong>: Receives blood from the lungs</li>
		<li><strong>Left Ventricle</strong>: Pumps blood to the body</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Blood Vessels</h2>
	<p>Blood vessels are like pipes that carry blood throughout the body. There are three main types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Arteries</strong>: Carry blood away from the heart</li>
		<li><strong>Veins</strong>: Carry blood back to the heart</li>
		<li><strong>Capillaries</strong>: Tiny vessels that allow the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between blood and body cells</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Blood</h2>
	<p>Blood is a liquid that flows through the blood vessels. It has four main components:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Plasma</strong>: The liquid part that carries nutrients, hormones, and waste products</li>
		<li><strong>Red Blood Cells</strong>: Carry oxygen from the lungs to the body cells</li>
		<li><strong>White Blood Cells</strong>: Help fight infections and diseases</li>
		<li><strong>Platelets</strong>: Help with blood clotting</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How Does the Circulatory System Work?</h2>
	<p>The heart pumps blood through the body in a continuous loop:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.</li>
		<li>The oxygen-rich blood returns to the left side of the heart.</li>
		<li>The left side of the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the body through the arteries.</li>
		<li>The blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to the body cells through the capillaries.</li>
		<li>The blood picks up waste products from the body cells.</li>
		<li>The blood returns to the right side of the heart through the veins.</li>
		<li>The cycle repeats.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Why Is the Circulatory System Important?</h2>
	<p>The circulatory system is essential for life because it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Transports oxygen and nutrients to all the body cells</li>
		<li>Removes waste products from the body cells</li>
		<li>Helps fight infections and diseases</li>
		<li>Helps regulate body temperature</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Taking care of your circulatory system by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking can help keep it working properly.</p>
