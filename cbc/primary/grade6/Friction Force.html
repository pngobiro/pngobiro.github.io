        <h2>What is Friction?</h2>
        <p>Friction is the force acting between two rough surfaces when they slide over each other. It opposes motion.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of Friction Force</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Friction enables us to walk without sliding.</li>
            <li>Friction helps in lighting a matchstick when rubbed against a matchbox.</li>
            <li>Friction aids in rubbing the board.</li>
            <li>Friction assists in sharpening or filing cutting tools.</li>
            <li>Carpenters use sandpaper to smoothen rough surfaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Have you ever tried to walk outside on mud after it has rained? It is usually very difficult. This is because the mud is slippery and it reduces the friction between our feet and the ground.</p>
        <h2>Disadvantages of Friction Force</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Friction produces unnecessary heat, leading to wastage of energy.</li>
            <li>Friction wears out shoes and tires due to contact with the earth's surface.</li>
            <li>Friction makes work or movement difficult.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ways of Increasing Friction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Increasing force between surfaces.</li>
            <li>Creating a rough point of contact. This is why shoe soles and car tires are rough.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Ways to Reduce Friction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Making the surface smoother.</li>
            <li>Lubricating. This is oiling or greasing moving parts.</li>
            <li>Streamlining bodies such as cars or airplanes.</li>
            <li>Using ball-bearings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While cars have treads (deep wavy lines on a tire's surface) to increase friction with the ground, their bodies are shaped in a way to reduce air resistance. This is known as reducing a car's drag.</p>
