        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Matter is everything around us that takes up space and has mass. Matter can be found in three different states: solid, liquid, and gas. When matter is heated, it expands, meaning it takes up more space. When matter is cooled, it contracts, meaning it takes up less space.</p>

        <h2>Expansion and Contraction in Solids</h2>

        <p>Solids have a definite shape and volume. When a solid is heated, its molecules move faster and take up more space, causing the solid to expand. When a solid is cooled, its molecules slow down and take up less space, causing the solid to contract.</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A metal ball expands when heated and contracts when cooled.</li>
            <li>A glass bottle expands when heated, causing the liquid inside to rise. When the bottle is cooled, it contracts, causing the liquid level to fall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Expansion and Contraction in Liquids</h2>

        <p>Liquids have a definite volume but no definite shape. They take the shape of the container they are in. When a liquid is heated, its molecules move faster and take up more space, causing the liquid to expand. When a liquid is cooled, its molecules slow down and take up less space, causing the liquid to contract.</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Water expands when heated and contracts when cooled.</li>
            <li>A balloon filled with air expands when heated and contracts when cooled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Expansion and Contraction in Gases</h2>

        <p>Gases have no definite shape or volume. They expand to fill the container they are in. When a gas is heated, its molecules move faster and take up more space, causing the gas to expand. When a gas is cooled, its molecules slow down and take up less space, causing the gas to contract.</p>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A balloon filled with air expands when heated and contracts when cooled.</li>
            <li>The pressure inside a container increases when the gas inside is heated. When the gas is cooled, the pressure decreases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Expansion and Contraction</h2>

        <p>The principles of expansion and contraction are used in various everyday applications, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>**Thermometers:** Thermometers use the expansion and contraction of a liquid to measure temperature.</li>
            <li>**Bimetallic Strips:** Bimetallic strips, made of two different metals that expand and contract at different rates, are used in thermostats to control temperature.</li>
            <li>**Bridges:** Bridges are built with expansion joints to allow for expansion and contraction during temperature changes.</li>
            <li>**Railway Tracks:** Railway tracks are laid with gaps between them to allow for expansion and contraction of the tracks during temperature changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Expansion and contraction are important properties of matter, used in many everyday applications. By understanding these principles, we can utilize them to our advantage in various practical situations.</p>
