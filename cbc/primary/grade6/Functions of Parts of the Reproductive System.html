        <h2>Functions of Parts of the Reproductive System</h2>

        <p>The reproductive system is responsible for creating new life. It's made up of different parts in both males and females, and each part has a special job to do.</p>

        <h3>Male Reproductive Parts</h3>

        <img src="male_reproductive_system.png" alt="Male Reproductive System">

        

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Penis</h3>
                <p>The penis delivers sperm to the female's reproductive system. It also releases urine from the body.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Urethra</h3>
                <p>This tube runs inside the penis and carries both sperm and urine out of the body.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Testes</h3>
                <p>These two small organs produce sperm, the male reproductive cells.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sperm duct</h3>
                <p>This tube carries sperm from the testes to the urethra.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cowper's Glands</h3>
                <p>These glands produce a fluid that helps sperm swim and survive.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>When sperm mixes with this fluid, it's called semen.</p>



        <h3>Female Reproductive Parts</h3>

        <img src="female_reproductive_system.png" alt="Female Reproductive System">

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Vagina</h3>
                <p>The vagina is also called the birth canal. It receives sperm from the penis and is the passageway for a baby to be born.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Ovaries</h3>
                <p>These two organs produce eggs, the female reproductive cells. They also produce hormones that control the menstrual cycle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fallopian tubes</h3>
                <p>These tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. This is where fertilization happens if an egg meets a sperm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Uterus</h3>
                <p>The uterus, also called the womb, is where a baby grows and develops if an egg is fertilized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cervix</h3>
                <p>This is a strong muscle that connects the vagina to the uterus.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both the male and female reproductive systems are essential for creating new life. Each part plays a vital role in the process of reproduction.</p>

        <h2>Physical Changes During Adolescence</h2>

        <p>Adolescence is a time when your body goes through many changes as you transition from a child to an adult. These changes can be exciting, but they can also be confusing or even a little scary. Here are some of the physical changes you might experience:</p>
