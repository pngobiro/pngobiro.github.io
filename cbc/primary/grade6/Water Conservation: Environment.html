        <h2>What is Water Conservation?</h2>
        <p>Water conservation is the proper use and care of water without wasting. It ensures there's water for future use and minimizes the effects of drought by keeping water available during dry seasons. Conserving water also contributes to a healthy environment.</p>
        <h2>Ways of Conserving Water</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Reusing water.</li>
            <li>Reducing use of water.</li>
            <li>Recycling used water.</li>
            <li>Harvesting rainwater.</li>
            <li>Constructing dams.</li>
            <li>Mulching.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Reusing as a Method of Water Conservation</h3>
        <p>Reusing water involves using it for another purpose after its initial use. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water used to rinse clothes can be sprinkled on an earthen floor to keep off dust.</li>
            <li>Water used to wash vegetables can be used to water plants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Harvesting Rainwater</h3>
        <p>Rainwater should be harvested and stored in tanks for later use. During rainfall, containers can be used to collect water.</p>

        <h3>Reducing Use and Wastage of Water at Home and in School</h3>
        <p>Wastage of water can be reduced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Repairing leaking taps.</li>
            <li>Using a basin for bathing instead of a shower.</li>
            <li>Watering plants using watering bottles instead of overhead irrigation.</li>
            <li>Using a glass to drink water instead of drinking directly from the tap.</li>
            <li>Turning off water taps after use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recycling as a Method of Water Conservation</h3>
        <p>Recycling water involves treating used water to make it suitable for reuse.</p>
        <h3>Mulching as a Method of Water Conservation</h3>
        <p>Young plants can be covered with dry plant materials around the base of the stem to reduce evaporation of water from the soil, thus conserving moisture.</p>
        <h3>Construction of Dams</h3>
        <p>Dams are used to hold flowing water for future use and are also known as water reservoirs.</p>
