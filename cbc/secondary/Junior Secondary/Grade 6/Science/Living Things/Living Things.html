    <h2>Living Things</h2>
    <p>The term "living thing" refers to any organism or life form that possesses or shows characteristics of life or being alive.</p>
    <h2>Plants</h2>
<p>Plants are living things. The grouping of plants together with common characteristics or features is called the classification of plants.</p>

<h2>Types of Plants</h2>
<p>There are different types of plants, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Trees</h3>
        <p>Trees are big plants with a single stem called a trunk and many strong branches. Examples of trees include mango, coconut, and avocado trees.</p>
        <img src="mango-tree.jpg" alt="Mango Tree" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Shrubs</h3>
        <p>Shrubs are shorter than trees and have many thin, woody stems. Examples of shrubs include hibiscus, rose, and cotton plants.</p>
        <img src="rose-bush.jpg" alt="Rose Bush" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Herbs</h3>
        <p>Herbs are small plants with soft green stems. Examples of herbs include mint and coriander.</p>
        <img src="mint-plant.jpg" alt="Mint Plant" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Grasses</h3>
        <p>Grasses are short plants with narrow leaves.</p>
        <img src="grass.jpg" alt="Grass" />
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Parts of a Plant</h2>
<p>The external parts of a plant include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Roots</li>
    <li>Stem</li>
    <li>Leaves</li>
    <li>Flowers</li>
    <li>Fruits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions of Plant Parts</h2>

        <th>Part of a Plant</th>
        <th>Function</th>

    </tr>

<h2>Types of Roots</h2>
<p>There are two main types of roots:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Tap Roots</h3>
        <p>Tap roots consist of one main root that grows down into the soil, with side roots arising from the main root. They grow deep into the soil vertically downwards. Plants with tap roots include legumes, acacia, and fruit trees.</p>
        <img src="tap-root.jpg" alt="Tap Root" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Fibrous Roots</h3>
        <p>Fibrous roots do not have a main root; all roots are similar and arise from the same place. They are shallow and grow horizontally in all directions. Plants with fibrous roots include cereals, oats, grass, sisal, onions, and sugarcane.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison of Tap Roots and Fibrous Roots</h3>

      <th>Fibrous Roots</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>They consist of one main root that grows down into the soil</td>
      <td>They do not have a main root</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lateral Roots</td>
      <td>They have lateral roots that arise from the main root</td>
      <td>All roots are similar and arise from the same place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Depth</td>
      <td>They grow deep into the soil</td>
      <td>They are shallow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Growth Direction</td>
      <td>They grow vertically downwards into the soil</td>
      <td>They grow horizontally in all directions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Examples</td>
      <td>Legumes, Acacia, Fruit trees, Coconuts</td>
      <td>Cereals, Oats, Grass, Sisal, Onions, Sugarcane</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

<p>Other types of roots include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aerial roots (for breathing)</li>
    <li>Prop roots (used in maize for support)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transpiration in Plants</h2>
<p>Transpiration is the process in which plants lose excess water through small holes called stomata. Transpiration is high when it's hot, sunny, dry, and windy, and low when it's cold, wet, calm, and rainy.</p>
