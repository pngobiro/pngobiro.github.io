   <h2>Basketry</h2>
   <p>Basketry is the art of making containers and other items using flexible fibers.</p>

   <h3>Coil and Stitch Technique</h3>
   <p>It is the art of coiling materials and stitching them together using a needle and thread to make an item.</p>

   <h3>Samples of Coil and Stitch Items</h3>
   <p>There are two types of coils:</p>
   <ul>
       <li><strong>Plaited coils:</strong> Made by braiding two or more strands of a material to make a pattern.</li>
       <li><strong>Rolled coils:</strong> Made by rolling strands of materials together.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Items made using the coil and stitch technique are made using any suitable materials that can be rolled, e.g., banana fibers, palm leaves.</p>

   <p>In weaving, the materials used are interlaced vertically and horizontally on a loom to form an item. The vertical threads are called warps, and the horizontal threads are the wefts or fillings.</p>

   <p>In basketry, one does not use a loom.</p>

   <p>In the coil and stitch technique, the materials are rolled in a circular form and stitched together using a needle and a string.</p>

   <h3>Selecting Materials for Coil and Stitch Technique</h3>
   <p>Coil and stitch materials can be sourced from:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Natural materials</li>
       <li>Man-made materials</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Natural materials are those that can be found in the environment, such as:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Raffia</li>
       <li>Wool</li>
       <li>Silk</li>
       <li>Reeds</li>
       <li>Cane</li>
       <li>Banana fibers</li>
       <li>Sisal</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Man-made materials include synthetic materials such as:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Nylon</li>
       <li>Carbon fiber</li>
       <li>Polyester</li>
       <li>Yarn</li>
       <li>Acrylic yarn</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Materials used in the coil and stitch technique should be flexible and easy to roll to form the coils needed.</p>

   <p>When selecting materials to make a door mat using the coil and stitch technique, consider whether they are:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Durable</li>
       <li>Easy to clean</li>
       <li>Non-slippery (Always use non-slippery materials to avoid slip and fall accidents)</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Preparing Selected Materials for Coil and Stitch Technique</h3>
   <p>There are different ways to prepare materials to be used to make an item using the coil and stitch technique, including:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Dyeing</li>
       <li>Plaiting</li>
       <li>Tearing</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Methods of Preparing Selected Materials for Coil and Stitch Technique</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>
           <strong>Tearing Method</strong>
           <p>Involves splitting materials such as banana fibers into thin strips for easier use. This can be done using your hands or a fiber stripper.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <strong>Dyeing</strong>
           <p>Is the process of changing the original color of materials used to make an item to different colors.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <strong>Plaiting</strong>
           <p>Is a technique whereby strands of suitable materials such as rope or silk are braided together to make a single string of fiber.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <strong>Stripping Method</strong>
           <ol type="A">
               <li>Collect the suggested tools: Fiber stripper/basin/cutting tools/sisal/water.</li>
               <li>Split the sisal stem into thin strips that can fit in the fiber stripper.</li>
               <li>Place the sisal strips in the middle of the fiber stripper and pull them through to get sisal fiber.</li>
               <li>Wash the fiber using clean water.</li>
               <li>Dry the washed sisal fiber in the open sun.</li>
           </ol>
       </li>
   </ol>

   <h3>What to Consider When Coiling and Stitching an Item</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Uniformity of coils</li>
       <li>Consistent tension</li>
       <li>Craftsmanship</li>
       <li>Materials</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Making a Floor Mat Using Coil and Stitch Technique With Man-Made Materials or Natural Materials</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Collect the suggested materials and tools: Needle/scissors/thread/man-made materials.</li>
       <li>Prepare the strand by rolling the length of the strand you need.</li>
       <li>Use nylon paper or sellotape to wrap and cover the beginning end of the strand.</li>
       <li>Coil the wrapped end of the strand to form a small circle. Using a thread and needle, stitch the wrapped end of the strand by inserting and pulling the needle through the strand. Start stitching from the center as you move outwards.</li>
       <li>Fasten the loop after the first round by passing the needle from right towards the left onto the back of the strand.</li>
       <li>Continue to coil and stitch the strand to make a mat. Add more rope until you get your desired size of the floor mat.</li>
       <li>Finish the floor mat by fastening the end of the strand using stitches.</li>
       <li>Display your floor mat.</li>
   </ol>
