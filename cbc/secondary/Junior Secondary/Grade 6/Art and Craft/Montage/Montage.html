   <h2>Pictorial Composition</h2>
   <h3>Montage Pictorial Composition</h3>
   <p>Montage is a picture composition that is created by cutting and joining images that relate to each other.</p>
   <p>The cut-out pictures used to create a montage are glued on a surface known as the base or mounting surface. The base used should be flat, such as:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Manila paper</li>
       <li>Cardboard</li>
       <li>Hardboard</li>
       <li>Plywood</li>
       <li>Or any other flat surface</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Characteristics of a Montage</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>In a montage, pictures are arranged in a manner that they can overlap each other. Overlapping means one picture is glued on top of the other.</li>
       <li>Pictures used to make a montage can be sourced from old newspapers, old magazines, calendars, or downloaded and printed images from the internet.</li>
       <li>The pictures used are usually related so as to tell the same story or communicate a particular message.</li>
       <li>Cut-out text can also be used to help a montage communicate even better.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Spacing and Balancing Forms in a Montage Composition</h3>
   <p>Arranging cut-out images on the base before pasting them will help you achieve balance when creating a montage.</p>
   <p>You can choose to arrange the picture cut-outs side by side or overlap them.</p>
   <p>In montage, overlapping involves putting one picture cut-out on top of another in a way that allows the picture at the back to be partly visible.</p>
   <p>When overlapping, let the small picture cut-outs be glued on top of the big picture cut-outs.</p>
   <p>Ensure proper use of space by using more than half of the mounting surface. Good use of space helps create balance and a center of interest for the montage.</p>
   <p>When balancing objects, arrange them in a way that they communicate well with each other to tell a story or send a message.</p>

   <h3>Creating a Montage Composition</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Collect the suggested tools and materials: base/adhesive/razor/scissors/pictures.</li>
       <li>Pick the subject matter for your montage.</li>
       <li>Cut out the pictures you need for your montage.</li>
       <li>Arrange the picture cut-outs on the base.</li>
       <li>Mark the position of each picture to avoid disarranging when you will be pasting.</li>
       <li>Apply glue to the back side of each picture cut-out and then paste it onto the base.</li>
       <li>Add more details to your montage by making cut-outs of other things like grass.</li>
       <li>You can trim parts of the cut-outs that are outside the mounting surface.</li>
       <li>Mount your work.</li>
   </ol>
