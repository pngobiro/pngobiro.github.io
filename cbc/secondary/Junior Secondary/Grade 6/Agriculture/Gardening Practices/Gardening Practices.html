   <h2>Organic Gardening Of Legumes</h2>
   <p>Legumes include:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Pigeon peas</li>
       <li>Common beans</li>
       <li>Dolichos lablab beans</li>
       <li>Green grams</li>
       <li>Groundnuts</li>
       <li>Cowpeas</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The roots of legumes have small swellings called root nodules where some very tiny living things called nitrogen-fixing bacteria live. These bacteria take up nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into nutrients that are then absorbed by the legume crops to make proteins.</p>

   <h2>Meaning Of Organic Gardening</h2>
   <p>Organic gardening refers to a system of growing crops using natural farming techniques and materials instead of artificial chemicals. In organic gardening, compost, compost manure, and animal manures are used instead of artificial fertilizers.</p>
   <p>The organic manures feed the soil, which in turn feeds the crops with nutrients, leading to strong and healthy crops. Healthy crops are able to tolerate the effects of drought, pests, and diseases, which are the main causes of low yields.</p>
   <p>Organic manure enables the soil to hold enough moisture for crop growth. In organic gardening, artificial chemicals such as pesticides are not used. Chemicals also cause harm to animals, including beneficial insects that feed on pests or those that pollinate our crops.</p>

   <h2>Establishing a Legume Crop</h2>
   <p>Proper seedbed preparation helps to remove weeds and loosen the soil for easy sowing of seeds. Organic manures should be incorporated into the soil during seedbed preparation.</p>
   <p>Seeds for planting should be healthy, whole, and dry. The selected seed should also be suited to the climate and soil of a given place. Green grams, cowpeas, and pigeon peas grow well in semi-arid areas because they are drought-resistant. Garden peas require cool and moist areas.</p>
   <p>To ensure seeds germinate with ease, it is important to sow seeds at the proper planting depth, i.e., between 2.5 cm to 10 cm. Two to three seeds can be planted per hole using the correct spacing. Proper spacing ensures that the crops receive adequate nutrients, water, sunlight, and air for proper growth.</p>

   <h2>Caring for Growing Legume Crops</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>Irrigation if there is no rainfall</li>
       <li>Waterlogged seedbed should be avoided</li>
       <li>Application of water directly on the leaves should be avoided</li>
       <li>Mulching should be done to retain moisture</li>
       <li>Gapping to replace the seedlings which fail to germinate</li>
       <li>Thinning to remove excess seedlings</li>
       <li>Correct number of plants per hole to reduce competition for nutrients, water, and light</li>
       <li>Pests should be regularly controlled using appropriate methods, such as:
           <ul>
               <li>Hand picking</li>
               <li>Spraying</li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Infected crops by diseases should be uprooted and destroyed by burning</li>
       <li>Weeding during the rainy season should be avoided to prevent rapid spread of diseases</li>
       <li>Climbing legume crops should be supported to grow upright</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Right Stage of Harvesting</h2>
   <p>Some legumes are harvested while green and eaten as vegetables, such as beans and peas. Some are left to dry and harvested when they have lost their green color. Mature legume pods turn brown and dry.</p>
   <p>To determine when groundnuts are mature, a few plants are lifted to observe the pods before harvesting all the groundnuts.</p>
   <p>Harvesting should be done during dry weather conditions.</p>

   <h2>Innovative Ornamental Gardening</h2>
   <p>Ornamental gardening refers to the cultivation of plants with the aim of enhancing the beauty of a place or landscape. Some crops can also be grown in a pattern that can make our surroundings beautiful.</p>
   <p>Ornamental cropping can be done in learning institutions, hospitals, hotels, public parks, homes, and sports fields.</p>
   <p>Innovative ornamental patterns can also be made by using plants in containers or on the ground. The plants used could be flowers, trees, shrubs, or food crops such as sugarcane, bananas, fruit crops, or vegetables. When food crops are used for ornamental gardening, they bring beauty and also contribute to food security.</p>

   <h2>Growing Media For Ornamental Crops</h2>
   <p>Ornamental plants can be established in two ways:</p>
   <ol>
       <li>Using soil as a base to support the roots of ornamental plants</li>
       <li>Using soilless media as a base to support the roots of the ornamental</li>
   </ol>
   <p>The surface on which plants grow is called the plant's growing medium. Soil is a natural growing medium for plants. Soilless medium can also be used to establish ornamental crops. The nutrients can be supplied from liquid manure (called compost tea) when soilless medium is used.</p>
   <p>Note: Compost tea is organic compost manure mixed with water.</p>
   <p>Some of the media for growing ornamental crops include:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Peat moss</li>
       <li>Coco peat</li>
       <li>Sand</li>
       <li>Gravel</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Establishing Ornamental Plants in Soilless Media</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Identify a soilless media to use in a container</li>
       <li>Measure the quantity of the soilless medium that can fill about three-quarters of each available container</li>
       <li>Put the identified soilless medium in a container or containers</li>
       <li>Add some water to moisten the soilless medium</li>
       <li>Plant an ornamental plant or crop of your choice in the container garden(s)</li>
       <li>Select a suitable site and place your container garden in a pattern that suits your preference</li>
       <li>Apply liquid manure or compost tea around the base of ornamental plants from time to supply nutrients</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Preparing Compost Tea</h2>
   <p>Tools:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Two 20-liter buckets</li>
       <li>Clean fresh water</li>
       <li>Organic manure</li>
       <li>Stick for stirring</li>
       <li>Strainer</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Steps:</p>
   <ol>
       <li>Scoop organic manure into an empty 20-liter bucket up to a third of the bucket</li>
       <li>Add clean fresh water (not chlorinated, rainwater is best) to fill the bucket and stir with a stick</li>
       <li>Set aside the mixture to brew for 12 to 36 hours away from direct sunlight</li>
       <li>Strain the compost using a clean piece of cloth; return the leftover to a compost bin or use it as mulch</li>
       <li>Dilute the mixture in the ratio of 1:3 only if it is very dark in color</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Note:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>The volume of water should be twice that of liquid manure</li>
       <li>Do not use unfinished compost in your compost tea. Unfinished tea may contain living things that could damage plants</li>
       <li>Use the compost tea once a week to avoid scorching of plants</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Importance of Innovative Ornamental Cropping</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>Beautifies the environment</li>
       <li>Source of food</li>
       <li>Supplies fresh air for human beings and other animals</li>
       <li>Can be used as a beautiful photograph background when taking photographs</li>
       <li>Some act as windbreakers, hence less destruction of the built environment</li>
       <li>Requires less space</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Moisture Bed Gardening</h2>
   <h3>How to Prepare a Raised Moisture Bed</h3>
   <p>Tools and Materials:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Topsoil</li>
       <li>Compost manure or farmyard manure</li>
       <li>Dry grass</li>
       <li>Kitchen wastes</li>
       <li>Gravel</li>
       <li>Fork jembe</li>
       <li>Wooden pegs</li>
       <li>Ten 90cm long fitos</li>
       <li>A panga</li>
       <li>Claw hammer</li>
       <li>A thick polythene</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Steps:</p>
   <ol>
       <li>Select a suitable site for your garden and clear any vegetation on it</li>
       <li>Measure the land on the ground so that it is 1m wide and the desired length</li>
       <li>Fix 90cm long wooden stakes about 30cm below the ground along the edges of the marked areas</li>
       <li>Inside the framework created by the stakes, lay a thick polythene sheet on the ground</li>
       <li>Lay a 30cm layer of hard-core or gravel carefully at the bottom</li>
       <li>Place a 10cm layer of dry grass or kitchen waste such as fruit and vegetable peels on top of the gravel</li>
       <li>Add a 20cm layer of topsoil mixed with compost manure</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Your raised moisture bed is now ready for crop establishment.</p>
   <p>Note: You can obtain the topsoil from another place or dig out the topsoil from the same site before laying the polythene sheet.</p>

   <h3>Taking Care of the Crop on Moisture Bed</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>There is constant production of crops throughout the year</li>
       <li>Soil is full of organic manure</li>
       <li>Many crops can be planted on a small area, leading to high yields</li>
       <li>Some crops that don't do well in a normal environment can be established here</li>
       <li>There is high water retention</li>
   </ul>
