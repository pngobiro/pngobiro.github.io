    <h2>Repellents and Deterrents</h2>
    <p>Repellents such as smoke, noise, and certain smelly substances can keep wild animals away from our crops and domestic animals.</p>
    <p>Deterrent methods are used to prevent wild animals from damaging our crops and domestic animals, e.g., the use of fences and lights.</p>
    <h3>Using Fences to Keep Away Wild Animals</h3>
<p>Wire mesh fences and thick, thorny bush fences help keep wild animals away from crops and domestic animals.</p>
<p>Pupils activity: Observe and learn about different types of fences used to deter wild animals.</p>

<h3>Using Innovative Lights to Control Wild Animals</h3>
<p>Animals fear random sounds, deflecting lights, and blinking or flashing lights. These devices can keep wild animals away at night from crops.</p>
<p>Light bulbs can be installed near cattle bomas or around gardens.</p>
<p>Pupils activity: Plan how to make innovative deterrents using lights and sounds.</p>

<h3>Constructing Innovative Deterrents</h3>
<p>Pupils activity: Construct innovative deterrents to scare away wild animals.</p>

<h3>Making Sound Deterrents</h3>
<p>Using a device that can produce loud noise can also help scare wild animals away.</p>
<p>The following can be used as deterrents to keep birds away:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spoilt cassette tapes</li>
    <li>Old reflective Compact Discs (CDs)</li>
    <li>Reflective tapes</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils activity: Make sound deterrents using locally available materials.</p>

<h3>Making a Bird Feeding Table</h3>
<p>Safe traps can be used to trap some wild animals, which can then be released back into the forest.</p>
<p>During the day, birds can be kept away by hanging shiny reflective CDs or reflective ribbons, such as shiny party streamers, near the garden. The light reflected from the shiny surfaces of such objects distracts the vision of birds. The birds are also scared by the sound reflective ribbons make when it's windy.</p>
<p>Pupils activity: Make a bird feeding table using locally available materials.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select a suitable site to place the bird feeding table.</li>
    <li>Regularly place some food remains and water on the bird feeding table.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Importance of Deterrents in Conserving Wild Animals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wild animals are important because they support our tourism industry, which earns revenue for our country. They should not be killed when they come to our farms.</li>
    <li>Using deterrents helps us live better or coexist with wild animals in our environment.</li>
    <li>It aids in saving the lives of wild animals.</li>
    <li>Birds are a source of beauty and happiness to human beings.</li>
    <li>Traps can be used to capture wild animals, which are then released back into game parks.</li>
    <li>Reflective ribbons scare birds away during the day.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further Learning Resources</h3>
<p>To enhance your understanding of living better with wild animals, explore the following resources:</p>

<p>Remember, wildlife is an essential part of our ecosystem, and it's our responsibility to find ways to coexist harmoniously with these creatures while protecting our crops and livestock.</p>
