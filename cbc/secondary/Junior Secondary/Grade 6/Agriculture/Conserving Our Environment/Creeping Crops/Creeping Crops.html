    <h2>What are Creeping Crops?</h2>
    <p>Creeping crops are plants that naturally spread their weak stems horizontally on the ground rather than vertically. As the stems of these plants spread, they produce new plants along the stem. Creeping crops can serve as good cover crops.</p>

    <h3>Identifying Creeping Crops</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Strawberries plant</li>
        <li>Watermelon plant</li>
        <li>Pumpkin plant</li>
        <li>Cucumber plant</li>
        <li>Calabash plant</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Planting Materials for Creeping Plants</h2>
    <h3>Identifying Planting Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Seeds (e.g., cucumbers, pumpkins, melons):
            <ul>
                <li>The seeds are obtained from mature fruits of some creeping crops.</li>
                <li>Seeds can also be bought from reputable seed suppliers or agricultural research stations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Vegetative materials (e.g., splits and vine cuttings):
            <ul>
                <li>Planting materials for some creeping crops are mainly obtained from living parts of the same plants.</li>
                <li>Vegetative planting materials can be obtained from farmers or agricultural training centers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Pupils activity: Collecting planting materials.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Slasher/panga/jembe/rake/a shovel/manure</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seeds can be obtained from the mature fruits and then dried.</li>
        <li>Vine cuttings and splits can be obtained from the same plants or from agricultural training centers and horticultural research stations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Planting Creeping Crops</h2>
    <p>A planting site should be prepared before planting the crops. Before planting the creeping crops, we should also prepare the planting materials for better establishment.</p>
    
    <h3>Preparing a Seedbed</h3>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slasher or panga</li>
        <li>Jembe</li>
        <li>Rake</li>
        <li>Shovel</li>
        <li>Fully decomposed manure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clear any vegetation on the selected site.</li>
        <li>Dig the land to loosen the soil and remove all weeds.</li>
        <li>Break all the large soil clods to obtain fine soil.</li>
        <li>Spread well-rotten manure over the surface of the land. Mix the manure with soil.</li>
        <li>Level the seedbed.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Preparing Planting Materials from Seeds</h3>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knife/water/open container/mature fruit of a creeping crop</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a ripe fruit into two parts.</li>
        <li>Scoop out the seeds.</li>
        <li>Clean the seeds with cold water to remove the pulp.</li>
        <li>Spread the seeds in an open container and dry them in the sun for a few days.</li>
        <li>Select the good seeds for planting and store them in a cool, dry place.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Seeds selected for planting should be clean, whole/unbroken, free from insect damage, big in size, and of uniform color.</p>
    
    <h3>Preparing Other Planting Materials (Splits and Vines)</h3>
    <p>To raise new strawberry plants, a strawberry with many crowns is lifted from the soil and then broken into several parts called splits. Each split has some roots, stem, and leaves. It grows into a new plant once it is planted in a hole.</p>
    <p>Young vines of sweet potatoes are cut into several pieces, each measuring 30 cm. Each of the vine cuttings will develop roots when the larger part of it is buried in the soil.</p>
    
    <p>Pupils activity: Planting creeping crops.</p>
    
    <h2>Care for Young Creeping Crops</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Watering or Irrigating the Crops:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Water the crops when the weather is dry.</li>
                <li>The best time for watering the crops is early in the morning or in the evening when it is cool.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the soil is moist and not too wet.</li>
                <li>Avoid applying water directly on the leaves.</li>
                <li>Drip irrigation should be encouraged since it does not over-wet the soil and leaves, which can lead to the fast spread of diseases.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mulching the Crops:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps to conserve moisture as well as reduce weed growth.</li>
                <li>Also helps to obtain clean fruits since fruits do not touch the soil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Weeding:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove weeds from time to time throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li>When using tools to weed, do not damage the roots or vines of the crop.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Protecting the Crop from Physical Damage:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Make a structure to protect the creeping crops from damage by humans and animals.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shading:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide shade in case it is very hot and dry during the growing season.</li>
                <li>It helps to reduce wilting of crops due to too much evaporation and transpiration.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Top Dressing with Manures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply organic manure around each crop at the base from time to time.</li>
                    <li>You can use compost manure from animals.</li>
                    <li>Adequate nutrients help creeping crops to grow fast and produce big leaves and fruits.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Training the Crops:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build a structure to support your vine crop to grow upwards.</li>
                    <li>You can also train the young crop by moving the tip of the trailing vines to the desired place.</li>
                    <li>Helps the plant to receive adequate sunlight and occupy a small space within a given environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Conservation Project: Managing Creeping Crops</h3>
        <p>Pupils work: Managing creeping crops means taking care of the established crops so that they can grow healthy and produce high yields. A project schedule plan can be used to effectively manage creeping crops. Everyone involved should take responsibility in ensuring the crops are effectively managed.</p>
        
        <h2>Harvesting Creeping Crops</h2>
        <p>Creeping crops should be harvested when the produce is mature and ready for consumption or marketing. Harvesting the crop at the right stage is important because premature or late harvesting leads to wastage of the produce. Harvesting should be done carefully to avoid destruction of the produce.</p>
        
        <h3>Identifying the Right Stage for Harvesting Crops</h3>
        <p>Pupils activity: Learn how to identify the right stage for harvesting creeping crops.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Harvest Creeping Crops</h3>
        <p>Produce from creeping crops should be harvested appropriately to avoid wastage. Poor harvesting may lead to losses during harvesting.</p>
        <p>Pupils activity: Learn and practice proper harvesting techniques for creeping crops.</p>
        
        <h3>Harvesting and Disposal of Creeping Crops Produce</h3>
        <p>Pupils activity: Harvest and dispose of the produce from creeping crops responsibly.</p>
        
        <h2>Value of Creeping Crops in Our Environment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creeping crops are important because they provide food for our communities.</li>
            <li>Watermelons and strawberries provide vitamins which protect us against diseases.</li>
            <li>They are good sources of fiber which improves digestion.</li>
            <li>Creeping crops protect the soil against erosion due to their trailing growth habit.</li>
            <li>Creeping crops can be grown any time of the year. Many of them have no seasons. They can provide food security for our community.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Pupils activity: Discuss and appreciate the value of creeping crops in our environment.</p>
        
        <p>Remember, creeping crops are valuable components of a sustainable and diverse agricultural system. Embrace their cultivation and care for a bountiful harvest and a healthier environment.</p>
