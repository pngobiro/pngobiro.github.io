   <h2>God's Power</h2>
   <h3>How God's power helped Samson to defeat his enemies</h3>
   <p>Judges 15:14-17</p>
   <ul>
       <li>He was the son of Manoah.</li>
       <li>He asked God for strength.</li>
       <li>He married Delilah.</li>
       <li>God's power enabled Samson to fight and kill his enemies, the Philistines.</li>
       <li>God is able to empower us when we put our trust in Him.</li>
   </ul>
   <img src="samson-and-delilah.jpg" alt="Samson and Delilah">
   <p>Delilah noticed that Samson's strength was in his hair and she planned a way to hand over Samson to the Philistines.</p>
   <p>The Philistines' king met together and celebrated and offered great sacrifices to their god Dagon. They sang, "Our god has given us victory over our enemy Samson."</p>
   <p>Samson said to the boy who was leading him by the hand, "Let me touch the pillars that hold up the building. I want to lean on them."</p>
   <p>There were Philistines' kings and about 3000 men and women under the roof watching Samson.</p>
   <p>Samson pushed the pillars with all his strength and the building went down, killing all the people. Samson killed more people at his death than he had killed during his lifetime.</p>

   <h3>How Christians depend on God's power to overcome challenges</h3>
   <p>The story of Samson defeating his enemies teaches us that we should rely on God to help us overcome challenges. Whenever we go through a challenge, we should put our trust in God to help us overcome it.</p>

   <h2>Faith In God</h2>
   <h3>How Elisha recovered an axe head</h3>
   <p>2 Kings 6:1-7</p>
   <ol>
       <li>The company of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.</li>
       <li>Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet."</li>
       <li>And he said, "Go."</li>
       <li>Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?" "I will," Elisha replied.</li>
       <li>And he went with them.</li>
       <li>They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.</li>
       <li>As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axehead fell into the water. "Oh no, my lord!" he cried out. "It was borrowed!"</li>
       <li>The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.</li>
       <li>"Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>How Christians apply faith in God in day to day living</h3>
   <p>Elisha recovered an axe-head because he had faith in God. The story of Elisha recovering the axe-head teaches us to have faith in God when faced with challenges. We should have faith in God to experience great things. We should also pray when faced with challenges.</p>

   <h2>Determination</h2>
   <h3>Lessons learnt from the story of Jacob wrestling with God</h3>
   <p>Genesis 32:22-30</p>
   <ol>
       <li>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</li>
       <li>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</li>
       <li>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.</li>
       <li>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</li>
       <li>Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."</li>
       <li>The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.</li>
       <li>Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."</li>
       <li>Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.</li>
       <li>So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."</li>
   </ol>
