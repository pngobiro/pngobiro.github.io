    <h2>Using God Given Talents And Abilities</h2>
    <p>According to the Bible, we should appreciate and use our God-given talents and abilities well. The book of Exodus 31:3 and Romans 12:4 teach us that we should use our talents and abilities to serve God and others, seek advice on how to utilize them, and pray for God's guidance to use them responsibly.</p>

    <h3>Talents</h3>
    <p>Talents are special gifts that God has given us, natural abilities to do certain things, such as music, art, or athletics.</p>

    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    <p>Abilities are skills that enable us to do things well. They are the power to use a certain skill or power to accomplish something, and can be learned in school or from others, such as painting.</p>

    <h3>Values learners can use to nurture talents and abilities</h3>
    <p>Learners can use the following values to nurture their talents and abilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Responsibility</li>

        <li>Social justice</li>
        <li>Hard work</li>
        <li>Peace</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learners can nurture their talents and abilities by serving others, practicing daily, praying for God's guidance, being committed, and working hard.</p>

    <h2>Marriage And Family</h2>
    <h3>Biblical teaching on marriage as an example of Christian living</h3>
    <p>According to Genesis 2:20-24, marriage is a legally recognized union between a man and a woman, ordained by God. God created a woman from man's rib to be a companion and helper. Christians should respect the institution of marriage, as it is highly valued and forms the foundation of a strong nation.</p>
    <p>Some Christian teachings on marriage include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marriage was established by God</li>
        <li>Courtship should be pure and mature</li>
        <li>Fornication is not allowed</li>
        <li>Procreation should be within marriage</li>
        <li>Love and faithfulness are the cornerstones of marriage</li>
        <li>The wife should submit to the husband</li>
        <li>Celibacy is a gift from God, but not for all people</li>
        <li>Widows and widowers can remarry to avoid temptations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of marriage</h3>
    <p>There are three types of marriage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Christian marriage: Conducted by a priest or a pastor in a place of worship.</li>
     
        <li>African customary marriage: Conducted in accordance with the customs of the community of either one or both parties.</li>

    <h3>Reasons for discouraging early marriages in the society</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>All children have a right to education, health, and protection</li>
        <li>Early marriages affect children's development</li>
        <li>Early marriages violate the rights of a child</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>God's Rest</h2>
    <h3>Leisure</h3>
    <p>Leisure is the time when we are free from work or studies.</p>

    <h3>The teaching of the Bible on God's rest as a form of leisure</h3>
    <p>According to Genesis 2:1-3 and 1 Timothy 5:13, God rested on the seventh day because all that he had created was good, and his work was finished. He wanted to teach us that we too should rest. Christians rest on the Sabbath day to follow God's example. The Bible teaches that God sanctioned rest when he made the Sabbath, which is sanctified as a holy day of rest. Christians should observe the Sabbath and keep it holy.</p>

    <h3>The teaching of the Bible on the use of leisure time</h3>
    <p>The Bible teaches that leisure is a gift from God and should be used properly. It provides us with the opportunity to worship God, and Christians should use their leisure to serve God and others.</p>
    <p>There are two types of leisure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Active leisure: Involves physical activities such as sports, games, and dancing.</li>
        <li>Passive leisure: Has minimal or no physical activity, such as watching television, reading, listening to music, or sleeping.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Christians can use their leisure time to visit the needy, such as the sick and the aged, or participate in church activities.</p>

    <h3>Values which help Christians to use leisure time properly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Responsibility</li>
        <li>Unity</li>
        <li>Integrity</li>
        <li>Social justice</li>
        <li>Hard work</li>
        <li>Peace</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inappropriate ways of using time in society</h3>
    <p>Some inappropriate ways of using leisure are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spending too much time on passive leisure activities</li>
        <li>Spending leisure in idle talk</li>
        <li>Spending leisure taking drugs and other substances</li>
        <li>Engaging in immoral activities during leisure time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This may be caused by peer pressure, curiosity, idleness, lack of guidance, or having too much money.</p>
    <p>Activities that misuse leisure include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pre-marital sex</li>
        <li>Abusing drugs</li>
        <li>Idling and gossiping</li>
        <li>Over-indulging in the same activities</li>
