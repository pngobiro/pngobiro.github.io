  <h2>Skills in Volleyball</h2>
  <h3>1. Dig Pass</h3>
  <p>The dig pass is a fundamental skill in volleyball used to receive a serve or spike ball. It involves two variations:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          <h4>a. Single Hand Dig Pass</h4>
          <p>The single hand dig pass is used when the ball cannot be reached with both hands. The player uses one hand to receive or pass the ball.</p>
