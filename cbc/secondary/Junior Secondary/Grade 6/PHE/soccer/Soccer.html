  <h2>Trapping</h2>
  <p>Trapping involves receiving and controlling the ball in a soccer game.</p>

  <h3>Trapping - Using the Thigh</h3>
  <p>The thigh trap is where a player controls the ball with the upper part of the leg between the knee and the hips; this part is called the thigh. The thigh trap is applied when the ball is below the chest level but too high to be controlled using the foot.</p>

  <h4>Safety Instructions</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Avoid pushing and kicking one another while playing.</li>
      <li>Wear appropriate attire while playing.</li>
      <li>Warm up before and cool down the body after the activities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Warm Up Activity</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Jog around the marked area with moderate arm action and moderate knee lift.</li>
      <li>Chase and tag partners within the marked area.</li>
      <li>Knee raiser; from a standing position, raise your right and left knees in turns. Perform the activity for 20 seconds continuously.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Walk at a moderate speed, swinging arms up and down.</li>
      <li>From a standing position, arms are raised up, stretching the body upwards, breathing in deeply.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Learning Points</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Stand feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
      <li>Face the direction of the oncoming ball.</li>
      <li>Elbows should be away from your body for balance.</li>
      <li>Lift the thigh so that it is horizontal to the balance leg.</li>
      <li>As the ball makes contact with the thigh, drop the thigh to cushion the ball to the feet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trapping - Using the Chest</h3>
  <p>Chest trap involves controlling, stopping, or bringing the ball under control using the chest. This may be done to a flight or to a bouncing ball.</p>

      <li>Rhythmical jumps - Make jumps landing on the balls of the feet. Start with jumping a low height and later a higher height. The hands should contact the knees while jumping.</li>
      <li>Trunk rotation - Start with the feet shoulder-width apart and hands akimbo. Rotate the upper part of the body by leaning backwards, leaning to the right side, forward, and then to the left side.</li>
      <li>Half squats - From a standing position, hands raised upwards, make a half squat maintaining upright posture.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Walk at a moderate speed, swinging hands round.</li>
      <li>From a standing position, hands raised up, stretch the body upwards, breathing upright posture.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Learning Points</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Stand feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
      <li>Face the direction of the oncoming ball.</li>
      <li>Arms extended forward with an open chest.</li>
      <li>Lean slightly backwards to cushion the ball on the moment of contact.</li>
      <li>Recover to a normal upright position after trapping the ball.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>OR</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Stand feet shoulder-width apart, facing the oncoming ball.</li>
      <li>The body should be positioned behind the flight of the ball.</li>
      <li>The knees should be slightly bent.</li>
      <li>Elbows should be held away from the body, and hands clear of the chest.</li>
      <li>Bend at the waist and lean forward over the rising ball.</li>
      <li>Withdraw the chest immediately after the ball is touched to cushion it back down to your feet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trapping - Using the Sole</h3>
  <p>Trapping using the sole involves placing the foot on top of the ball while the ball is in play to prevent it from bouncing off or rolling away.</p>
