Do not breathe in the middle of a musical sentence because it will interrupt the flow. In order to sing a whole phrase, you need to have enough breath. Take a short breath only at the end of a musical phrase.</p> <pre>Ee Mungu nguvu yetu Ilete baraka kwetu Haki iwe ngao na mlinzi Na tukae na udugu Amani na uhuru Raha tupate na ustawi.</pre>



<h2>Voice Blending</h2>
<p>Voice blending is singing with a unified sound. When performing in a group, it is advisable to balance your voices. To sing with a good voice blend, ensure that you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sing confidently</li>
    <li>Start and stop at the same time when singing in a group</li>
    <li>Sound the vowels and consonants appropriately</li>
    <li>Sing at the same volume with others</li>
    <li>Sing at the same speed as other singers</li>
    <li>Sing the same pitch with others</li>
</ul>
<pre>See Saw Margery Daw,

Jacky shall have a new master;
Jacky shall earn but a penny a day,
Because he can't work any faster.</pre>


<h2>Performance Cues</h2>
<p>Performance cues are directions given to the performer to guide their performance. Performance cues include soft, loud, fast, slow, crescendo, and diminuendo. Crescendo means gradually getting louder or gradually increasing the volume. Diminuendo means getting softer or gradually decreasing the volume. When performance cues are gradually followed, the music becomes interesting. Performance cues also bring out the mood of a song and improve the voice.</p>

<pre>Goosey goosey gander,

Whither shall I wander?
Upstairs and downstairs
And in my lady's chamber.
There I met an old man
Who wouldn't say his prayers,
So I took him by his left leg
And threw him down the stair</pre>

A pocket full of posies
A tissue, a tissue
We all fall down

To fetch a pail of water

Is singing to the people
A tissue, a tissue
We all fall down
The wedding bells are ringing</pre>
