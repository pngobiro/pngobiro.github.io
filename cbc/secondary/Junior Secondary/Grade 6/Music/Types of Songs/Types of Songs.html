    <h3>Lyrics: The Path to the Moon</h3>
    <p>Eric H. Thiman | Choir</p>
    <pre>
        I long to sail on a path to the moon
        On a de-ep blue night
        when the wind is cool
        A glist'ning Path that runs out to sea
        Silver the sails to carry me

        To ca--rry
        Ca--rry
        Ca--rry me over the sea

        So will I sail on a stary night
        on the path to the moon, a sea bird's flight!
        Skimming the waves where the fishes play
        Traveling on for many a day

        Silver the sails to carry me,
        to ca--rry
        ca--rry
        ca--rry me over the sea!
    </pre>
