  <h1>Main Physical Features in Eastern Africa</h1>

  <h2>The Main Physical Features In Kenya</h2>
  <p>Physical features are naturally things found on the surface of the earth. They include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mountains</li>
    <li>Valleys</li>
    <li>Plateaus</li>
    <li>Ocean</li>
    <li>Seas</li>
    <li>Gorges</li>
    <li>Plains</li>
    <li>Lakes</li>
    <li>Rivers</li>
    <li>Swamps</li>
    <li>Hills, rangers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mountains</h3>
  <p>Mountains are masses of very high land. They are the highest physical features on the earth. Major mountains in Eastern Africa include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kenya: Mt. Kenya, Mt. Longonot, Mt. Marsabit, Mt. Kulal</li>
    <li>Tanzania: Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Meru, Pare Mountains, Ngorongoro Crater</li>
    <li>Uganda: Ruwenzori</li>
    <li>Sudan: Jabel-marra</li>
    <li>Ethiopia: Ras Dashan, Guna, Danakil Alps, Menengai Crater, Lool Molaisin</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rift Valley</h3>
  <p>A valley is a low-lying area with steep slopes. In Eastern Africa, the Rift Valley has two branches that stretch across several countries: the Eastern Rift Valley and the Western Rift Valley.</p>

  <h3>Lakes</h3>
  <p>A lake is a water body that is surrounded by land. Eastern Africa has both freshwater and saltwater lakes. The main lakes in the region include:</p>

  <h3>Plains</h3>
  <p>Plains are low-lying areas of almost flat land. Examples of plains in Eastern Africa include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kenya: Lotikipi, Awara, Kano, Kaputei, Loita, Budalangi, Kapiti</li>
    <li>Uganda: Luwero, Nakasongola, Bilesha</li>
    <li>Tanzania: Serengeti, Maasai</li>
    <li>Somalia: Bilesha, Sarar, Haded</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Formation Of Main Physical Features Of Eastern Africa</h2>

  <h3>Formation Of Volcanic Mountains</h3>
  <p>Volcanic mountains, also called volcanoes, are formed through the process of volcanicity or eruption. When hot molten material (magma) underground is forced out by great pressure, it erupts and reaches the surface as lava. The opening at the top of a volcanic mountain is called a crater.</p>

  <h3>Formation of Block Mountains</h3>
  <p>Block mountains, also called horst mountains, are formed through faulting and uplifting processes. Faults are lines of weakness in the earth's crust, and the middle block between the faults is pushed upward by underground forces called thrust forces.</p>

  <h3>Formation Of The Rift Valley</h3>
  <p>The Rift Valley was formed when two cracks or fault lines formed within the crustal rocks, and the land between the two faults sank, forming a valley. This process was caused by tensional or compressional forces.</p>

  <h3>Formation Of Lakes</h3>
  <p>The major lakes in Eastern Africa were formed as a result of:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Faulting</li>
    <li>River deposition</li>
    <li>Downwarping</li>
    <li>Volcanicity</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Rift Valley Lakes</h4>
  <p>During the formation of the Rift Valley, some parts of the land sank deeper than others, forming depressions that were filled with water to create lakes, such as Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania.</p>

  <h4>Lakes Formed As A Result Of Downwarping</h4>
  <p>Downwarping is a process by which the earth sinks inwards due to pressure, forming a basin that is filled with water to create a lake, such as Lake Victoria in Kenya.</p>

  <h4>Lakes Formed As A Result Of Volcanicity</h4>
  <p>Lava-dammed lakes are formed when lava flow blocks a river, creating a lake. Crater lakes are formed when a volcanic eruption blows off the top of a mountain, creating a hollow depression that is filled with water.</p>

  <h3>Formation Of Plains</h3>
  <p>Plains are formed as a result of erosion and deposition of the eroded materials.</p>

  <h2>Conserving The Physical Features Within The Locality</h2>
  <p>To protect and conserve the physical features in our locality, we should:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prevent overuse and deforestation of forests</li>
    <li>Avoid pollution of water bodies</li>
    <li>Educate people on the importance of physical features</li>
  </ol>
