<h1>Exploring Culture and Community</h1> 
</header>
<main>

    <h2>What is Culture?</h2> 
    <p>Culture is like a special recipe that makes each group of people unique! It's the way they live, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The languages they speak</li>
        <li>The yummy food they eat</li>
        <li>The clothes they wear</li>
        <li>How they celebrate and worship</li>
        <li>The games and sports they enjoy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Age Groups and Age Sets</h2> 
    <p>In some African traditions, people belong to special groups based on their age:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age Set:</strong> This is like a club of people who are around the same age and share similar experiences. They stay connected throughout their lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Group:</strong> This includes everyone born during a specific time period, like everyone born in the same year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Clan System</h2>
    <p>A clan is like a big family with a shared ancestor. Imagine a family tree that keeps growing for many generations!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clans are usually traced through the male lineage (fathers, grandfathers, etc.).</li>
        <li>People from the same clan are considered relatives and are not allowed to marry each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions of a Clan</h3>
    <p>Clans play an important role in society:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solving problems and disagreements among members</li>
        <li>Managing land and resources together</li>
        <li>Creating a sense of belonging and identity</li>
        <li>Setting rules and traditions for the group</li>
        <li>Organizing important events and ceremonies</li>
        <li>Teaching young people about their culture</li>
        <li>Supporting each other during difficult times</li>
        <li>Practicing shared beliefs and traditions</li>
        <li>Protecting the group from outside threats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preserving African Traditions</h2>
    <p>Many aspects of African culture are worth keeping alive, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional foods and recipes</li>
        <li>Ceremonies and festivals</li>
        <li>Music and dance styles</li>
        <li>Unique languages</li>
        <li>Fun games and sports</li>
        <li>Beautiful clothing and styles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>School and Community</h2>
    <p>Schools are places where we learn and grow, but they are also part of a larger community.</p>
    <h3>Collaboration between School and Community</h3>
    <p>Schools can work together with the community in many ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing school facilities like playgrounds or halls for community events during weekends or holidays.</li>
        <!-- Add more examples of school-community collaboration as needed --> 
    </ul>
