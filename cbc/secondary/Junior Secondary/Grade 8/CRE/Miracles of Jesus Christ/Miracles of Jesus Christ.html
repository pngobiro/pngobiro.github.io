    <h2>The Healing of Blind Bartimaeus</h2>

    <p>People who were present asked him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder. Jesus Christ stopped and asked the people to call Bartimaeus.</p>

    <p>Bartimaeus threw off his cloak, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</p>

    <p>Jesus Christ asked Bartimaeus what he wanted Him to do for him. Bartimaeus said he wanted to see again.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a strong wind blew up, and the water began to spill over into the boat.</p>

    <p>The boat was about to get filled with water. It was about to capsize.</p>

    <p>All this while, Jesus Christ continued to sleep.</p>

    <h2>The Healing of the Paralytic</h2>

    <p>When Jesus Christ was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the Law were present.</p>

    <p>They had come from every town in Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>As Jesus Christ taught, He also healed the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a bed.</p>

    <p>They tried to carry him into the house, but because of the crowd, there was no space, so they made an opening on the roof and lowered the sick man down on his bed in front of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>When Jesus Christ saw how much faith they had, He told the paralyzed man that his sins were forgiven.</p>

    <p>The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees wondered among themselves who Jesus Christ was to speak such blasphemy.</p>

    <p>They felt that it is only God who had power to forgive sins.</p>

    <p>Jesus Christ knew their thoughts and asked them why they thought the way they did.</p>

    <p>To prove to them that He had the power to forgive, He told the paralyzed man to get up, pick his bed, and go home.</p>

    <p>The man got up in front of all of them, took his bed, and went home praising God.</p>

        <li>We should be creative when seeking solutions to challenges in life.</li>

    <h3>The Pharisees' Opposition to the Healing of the Paralytic</h3>

    <p>Blasphemy is speaking or acting in a manner that does not respect God. When Jesus Christ told the paralyzed man that his sins were forgiven, the Pharisees and teachers of the Law accused Him of blasphemy.</p>

    <p>The following are reasons why the Pharisees accused Jesus Christ of blasphemy:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They believed that only God can forgive sins.</li>
        <li>Pharisees and the teachers of the Law questioned the authority of Jesu Christ as they did not believe that Jesus Christ was God.</li>
        <li>They did not acknowledge Jesus Christ was God.</li>
        <li>Pharisees did not understand the mission of Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When Faced with Challenges, We Should Apply Faith in God by:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Praying to God.</li>
        <li>Asking church leaders and other Christians to help us pray.</li>
        <li>Seeking help from people who are experienced in providing solutions to our problems.</li>
        <li>Obeying and following instructions from those in authority.</li>
        <li>Believing in the power of God to change our situations.</li>
        <li>Resisting the opposition of our enemies and avoiding distractions.</li>
