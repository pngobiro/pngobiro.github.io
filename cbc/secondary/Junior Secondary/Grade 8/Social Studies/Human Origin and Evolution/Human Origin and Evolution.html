    <h1>Human Origin and Evolution</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Scientific Theory about Human Origin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The scientific theory about human origin is also called the evolution theory.</li>
        <li>It was developed by Charles Darwin.</li>
        <li>The theory argues that all living organisms underwent processes of change over millions of years by evolving from simple forms to complex forms.</li>
        <li>This happened through the processes of:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Mutation - human organisms went through changes in their genes and the behavior of their bodies.</li>
            <li>Natural selection - after mutation, only the fittest or strongest organisms survived.</li>
            <li>Adaptation - after surviving mutation and natural selection, the organisms adapted to their new environment.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Fossil Records</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fossils refer to the preserved remains of plants and animals that are found beneath the surface of the earth.</li>
        <li>Fossil records help to understand how human beings evolved, lived, adapted, and changed their physical appearance in the past.</li>
        <li>The importance of fossil records includes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide past evidence on how plants and animals adapted to their environment.</li>
            <li>Helps to establish evolutionary relationships between organisms and their ancestors.</li>
            <li>Fossil records help to establish the time period in which organisms lived.</li>
            <li>Fossil records help archaeologists and other natural scientists to place important events and species in the appropriate historical and geographical era.</li>
            <li>Fossil records of humans help us to understand the social, political, and economic life of man over the years.</li>
            <li>They give us information on the culture of humans, clothing, food, and beliefs in the past.</li>
            <li>Fossil records give us information on the economic activities of man, such as the animals they hunted, crops they cultivated, fishing, among others.</li>
            <li>Fossil records give us information on the type and uses of tools and other materials used by humans in farming, hunting, war, or religious activities over the years.</li>
            <li>They provide evidence of Africa being the cradle of humanity.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Locations of Human Remains Discovered in Africa</h2>

        <li>Prehistoric sites are places where man's remains, which are evident of his past existence, were found.</li>
        <li>The oldest known human remains in Africa were discovered in Ethiopia, dating back to around 200,000 years ago.</li>

    <h2>Changes that Took Place in Humans as a Result of Evolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Evolution of human beings has been a continuous process resulting from various changes and adaptations.</li>
        <li>These changes are characterized in their teeth, arms, body shape, brain size, structure of their legs, and shape of their head.</li>
        <li>These changes were important for them to adapt to new environmental conditions for survival.</li>
        <li>Human beings evolved to walk on two legs, freeing their hands for tool use and enhancing mobility.</li>
        <li>Over time, the human brain had grown, leading to advanced cognitive abilities.</li>
        <li>They developed the ability to make and use tools.</li>
        <li>Humans developed language, enabling communication.</li>
        <li>Evolution influenced teeth, adapting them to a diverse diet including plants and animals.</li>
        <li>Humans evolved complex social structures, forming family units and communities.</li>
        <li>Humans have had reduced hair on their bodies.</li>
