    <h1>1.3 Population Growth in Africa</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Population Growth</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Population growth is determined by carrying out a national census and comparing the outcome with the previous census outcome.</li>
        <li>Population growth can either be positive or negative.</li>
        <li>Positive population growth results when the birth rates and immigration rates are higher than death rates and emigration rates.</li>
        <li>Negative population growth rate occurs when there are some people leaving a population through death or emigration as compared to those joining it through birth and immigration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of Population Growth in Africa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High fertility rates - African countries have high birth rates due to cultural, social, and economic factors.</li>
        <li>Declining mortality rates - improved healthcare, access to clean water, and advancement in medical technology have led to lower infant and child mortality rates.</li>
        <li>Urbanization - rapid urbanization in Africa has led to increased migration from rural areas to cities in search of better opportunities.</li>
        <li>Lack of education - lack of education limits individual understanding of the family planning methods and contraceptives which results in high birth rates.</li>
        <li>Natural calamities - natural calamities such as drought and famine result in high deaths in Africa, slowing down the rate of population growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effects of Population Growth in Africa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Over-exploitation of resources.</li>
        <li>Unemployment and poverty due to few employment opportunities.</li>
        <li>Shortage of social amenities.</li>
        <li>Increased innovation.</li>
        <li>Development of urban centres due to increased population.</li>
        <li>Food insecurity.</li>
        <li>Increased crime rates.</li>
        <li>Ready markets for goods and services.</li>
        <li> Increase in supply of human labour.</li>
        <li>Deforestation to provide human settlement.</li>
        <li>Strain on limited resources such as land, water, and food, and in infrastructure and services such as housing, transportation, and sanitation.</li>
        <li>Loss of culture and diminishing of trust among citizens.</li>
        <li>Rise in dependency ratio which increases the economic pressure on the work force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Migration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Migration refers to the movement of people from one place to another.</li>
        <li>The place that people move from is called the place of origin.</li>
        <li>The place people move to is called the place of destination.</li>
        <li>People migrate due to different reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Migration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal migration - this is the movement of people within a country.</li>
        <li>Rural to urban migration - migration involving people moving from rural areas to urban areas.</li>
        <li>Urban to Rural migration - involve moving from urban areas to rural areas.</li>
        <li>Rural to rural migration - involves moving rural areas to other rural areas.</li>
        <li>Urban to urban migration - involves moving from one urban centre to another.</li>
        <li>External migration - migration of people from their country to other countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effects of Migration in Africa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Development of urban centres due to increase in population.</li>
        <li>Congestion of urban areas due to increase in the population.</li>
        <li>Migration results in cultural diversity.</li>
        <li>Growth of slums due to poor living conditions.</li>
        <li>Pressure on public services such as schools, housing, and healthcare.</li>
        <li>Separation of families.</li>
        <li>Money sent to home countries in form of remittances boosts the local economy.</li>
        <li>Results in rural areas having more elderly people as the younger ones migrate in search of a better life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Demographic Trends in Kenya</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Population growth - Kenya's population has been growing steadily over the years, and it is currently estimated to around 50m people.</li>
        <li>Urbanization - more and more Kenyans are moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better opportunities.</li>
        <li>Age structure - Kenya has a relatively young population, with a large proportion of people under the age of 30.</li>
        <li>Ethic diversity - Kenya is home to many different ethic groups, each with its own language and culture.</li>
        <li>Health and mortality - Kenya has made significant progress in improving health outcomes recently, but challenges remain.</li>
    </ul>
